We went up and made it a harder loop and came down the waterfall trail, well worth the extra work."", ""Their policy has changed - you must have a reservation on the weekends even to hike!  It's a one lane road in and out and they turned cars away at the park making for really bad traffic jams.  And the ranger told us you can't park outside Sveadal and walk through there, either.  So a long drive for nothing."", 'So beautiful and serene, and such a great, well-maintained/informational hike. At the campground and trailhead you can pick up a map and a guided nature hike flier with information about the different plants and wildlife in the canyon. The Waterfall Loop is a lush hike through a coastal redwood riparian environment. You’ll feel like you’re in Big Sur right here in Watsonville. Also, this is the absolute best time to go (I’m writing this in January 2018), as it is technically closed, and you will have it all to yourself. Closure is only due to the road being washed out. Access via the Knibb’s Knob trailhead at the back of the park off Summit Rd (see Maymens Flat and Knibb’s Knob Trail page). You don’t necessarily need 4WD, but it is certainly helpful.

Beautiful, easy hike with kids (ages 5 and 12). The signage isn't the best so take a map."", 'beautiful hike along the creek... lots of waterfalls.

Not really any vistas up there and a very steep climb.  Keep it simple and enjoy all the waterfalls."", 'Early September and yet the spring fed creek is enough for most of the waterfalls along this trail to be active.

I like to do the Waterloop Trail, then adding Contour and Triple Falls to finish up. Keep an eye out for snakes! Nearly stepped on one the last time I did the Triple Falls trail.

Will have to come back in January when waterfalls are more full', 'Lovely canyon trail with waterfalls and wooded vistas.', 'Lovely canyon with Vistas and wooded hills.', 'After a failed first attempt to come here because of being turned back due to no parking, this time I got a parking spot.  Very nice place to bring kids.  Trails are easy for them and scenery is exceptional.  Seeing the waterfalls is worth coming to this remote location.  Loved it this time.', ""Just visited during a moderate rain storm. Arrived at 4pm on 12MAR16 and there was plenty of parking. Beautiful and not challenging hike up the hill. waterfalls were a site for sore eyes after years of drought. Very nice place to enjoy nature and water. I will certainly be back. There's also an adjacent camp ground that's pretty nice."", ""Not happy to arrive here 2-14-16 at 11:30am and to be turned around for a lack of parking.  All of the cars in my timeframe had to leave the park for same reason.  In addition, not many places to park on road coming in and walk in as it's all private property.  Sad to drive all the way out here and not get to enjoy it."", ""Nice park with well maintained trails. Just make sure to visit in the spring or after a rain. It's ugly and boring in the summer when all the waterfalls are dry."", 'We went up the steep side and back down on the falls side. The first part is very steep at one point 34% grade. It was a nice hike my wife and I made it but by the end our legs were tired. Coming back down on the falls side is almost all down hill. The trails at some points were very small and walking polls would have helped. For someone in good shape it might not be bad bit for us it was a bit much. Still fun I we are going back. Day use area very nice bathrooms very clean. BBQ area. Still some water in the falls. We started at around 10 am next time we will start around 8 am, and take more time to look around. Watch for the poison oak. Some was very small we were in shorts. The trails were nice but again a bit narrow at times.', 'Beautilful!', 'It was a great colorful walk. Even in the drought we still had a lovely trickle of falls and a fun knobcone summit. Trail maps and flushable toilets are available at the parking lot', ""Hiked for the first time here today. It is definitely a lovely place. My favorite things about this: it's dog friendly, lots of shaded areas and has pretty scenery."", 'Perfect place', 'Great hike.

My 5 year old son had a blast and the trails are fun and interesting enough to keep him motivated to finish.', ""This is a great, not so hard, hike through Uvas Canyon.  Waterfalls are a great draw and definitely the highlight of the area.

Feb is a good time to go water falls are gushing out more. $6. parking fee/ bathrooms.', 'Beautiful hike, a lot of uphill climbing on the first part of the hike.  Trails are marked well and loved the waterfall.', ""Beautiful hike! I'd recommend going when it has recently rained so there is more water. There was barely any water when I hiked (because of the drought!) but it would be gorgeous with more water. Very peaceful and shady. Kid friendly."", 'Excellent hike.  We took Alec canyon spur to triple falls then looped from contour trail to waterfall loop.  4.9mi and great ups and downs with some nice waterfalls to boot!', ""Did this hike in late December with the family including my parents who are in their 50's  and a couple of 9 year-olds. There is a $6 fee to park, takes cash or credit (37.084636, -121.792467). It was very cool, but not too cold to effect our enjoyment of the hike. We took the Alec Canyon trail to triples falls first, then back tracked to the Contour Trail to the water fall loop. Very scenic hike with nice restrooms too! I recommend this hike for anyone in the Morgan Hill area looking for a fun, safe, and scenic hike that is family and pet friendly."", ""This was a great hike. We did the waterfall loop. Eventhough it was a short hike, it has a steep climb. One of the falls didn't have any water because of the drought but the rest of the falls had some. It was a good workout."", ""I've only hiked as far as the Hot House Site and back to the trailhead.  Haven't done the entire loop as far as hiking through the Canyon trail.  If you want to hike a trail with waterfall along the way, this is it!  There's even a small area along the way to the waterfalls where you can chill at a table and enjoy the quiet shaded area.  I've even seen people relax there and study whatever educational materials they had with them.  There is even an area where you can see a small trickle of what the sign said was natural spring water coming down from the Santa Cruz Mountains, which I thought was cool.  The part of the trail I hiked does have an incline, so beware!"", ""The 6 miles length that this page refers to is not the length of the waterfall loop. The waterfall loop is only about 2 miles. There is another loop, Alec Canyon I think, which would get you up to the 6 miles length.\n\nThis loop is rated as moderate but I would actually rate it as strenuous. It's short, but there are several steep climbs that left me, a seasoned hiker, short of breath and needing a break. The waterfalls weren't much when we went in May of 2014, however I expect that's due to the drought and hope they'd be better next spring after we hopefully have a nice, rainy winter. Take the Alec Canyon trail to Triple Falls if you can muster it - the view from the side of the hill is incredible. We were good with 1.5 litres of water but drank it all (last sips were by the car in the parking lot).\n\nParking lot bathrooms are super clean and even have SOAP!!! (Rare in state parks, we've found)"", 'I took 4 kids under 5 up to the falls. Bathrooms were super clean at the parking lot. It is tough to find trails for littles. Take the lower trail on the way up and the upper trail on the way back.', ""I went here today from 11 am to about 2:30pm. My 6 & 7 year old enjoyed the sounds of nature instantly, as soon as I turned the car off and opened the door. The fresh air, the peace, the sounds of earth great!Very clean bathrooms by parking lot before your hike, so use it!! Took the waterfall loop, it's a peaceful fun trail. Makes your body work a little. Kids enjoyed plenty of small waterfalls, and of course the main one. Make a day of it. Pack a lunch there's picnic tables and it's just beautiful. We ran into two couples, other then that it was echoes."", 'Fun short hike with lots of waterfalls. Fun for the kids with a nice campground near by. Best after it rains.', ""With very little effort you can see many waterfalls at this park.  It can get pretty crowded, but it's a great place for a short hike."", ""Great Trail, waterfalls were ok- doesn't help we're in a drought."", 'Did this hike today. Not sure what trail we went on but it was steep.  Took about 30 min up and 30 min down.  Was great but very steep.  My son, niece and I were the only ones hiking at 9am.  As we left the park about 4 others showed up.  The park is beautiful!', 'We hiked the waterfall loop and Contour trail. These both are great for entry level hikers. In total the two trails were about 3 miles. The views are beautiful and worth the long trip to get here. ', 'Park opens 8am till sunset.  Trails open sunrise to sunset.\n\nParking $6.  It is possible to pay by credit card or cash using the automated machine at the entrance.  The machine said that it was out of change, so credit card or exact amount would probably be best.\n\nYou will drive on an easement through the Sveadal private resort(Sweedish American Patriotic League) to get to Uvas Canyon.  It is a single lane road with small pull off when there is oncoming traffic.  Don’t fall for the hurt Sweede in the middle of the road trick.  I got out to help and they kidnapped me.  Luckily I escaped and was able to get my hike in(The preceding lines about the hurt Sweede was a joke).\n\nArrived at 3pm on Labor Day.  Parking lot was about 60-70% full.\n\nThe hiking and area is quite nice.  There are a number of trails and short spurs off the trails.  The scenery was beautiful.  There were no mechanical noises or anything other than nature.  Water level was very low.  It has been 3-4 months without rain in the area.  No water at the Triple Falls or Basin Falls.  There was some water at the Upper Falls.\n\n\nWaterfall Trail – the main trail to see the falls.  It actually splits into 2 trails very early on.  One will be a single file trails that goes along the stream.  The other is a very wide dirt road(big enough for a car).  They are very close to each other.  85-90+% shaded.\n\nContour Trail –Really nice single file trail.  95+% shaded.\n\nAlec Canyon – an out and back trail about 4-8 feet wide.  80+% shaded.\n\nKnibbs Knob – didn’t hike this one.\n\nThe overview needs to be updated (I will see if the site lets me update it).  The total distance of the trails at Uvas Canyon would be about 10 miles covering all of them.  There is no single trail or loop that will get 10 miles.  \n-Doing the Waterfall Loop Trail and the Contour Trail will be about 3 miles.\n-If you also do the Alec Canyon Trail out and back it is another 2 miles with the spur trail.\n-The Knobcone adds 1 mile\n-Then the separate out and back Knibbs Knob Trail is ~4.4 miles out and back with the spur trail.\n\nThe flying bugs were very annoying.  Sure, the attention is flattering at first, but the neediness of the bugs gets very tiring quickly.  It may have been because it was in the afternoon and they were out in force.  Maybe in the morning it would not be so bad.  I used bug spray every 30-45 minutes or so to keep them away.  I sprayed my hat and arms and clothes.  \n\nIt would be great if the Knibbs Knob trail was connected with the Waterfall Loop and/or The Contour Trail.  That would be quite nice as then it would be a loop.  It would also be nice to connect them to the end of the Alec Canyon Trail.\n\nMore information here - Santa Clara County guide to their parks:\nhttp://www.sccgov.org/sites/parks/Maps%20Here/Pages/Uvas-Canyon-County-Park.aspx', 'Overall it is a very good trail: waterfalls are nice, shadow almost everywhere.

Loud, trash littered by the trail, and people playing music from their phones while walking on the trails. If you’re seeking solitude and a dip in the lake to cool off this is not the spot for you. Probably best to go on a very early morning. The location is beautiful, but the cons far outweigh the positive aspects in my opinion. Could probably be a better hike if you go further into nature away from the lake.', 'If you’re willing to go off trail a little bit, it’s the most fun spot in Malibu', 'Arrived at 8am.

Then we headed over to the rock pool and did a little more scrambling around the pond area. It was beautifully lush and green right now, which made for great photos. Trails were pretty flat once we descended down shortly past the trail head, and then some parts of the trail was really rocky and uneven, which made it fun. Shoes with good ankle support helped a lot. Other parts of the trail were soft and sandy. I kept on losing GPS signal so my recordings came out inaccurate and jagged. I had 3 apps tracking, but none of them came out right :-( Oh, watch out for poison oak in shadier areas.', 'Great hike! 7 miles round trip to see the dam about a mile past MASH site and ate lunch at a picnic table then headed to rock pools to swim and watch the climbers.

Plenty of different trails to split off to if you feel like mixing things up. Recent storms have really done a number on some of the trails however. We tried to get to the M*A*S*H site and were unable to due to flooding and the trails being covered by debris. Other than that, the trail itself is a blast.

It has enough trails to satisfy all fitness levels. Bring cash to pay for parking.', 'Will definitely be returning soon! Easy trail but the scenery is great and trail has multiple rock climbing locations. Stepped away from the trail and explored small areas near by. The more you look around the more you find.', ""I loved this! The Rock Pool was beautiful and yes, the water is safe to swim in. I went on a weekday, so the trail wasn't too heavily trafficked-neither was the Rock Pool. The trailhead I started from was on Mullhulland and across the street from the King Gillette Ranch. I did not have to pay for parking, nor did I even see a parking lot that charged. \nThe Rock Pool was hard to find, we actually ended up hiking 1.5 miles to Century Lake (at least I think It was Century Lake), and 1.5miles back (3 miles out of the way). So here is a tip for anyone hiking to the Rock Pool. If you took the same trailhead I did, you will come to a clearing that has three large porto-potties. Do not cross the bridge, and do not go to the right, walk straight past the porto-potties. You will come to another fork, do not go to the right, which leads up a slope,if you go up the slope you are going the wrong way! Anyways, hopefully that makes sense, cause the Rock Pool Rules. Going to try to go again next warm day."", 'The rock pool was so much fun but a little hard to find. The hike to century lake was really pretty and well worth it.

But....if you head up and out on the less traveler trails  the views are terrific and you find yourself mostly alone. The rock climbing is great for those of us who are not real climbers yet. The rock pools were crowded on the shores but the crisp water, climbing rocks,  and great jumps were worth maneuvering through all the watchers on the shores.

Water levels can make the trail slightly trey tepid at times but shouldn't be a problem for the experienced hiker/climber. I do this trail often, always a great time to be had, always a slightly different path. Good luck!"", ""My original idea was to do the just the  M.A.S.H. filming location hike and it was completed but with a couple detours. We started at the Grassland trailhead, headed straight to the M.A.S.H site there is a nice picnic area with shade. We hiked a little farther to see what the reagan ranch but I don't think we really knew what we where looking at.... no clear signage. Coming back we stopped by Century Dam and the Rock Pool. We turned the hike into a 11 mile venture and had an easy time adding to the trail. Also went up to another trail that went back to Mulholland highway but it was kinda lame and uneventful. Overall a B+ it was very fun outing"", 'Go the back route over the dam, much more enjoyable than going through the rock pools first.', ""Trails are not well marked in Malibu Creek State Park.

Easy 1 mi trail to the rock pool, which seems to be the main attraction. Not much of a trail, just a dirt road really. Rock Pool was so much fun! The water wasn't very cold and there were many people jumping in (including myself). I can't wait to go back!!"", 'This trail was so much fun!!!

They have camping sites so there are plenty of restrooms and trash cans.', 'The Malibu Creek is a very fun spot. Plenty of trails to hike, however the gorge was my favorite part. There are rocks to jump off of into the pool, each at a different height. There are many places people rock climb, hooks already in rocks, and natural rock walls to climb that are fun because if you slip you fall into water. I have pics posted of one of the walls you can climb. The gorge is a hangout, with plenty of people swimming, barbecuing, laying out etc. I read on the internet you can take a trail starting from the gorge all the way to the dam, locals call it ""running the gauntlet"". We tried and the trail we found was too over grown to continue. Lots of poison oak, so be careful. I got a gnarly rash from it on my legs (wear pants!!!)', ""It was a nice hike, nice park. It's definitely not an easy trail."", ""We followed the creek made it into a loop (you'll go across and rock pool and hit part of century lake), though this is definitely a very tough path if you're not very familiar with bouldering, or you're not willing to swim/wade through water.  So heading to the rock pools there is actually 2 main bouldering sections that require a decent amount of skill to get across without falling into the water. After you get past that, then there's a lot of climbing over rocks. Sometimes you'll have to go back and forth across the creek, but there is one section where you're essentially going vertical (on the right side), and another section where you'll have to use a chain that's there to help you climb up (also on the right). When you hit the dam, climb the fence and you'll be able to get onto the main trail and it's easy from there. Roughly 6 miles / 4 hours. This loop is not for inexperienced hikers, and will need at least one person familiar with bouldering. Still, it is quite an adventure and the scenery is gorgeous. FYI, park on Mulholland and save some money on parking."", 'Very pretty area. We will be back.', 'Go up to the lake and go over the dam and hike down the riverbed. Fun cross between hiking and rock climbing in parts. ', ""I just completed this hike Monday 9/9 and it was pretty awesome! The parking lot is $12 but if you park off of Mullholand it's an easy walk into where the parks located The Trail to Centuray lake is pretty easy and so worth it! We had to climb over the fences area to get down into the Rock pools but again so worth it. I caught a couple of Crawdads and saw some rattle snakes ... You just gotta keep an eye and ear out. Scenery is amazing and I'm hoping next time to venture fatter down the rock pools ... Can't wait for winter time when there is more water flow . Good luck! "", ""Just got don't with this one. park on Mulholland and save $12, the distance isn't any farther. Really nice area in all to hike around. The lake is for sure a simple and well worth it hike. The rock pool is cool, but lots of kids being kids and people drinking. Would go for the lake and then at least stop the rock pool to check it out."", ""Did this hike yesterday. Free parking on Mulholland. Went to Century lake and jumped in for a swim near the damn. Then back on the trail to the MASH site which was cool to see the 3 remaining vehicles and signage.

The views of LA and the Pacific are amazing!', 'Easy hike out to the rock pool, which, while very pretty and fun to swim in, was far too crowded with families and screaming kids.  Go during the week while school is in session.\n', 'This is by far my favorite hike that I have been on so far! Went on it twice in a row. It does cost $12 to park but I think its well worth it, especially since your going to want to make this an all day activity. Make sure to pack water and some snacks. (Maybe even a towel and something to swim in seeing as theres many places to go in the water.) The first time my friends and I went we kept getting side tracked by all the amazing things to explore. Trees that have split and re-rooted themselves, different trails to see, places where you can go down to the creek and swim, just an all around safari feel. After exploring we went to the rock rool. There were quite a few people there both times but they are usually very nice. One man said its, ""LA\'S BEST KEPT SECRET"" and I agree. Theres rocks to jump off and climb, or you can just go for a swim on a hot day and have a picnic. Theres also another spot at the begining of the trails that is good to go swimming and jump into the water.', 'This trail or park for that matter is one of my favorite in the LA area, the crowds  on

trail just behind the visitors center that will also take you to the rock pools)....then just take Craigs road to High road to get to century lake, ( there is a side trail that will take you straight

Decent feel of a natural setting in LA, which is no small feat. The walk is easy but steep. Not technical by any means but my 7-year-old would struggle with it. My teens loved it.

Hollywood.', ""An iconic L.A. hike you need to do at least once.As a hike, this trail probably only merits three stars: a short, fairly easy path up a wide track, to views you can more easily getting driving up. What really makes this fun (especially if you're with an outgoing Golden retriever) are all the people you meet from all around the world.

It is a great workout because the whole first leg up is uphill til the Observatory. On the way down, I branched off to the right at the 0.6 mark and come down that part of the trail because it is easier on my knees. If you want to make the workout a little more challenging then, turn around and head up again.. you will feel so accomplished with those 4 miles and might be inspired to head up a third time?!', ""If you're from LA or visiting LA you just have to do this trail!

I’ll admit I actually got off the path a few times, so I had to use this apps map to help me get back on course. Going down to the actual palm trees was a challenge, but it was worth it. There are many beautiful scenarios along the way so I recommend doing this hike.', 'A lovely hike but very steep small section to get into the oasis. We returned via the Mastadon loop, and there were lovely flowers and many hummingbirds. However the very end to rerun to Cottonwood Springs parking is confusing as the area was closed after flooding.', 'Great walk, lots of variety, ups and downs. It;s a bit of a clamber down the canyon at the end, but not too bad. We took our 7 and 9 yo and did the whole thing in about 4 hours. Definitely worth the hike. Views of the salton see on the way', ""My favorite hike in JTNP!  A wide variety of terrain, sweeping views, periodic animal sightings, and a huge diversity of plant life, including some unexpected desert blooms even though it's winter!  At the end point we hiked down into the oasis.  Based on a tip from hikers coming back out of the oasis, we did not descend at the Lost Palms Canyon sign.  They said it was steep and gravelly and you could get better footing by descending further to the right, walk up the oasis, then ascend via the Lost Palms Canyon path.  We followed their advice and it was a good tip.  There is no signage or markers if you descend further to the right but people have placed cairns along the way to guide you.  Having been into the oasis canyon once, I don't think I'd bother again.  For me it was anticlimactic and I preferred the view from above.  I plan to hike the entire trail again in the future, just probably won't descend into the canyon from now on."", 'The road is open again, as of 12-19-18.\nVery nice hike. Lovely vistas the whole way to the oasis.', 'Yes,  the road to the parking lot is still washed out,  but we really enjoyed this trail,  beginning from the Cottonwood Campground and starting with the upper half of the Mastodon Loop trail. Our hike was 10 miles, 4.5 hours with a lunch break at the bottom of the oasis (you have to go down into the oasis if you can do it). The was some water in the oasis,  maybe due to a bit of rain last week. The weather has been cool so we only saw a few lizards on our way back but also saw a fox and a jack rabbit closer to the campground area.', '11/21/18 This was our first hike as a couple! The road that leads into the trail is still closed. The rangers were very helpful in helping us navigate to the start of the trail. We made a few wrong turns but we were able to navigate back on the trail. The app is so helpful! Our entire hike ended up being 11 miles (lol) and took 5.25 hours. The oasis at the end did not have any water but some palm trees at the bottom of the canyon. Very cool view. Weather was perfect with a nice breeze which was welcome. If you want to save yourself a couple miles I’d suggest driving up to the camping area where there is parking near the group sites and entrance to the trail. We would definitely do this next time.', '5/5 stars, great views of the park, some cool boulders and the oasis at the end was cherry on top! Definitely worth the trek. We had to start from the campgrounds and do the loop behind the Cottonwood Springs campground due to the road being washed out. Added an extra 2 or 2.5 miles, making the hike about 4 hours total.', 'Did this hike two days ago.  Cottonwood Trail, the main trail to Lost Palms, and the road to it, are closed due to being washed out from floods.   If you want to hike to Lost Palms you can park at Campground A-B and take the trail toward Mastodon Peak.   Once you pass the gold mine and Mastodon Peak go down the hill to Lost Palms Oasis Trail and take a left.   Then it’s the Trail as normal to List Palms.    This way adds about 1.5-2 miles to the normal hike.    Great views as always.', 'Could not hike entire trail due to a closure, so hiked a loop (made via another trail) back to parking lot. Fantastic hike, beautiful vegetation.', 'lovely trail we did it in December', ""This hike offers a great desert experience, just know that there are no Joshua Trees in this part of the park. That said, the hike has some beautiful views of the desert as well as an enjoyable (if small) oasis at the end. We did the hike in early June and knowing that the temperatures would easily get to 110+, we aimed to start as early as possible. In the end, we only managed to hit the trail at around 7am but got back to the car comfortably just before noon even with a detour to the Mastodon Mine. \nThere is a sign posted close to the trail-head, which warns people that hiking out into the desert could be life-threatening this time of the year, and without bringing enough water, that is very true. We carried almost a gallon each and drank most of it by the time we got back, so if you're planning on doing this hike in summer, make sure you are well prepared and start early in the morning - there is no shadow or water anywhere along the trail. The trail itself is fairly level for most part with only a short, steep descent/ascent to/from the canyon with the palms but, in summer, the heat does make this a fairly strenuous endeavor. Overall, I would definitely recommend the hike, just know your limits and don't even think about doing it in summer without bringing lots of water!\nAs for wildlife, we saw plenty of rabbits, some antelope squirrels, a kingsnake, and a bunch of reptiles."", 'This trail was awesome even this late in the season. I hit the trail early and was back at my car by 1145. The trail rating is moderate is correct in my opinion. There are sections of climbing/bouldering at the canyon entrance and exit. You are also exposed for most of the trail with no water and very limited shade until you reach the oasis. Pictures don’t do this place justice. It was beautiful. I did submit a recording. It accidentally paused it for .7 if a mile. I also didn’t make the full loop the end of the trail so you’re looking at 7.5 miles easy round trip. Be prepared for heat, have water and enjoy! As an experienced hiker this trail  was not a waste of time. Not as challenging as some, but there is more to a hike that elevation gain etc.. absolutely beautiful and highly recommend.', ""Nice morning stroll if you are camping in cottonwood camping. Took about 3 hours, including going a bit deeper once I reached the palm trees. It's nice, and getting to oasis spring is special, it feels like you just arrived somewhere totally different with these big trees."", 'Miles 1-2.5 are moderately strenuous, upgrade out and downgrade return. Thereafter the trail becomes more challenging with steep sections, wide and narrow washes, a steep switchback down to the Oasis from the sign, and nary any shade. Definitely doable in dry weather. Mind the previous comments about distance, heat, and bringing plenty of water. The scenery is awesome.', 'Few things in my opinion - ""wind in the desert can be a bonus"", meaning it can make it a cooler hike, and helpful (gusts to 20 mph are just fine)l. This hike is 9  miles RT - about 2.5 miles of this hike are a bit boring admittedly, but the rest is quite scenic. The steep ""sketchy trail"" at Lost Palms area is a challenge - There are maybe 30 Fan Palms down there in the steep canyon. Finding and negotiating the small loop down in the steep canyon is vague, and requires moderate bouldering skills, and maybe a GPS. More than 20-30% of folks wont\'t be able to do the short loop at Lost Palms, though this should not deter one from going down there if you can make it. It is steep coming back up from Lost Palms  as well. Make sure to take enough water (you will be sorry if you don\'t - respect the desert). Lastly, do hike Mastedon Peak near the trail head, it\'s one of the two main highlights of the hike, an should not be missed.', 'Overhyped? Uninteresting? Wow. Some people just don’t open their eyes.  Don’t listen to naysayers. This hike is a gem.', 'Best trail in the park! The Palm trees are huge. Be sure to venture down in to the canyon to get a closer look. The scenery a long the trail to get there is pretty amazing also! Love those rock formations and all the different cacti!', ""Honestly, the reviews on this trail are a bit overhyped. It's a fairly boring 3.5mi walk out to a canyon where a few cool-looking palm trees reside. If you're an experienced hiker looking for a challenge, this will not be at all fullfilling."", 'Overall not an interesting hike. The views are pretty, you can see the Salton Sea from a distance but the palm trees at the end were not worth it. Also not a difficult hike, it’s very flat, just long. Visit the palm trees at the front and then go explore the rest of the park. Don’t waste your time!', 'Great views with interesting rocky hills. Go early to avoid the crowds.', 'Such a beautiful hike. Not to difficult! Finished in 3 hours and 25 minutes!', '', 'One of my favorite hikes in Joshua Tree. Lots of cool vegetation and rock formations, and the oasis is a great place to break for a lunch below the palms. The view between the mountains approaching the oasis is great, as are the views on almost the entire return hike, where the San Jacinto mountains and Salton Sea can be seen. Either on the way there or the way back make sure to stop by Mastodon Peak for some amazing views. The path up to the very top is just a bunch of boulders that need to be scrambled over, but it isn’t very challenging and is very much worth it.', 'The oasis is NOT anticlimactic. It’s absolutely beautiful seeing and (surprisingly) smelling a hidden grove of giant palms in the middle of the montane desert. Fed by an underground spring, the trees have an incredibly sweet, woody smell.', ""Nice hike for getting a feel for the environment of Joshua Tree - spiky plants, rolling desert hills and rocky features, maybe a few critters. The oasis itself is neat but not spectacular, fun to climb down to. The climb into the oasis is really the only tricky part terrain-wise, all the rest is slightly hilly trail but not too steep.Did in Feb. 2018 and the weather was in the high 70's the whole morning. Took 3-4 hours, a feasible way to spend a morning or an afternoon."", 'This was a moderate hike for me, we took the mastodon rock loop to start so it ended up over 8 miles total. Was nice and scenic though the oasis at the end a little anticlimactic.', 'Lots and lots of water is recommended and sun screen', 'Nice hike through a part of the desert with very diverse Fauna. There is always something to see. The Oasis is not spectacular but worth seeing. I fully recommend this trail.', 'Amazing hike with lots to see in the middle of a dessert!!! The hike was more beautiful than the destination (the lost palm oasis). Bring lots of water and snacks ', 'Awesome. The trail is very well marked and easy to find. It starts with about 2 miles of easy, rolling, sand-like paths. The final part of the trail is great- amazing views and fun passages through canyons, etc. Make sure to bring water and sun protection!!!', 'Hiked on Sunday, 2/18/18. Great hike in and out. Trail down to the palms was a little sketchy. Fantastic weather. Sunny but cool. Well worth the hike.', 'beautiful winter hike', 'This trail had all the feels. Wildflowers, views, birds...Somewhat strenuous due to the length and rolling hills. But absolutely worth it to go the extra distance down to the Palms. The sandy wash passes are beautiful and contain so many colorful rocks.', 'Amazing great hike,', 'Great hike', 'I can’t really improve upon what’s already been written other than to reinforce what a lovely hike this is! It’s beautiful the entire way... lotsa changes in scenery. Outstanding views in all directions. There’s plenty of nice rock formations along the way to pull off the trail to rest/lunch/just hang out and soak it all up. You can include mastodon peak on the way back which makes for a great sunset location.', 'Favorite hike in Joshua Tree', 'Easy trail to follow. The Oasis is large and dry, but has very little space to sit and take a break before heading back. There are steep sections and parts that are a sandy wash which make the hike a little more difficult.', 'Gorgeous views in every direction. Moderate until you get to the Oasis there is a steep trail with loose gravel down to the Palms and would not  recommend for beginners. Walked past the Oasis to the 4 mile mark but after that there is a steep drop off. The trail is fully exposed and Hot even in December so bring lots of water, sunscreen, hat and sunglasses.', 'Went in early November. Overall enjoyable. Very interesting rock formations and plants along the way. I was very happy to see the salton sea. No water in the oasis, still worth it to see the beautiful palm trees. Not a strenuous hike, good mix of uphill and downhill. Temperature got very hot even in November with no shade. Not a lot of signs, we got lost on our way back, and eventually found the trail again. Bring sun protection and lots of water.', 'Great walk in the park. Not as strenuous as people made out to be.', 'Deceptively long trail. Lots of false ends. That being said, it’s a beautiful and varied terrain. Make sure to do Mastodon Peak on the way if you have time! Only 1.4 miles extra round trip.', 'Beautiful the whole way with boulders and flora. Gentle incline until the end where it gets steep. Somewhat peopled, but not crowded. Views much of the way. I enjoyed this hike more than I thought I would.', 'Fall 2016 with Marie and friends', 'Absolutely gorgeous oasis! Must do! Did it in a few hours!', 'Well marked trail with a great varied terrain.  Gentle ups and downs the entire distance with a few steep ascents and descents. Toughest portion is the canyon where the palms are. Rugged and steep (approx 500 ft).One rattle snake encounter.  Be aware- it was hiding right along the trail just up under one of the low scrub bushes.Weather was fantastic. Nice breeze and clear view of Salton Sea.', 'Varied terrain on a well marked trail.  Oasis is fantastic.  A ""Land of the Lost"" feeling after a few miles through the desert.', 'Good times for sure.', ""I enjoyed this hike.  The views were nice and there was abundant small wildlife.  I started at about 6am to try and beat the heat.  The trail is well maintained, with erosion control on some of the steeper parts.  There are occasional blazes to help you navigate when the trail crosses or runs along a wash.  There are mile markers every mile.  \n\nRound trip took me about 3.5 hours.  I spent about an hour at the canyon/oasis.  I was traveling alone, and tend to move quickly.  You might need more time.  The trail was mostly empty on this Saturday morning in July.   I only saw one couple out there besides me.    \n\nThe descent/ascent into the canyon at the end is a loop.  The west side is a scramble over boulders.  The way through the boulders is marked with stacked rocks.  The east side is a steeper trail.  Just walk straight towards the sign about the palm trees, and you'll see it.  I preferred to descend on the west (boulder) side, and walk up the eastern side.  \n\nYou can also continue southeast through the canyon to an old mine.  Follow the bits and pieces of water pipes.  There wasn't much at the end, so you could probably skip this part unless you just want to extend your walk.\n\nYou'll exposed to the sun for most of this hike, so be prepared properly especially if you are doing this mid-day in the summer.  I drank about 3L of water for my morning hike."", ""Awesome trail. Great scenery and lots of wildlife. No one was out there however it did reach temps of 100+ but that's expected in June. Bring lots of water and a cooling towel came in handy. Make sure to pay attention, easy to come off the trail in some parts."", 'Great hike! Every section is interesting. The hike down into the canyon at the palm trees is a little steep. No too much traffic.', 'A very beautiful trail. Lots of up and down but nice trail.  Bring lots of water.', 'had a blast with my girlfriend. heat was the biggest obstacle', 'Excellent desert hike to a shady oasis', ""Amazing trail! I think I enjoyed this more than Anza Borrego during the bloom! So many different flowers, cactuses, and animals too! Feels like a totally different planet. I could not recommend this hike more!Also, watch out for rattle snakes! Saw one on the trail and had to wait for it to pass under a rock to get through. It didn't rattle at me though, so be careful out there!"", 'Really awesome hike. While it is roughly 8 miles (out/back 4 miles each way) it is somewhat flat with very mild inclines along the way. The last half mile or so it a bit more strenuous but the descent into the valley is very beautiful. You just need to be mindful of your footing. The spring time is a beautiful time to go with the wildflowers blooming and lots of critters along the trail.', 'Cool to see palm trees in the middle of nowhere', ""One of the better long hikes in JT. The geography was varied which made the hike more interesting.  Beautiful views along the way.  The wildflowers are beautiful right now. The last half mile at the end has the potential to be a little treacherous for less experienced hikers who are not so sure footed. But don't worry- you'll make it and be glad you did.    The Salton Sea was visible from the end of the trail.  Great spot to sit, take in the views and refuel for the walk back."", 'I enjoyed this hike a lot.  The wildflowers were blooming and the hike took about 3.5 hours.  Make sure you go down into the canyon to see the palms.', ""A must see for the quintessential Joshua Tree experience.  The trail is well marked but very exposed. So, bring plenty of hydration (water, electrolytes) and sun protection (hat, umbrella would be nice too).  I hiked this in late Winter and temps still hit 90.  The trail has three small passes that offer stunning views of Mt. San Jacinto and the Salton Sea.  The end of the trail has a pretty steep descent into the Lost Palms Oasis.  Take your time and you'll do just fine.  Camp at the Cottonwood campgrounds if you can.  The night skies are just as beautiful as the Joshua Tree landscape.\n\nBelow is a short video of my camp at Cottonwood and the hike to Lost Palms Oasis:\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/208777951"", ""Really nice hike. Make sure to go down into the Lost Palms Canyon if you are able. It's not challenging to descend into the canyon, but does require some minor use of your hands on the way down. We are 30 and in relatively good shape and it took us about 3.5 hours, including a nice break in the canyon."", 'After the rainy last few months it is really green. The ocatillos are beautiful.', 'Really nice hike add Mastodon Peak on the way out for a great day.', 'This trail is in the south end of the park by the Cottonwood Visitor Center. It starts with a short walk through the Cottonwood Palms Oasis near the site of an old mine, which is now contaminated with heavy metals and has been roped off. \n\nThere is a second oasis, the Lost Palm Oasis, at the end of the trail. Hikers can descend into Lost Palms Canyon but it is a rather rigorous hike out.\n\nAbout halfway to the Lost Palm Oasis is a side trail that leads to the Mastodon Peak loop. This is generally considered to be a moderate hike, but could be more challenging for the person who is not in peak form.\n\nIn spite of the contaminated entrance and even without the sidebar to Mastodon Peak, the trail up to Lost Palms offers a beautiful walk – a different slice at a ‘wonderland of rocks.’ Plenty of diverse plants, birds. I consider it to be one of the best hikes in the park.\n\nSince the ride from the north to the south end of the park can take an hour one way, I recommend travelers plan to do the Lost Palm Oasis and Mastodon Peak in the morning and stop at the Cholla Cactus Garden on the way back to the north end of the park, timing arrival for sunset, when the plants look as though they are lighted from within by the setting sun.', ""This was a great hike to the largest concentration of California fan palm trees in the park.  We went in December, during a period of unprecedented levels of visitation, but this hike was not crowded.  The beginning of the trail is shared with another hike, so that period had more people, but overall this is a great one for seclusion and to immerse yourself in desert scenery.There is a vault toilet at the start, but this trail is close to both Cottonwood campground as well as the south ranger station.  There is drinking water there to stock up, if needed.  As others have mentioned, there is little shade on this trail, so water is vital.The trail is relatively well marked, although the sand made it a little difficult at times.  There is also some steep rock navigation that'll be required near the oasis itself especially as you descend into the canyon.  We had brought hiking poles and were very glad we did.  At the oasis there is shade, plenty of resting spots, standing water, and a large bird population.  We weren't fortunate enough to see many other animals, but other people were.  We timed this hike to have sunset on the way back for pictures.  It was gorgeous.  Those who do this definitely need warm clothing and lights as the temperature drops quickly when the sun sets."", 'No big boulders around on this trail but still stunning Colorado Desert scenery. I agree that the miles posted are somewhat misleading: from the parking area and doing the Mastodon Mine loop (which is a bit strenuous but worth it), I clocked in at 11 miles-plus round trip. There are a few steep but short climbs. The palm groves and oasis are full of overgrown brush, wild yet charming. GREAT views of the Salton Sea on stark clear days.', ""Very nice trail, but longer than indicated. At the trail head it said 3mi (appr. 4.5km) to the oasis but this app recorded 6.5km and we didn't even finish the loop at the end, so back and forth this was 13km or even more if you complete the loop around the oasis. Be prepared for the heat and start in the morning, there is no shade at all and bring enough water and snacks."", 'Oasis is pretty cool, but be careful doing this trail in the summer, almost no shade along the way.  I was very underprepared for this hike.  I was ready for it to be over long before I was back in the car.', 'This is a great trail! Not difficult at all, the ups and downs are short hills, and very easy to manage. The trail is well maintained and easy to follow with the exception of a couple areas where the trail intersects with some washes... But if you pay attention, they are all marked which way to go.\n\nThe Oasis is cool, but I expected to see actual water there. There is no water to be found at all. there is green and trees, but no water. Do not expect to be able to filter water at this location at this time of year.\n\nWe camped on the hill above the oasis, it was great. Awesome star gazing!', 'Super fun easy hike with amazing sights!', 'Amazing hike in spring season . Bouldering was my favorite...hard leg workout but fun. Need to go back', 'Great', 'We hiked this trail on March 13 2016.  The wildflowers on coming out. The scenery is great. There is a loop as you hike down into the oasis. The trail down going clockwise ( at the sign) is not all that easy but doable.  Then keep going thru the oasis until you reach a trail going up thru  a rock cut. That part of the trail is not easy but it is not too long, Just follow the small carins, Then they disappear and just keep going up. Great day.', ""Beautiful hike. Add in mastadon peak and you'll have a good hike"", 'Great hike. Once you see the palms you know it was worth it. It is a long hike and there are a lot of ups and downs. The last bit is a pretty steep hike in to a canyon that was interesting getting back up.', 'Lots of up and down with good scenery and even a couple spots of shade of you go early in the morning. A friend and I arrived at about 10 PM on a Friday and hiked out a mile and a half before setting up our tent. The stars at night in the park are absolutely amazing.  If you have the opportunity to do some backcountry camping in the park I would definitely recommend it. We started for the oasis just before sunrise the next morning and were able to get a lot of changing views as the sun came up over the mountains. Once we got to the oasis we kept going along the bottom of the canyon for another couple miles. Here the trail gets very thick with boulders and can be difficult if you have a heavy pack like we did.', ""This is essentially a long walk to the top of a steeper canyon where the work begins. But it is worth the effort to go down and find this oasis of palms in the middle of nothing. Very worthwhile hike.\n\nSurprised to see this trail rated as difficult as my wife and I did it with a group in 2013 and most of us were in our 60's. However, the length of it does mean you'll be hoofing it back across the desert in the heat of the day so ability to deal with heat (bring lots of water and drink it!) is important."", 'Lost Palms Oasis is the longest listed day hike (7.1 miles) in Joshua Tree National Park, taking you from one palm oasis to another, only 9 miles from I-10.

The oasis feels like such a treat after the trek out in the heat, though it is pretty easy to moderate with slowly slopping hills and valleys. You go through washes, across rocks, through cacti groves and reach a lot of different views. Bring enough water, and if you feel up for it, going down into the canyon to sit under the trees of the oasis is great for a lunch, but remember you have to come out, and it can be a little rough hiking back up from the bottom.', 'Note- This is an out and back, not loop trail (if it matters)\n\nThis is a nice hike; we went in late Feb.  and some wildflowers were just starting.  The hike is mostly on decomposed granite pebbles with a few rocky spots.  Overall, some up and down, but not much climbing.

It has a very beautiful view of Salton sea and the coachella valley. I would not recommend this hike for young children', ""This is an awesome hike for serious trail blazers. This trail ends in a grove of Palm Trees located in a remote valley in the Joshua Tree National Park. The grove of Palms dates back to the 1900's and survived a fire in the early '80's. Fire damage can still be seen on some of the palms. This trail gets to high elevations and you can tell the air is thinner. At the end of the trail, in the grove of palms, it has a beautiful oasis and is a great place to picnic. The trail is hard and difficult.

If you take the fork to the right it will be a steep and rocky incline that meets up with the access road so either path will keep you headed in the right direction.

Had to park in the Discovery Center parking lot as the Cougar Crest lot was full. Hiked with my kid. The last 1/2 mile to Bertha Peak is real steep but doable. Just take a few breaks if you need it. Views along the Cougar crest, PCT and Bertha are amazing. Took us 4.5 hours round trip which included a 30 minute break at the summit towers/buildings. Kinda rocky in spots but pretty much dirt trails and the dirt access road to the summit. I would rate this as a moderate 6.5 mile hike.', 'My daughter and I hiked up to Bertha this morning!  Good trail, pretty easily marked, and a steady climb.  I suggest one goes early in the morning.  Less people and cooler temperatures!', 'Very nice trail. Keep a fast pace to get a decent workout. Dog friendly, my Aussie was off leash most of the way. On leash when we came about other dogs on leash.', ""We have always loved hiking up to the PCT via the Cougar Crest trail. Today we went a bit further and took the PCT about a1/2 mile (south?) before turning right at the metal post which indicates the Bertha's Peak Trail. (the letters are so faded, don't count on being able to read it!) There is no mistaking the upwards hill that takes you on the BP trail, though! There is a straight up hill covered in white rocks. Yup! That's it! It felt like getting to the BP trail was fairly easy, especially because we got there early before the sun could bake us, but once you start the upwards rocky road to BP, it gets a bit more challenging. It's the perfect amount of challenge though. It's a little demanding while you're doing it, but you know you can do it, and then you're super glad you did do it. I have always enjoyed the views of Big Bear Lake from the Cougar Crest trail...but I gotta say...the views from the PCT and from Bertha's Peak are superior, making that challenge at the end very rewarding! What a great day to be outdoors!"", 'Hiked this with my family all the way to the top! It was amazing! A little long for my 9 month old but she was a trooper and did great in the carrier! Definitely doing this again!', 'Great trail for beginners and children. The trail is well maintained with a few benches a long the path, and is easy enough that our toddler navigated it just fine!', 'I loved it. Bring water and snacks', ""I hiked this trail back in 2015 and took it to the top by the towers.  The trail is beautiful and gives you a great view of Big Bear Lake.  The last part when you are close to the towers goes straight up an access dirt road.  When heading back down make sure not to miss the turn off for the trail.  It is easy to miss and you will end up down the mountain miles from the trailhead.  This last Memorial Weekend we headed towards this trail again, but didn't have enough time to do the whole trail.  Even though we didn't have enough time it still did not disappoint.  With only a short distance up you get a magical view of the lake.  This trail is also tucked away on the back side of Big Bear lake making the trail not as crowded as the trails closer to the Village.  Read more about our last trip on my blog\nhttps://lovz2hike.com/2017/06/10/fishing-with-coyotes-and-hiking-cougar-crest-trail-big-bear/\n\nHappy Hiking :)"", 'Great hike.', 'incredible views, beautiful. fairly  easy hike', 'As per previous reviews, the last 1/4 mile is a the kicker.  \nVery beautiful views of the lake all along this hike.', ""This is an amazing hike! It's quite long (took me a little over 4 hours to do), but the view is well worth it."", ""If you're trekking from the more mild Cougar Crest Trail, Bertha throws in an final, surprisingly intense, leg  burn just before spilling you out on top of a nice vista .  Forge the few extra steps up to the electrical station (?). We were able to grab a rest and some nice shots!"", 'Nice.', 'Nice hike beautiful scenery but look out for the mountain bikes. We were nearly taken out by a group coming around the bend at top speed', ""not a bad hike overall. 7 miles in and out. trail is dusty and somewhat rocky through certain areas. the last section is the steepest and most rocky. when we got near the peak, there were a crew of tree trimmers around the power station. so we weren't able to see the absolute top of the peak. kinda of a bummer."", 'The peak has generators and power lines on top and the last .08 miles is very steep and dusty. The view is just as good from the top of Cougar Crest Trail. Had I known, I would have skipped the last bit up the PCT and on to Bertha Peak.', 'Hiked up to the peak with my boyfriend on Sunday morning. Hard for me, but made it to the top. Nice views, resting spots.', 'Great experience. You start at Cougar Crest and up thru the PCT. great panoramic view of the lake. Last  3/4 of a mile is steep with loose rock.', 'Great workout. Nice and quiet. Awesome views.', ""This was a fun hike that took about 4.5 hours including a break a the peak. The trails were easy to follow from the Cougar Crest Trail up to the Pacific Crest Trail and up to Berthas Peak. The majority of the trail was pretty easy, but rocky and the last 3/4 of a mile to the peak becomes pretty steep and rocky. Overall, the weather was great, the trail was fun and we couldn't have asked for a better day."", 'Pretty long for us but worth it', 'Saw deer! Took my dog and teenager, it was quite easy for all', 'Nice trail! Took off from Cougar Crest. Bring lots of water and make sure to wear good boots.', 'Nice little out and back with some friends. Affords nice views of big bear stating half way up. The last mile can be fairly strenuous so be prepared.', 'One of my favorite hikes in Socal. Incredible views and not too busy.', 'We began at the Cougar Crest trailhead at the Discovery Science Center which at the beginning, was a paved trail.  The trail turned to dirt and was easy most the way up. Our goal was to reach Bertha Peak.  The last part of the trail berfore you reach Bertha Peak is pretty steep.  The radio tower at the top is sort of a let down but the panoramic views of Big Bear Lake and Holcomb Valley are unreal.  Overall, it was a pretty easy trail and a nice day hike escape from the city.', 'Pretty easy hike. Nice, wide trail. Very clean and quiet. I brought my 9 year with me, and he endured just fine.', 'My favorite trail so far. Great view.', 'I love this hike. Enough elevation for a workout - but do-able. Fantastic views of the lake and surrounding mountains. And fun for the dog. Beautiful.', 'Great trail. Rocky at times but overall fairly maintained. Pretty Moderate for the first 2 miles, the it gets pretty steep once you turn right to jump on the OHV trail to get to Bertha Peak. Views are definitely worth the hike, be sure to check out the back side of the mountain.', 'Beautiful, easy afternoon hike. Go there and watch the sunset. Icy/ muddy in the winter, wear hiking boots to avoid slipping.', ""Very beautiful trail, almost always a scenic view! Steady climb up most of the mountain. However the original posting is a bit deceptive when it says this is cougar crest trail (leading up to Bertha Peak). Cougar crest ends about a mile before the trek the Bertha peak. The trek from the end of CC to Bertha Peak is quite steep, but so rewarding when you get to the top. Also I wouldn't say you need to go to Bertha Peak to get all the views you can pretty much see them throughout the hike. Lots of friendly people and benches to rest along the away. It was a day's hike but very beautiful!"", 'Fantastic trail, good climb lots to see and great even in mid February.  Moderate difficulty', 'Very nice trail. You can go on the PCT for a few miles and hike back to Big Bear via the van Dusen Canyon Road.', ""Beautiful trail. It's a bit rocky in some places but worth the hike. When I made it to the top most of the trees were covered in icicles which meant it was frigid, but pretty. Will definitely be hiking this trail again in the spring~"", 'Nice trail. A little rocky, so good shoes are important. Bertha Peak was pretty steep.', 'Nice day hike with pretty views of Big Bear Lake and a chance to hit the PCT too.', 'Trail is beautiful, amazing nature, very silent. Although was disappointed with the peak itself. Has couple of fenced buildings on it. Feeling of ""reaching it"" unfortunately left me at that point :(', 'Nice tracks.', 'Nice shades areas! Nice views of Big Bear Lake!', 'Cougar crest is a great trail with terrific views.  Once you connect with the PCT at the top of Cougar Crest - you will hike to a jeep road for the ascent to the peak.  A great hike all around.  Views were actually more spectacular from the CC and PCT vs at the Peak.', ""Great trail!... First time hikers be prepared for a long hike. Fairly easy. Only hard part is the last part climbing Bertha's Peak. Very steep at times. Take your time with this one. We did it Round trip in 3 1/2 hrs.  Take lots of water."", 'Very rocky trails. We hoped to run this trail but mostly had to walk due to the jagged rocks.Fun, nonetheless!', ""The view of Big Bear Lake is quite impressive from the top of  Bertha Peak.  The trail is hard and rocky in a lot of places; my dog (who is 12) refuses to do it anymore, probably because of the pounding her feet take.  The trail up is moderate except a bit steeper toward the top.  Most of the trail is a pleasant walk through the woods (in other words, boring if you do a lot of hiking), but there are nice views on the way up.  The area around the three benches toward the top of Cougar Crest Trail (before you go over the saddle to the back side) are a peaceful place to stop if you're not going all the way up.   Past the saddle, and from the top of Bertha, you can see down into historic Holcomb Valley, where the town of Belleville used to be when there was gold there."", 'Great weather, fresh air, steep at times but nothing unbearable. Great panoramic view of the entire lake valley at the top, and got to see the PCT, pretty cool overall!', 'Beautiful views of the lake make this a rewarding hike!', 'Great views along the way to the top! The hike is decently steep incline the majority of the trek, but nothing too intimidating...', 'Great hike for kids', ""This was a great hike! We took a 13 and 9 year old and had a great time. Easy hike with moderate elevation climb. Beautiful views! Couldn't ask for a better hike."", 'The weather was perfect at 64 degrees and starting out as 40. Great day!!', ""This trail is simply beautiful. It's a nice leisurely hike with a gradual elevation gain, until you reach the climb for Bertha Peak. The climb gets your heart rate up, but isn't too difficult. The view at the top is amazing and well worth the effort. The trail is light to moderately traveled and very clean. It took about 3 hours round trip."", ""Great hike with breath taking views! The Cougar Crest Trail itself is an easy climb in elevation (we didn't feel out of breath at all). It was a wonderful feeling to connect with the Pacific Crest Trail and walk on the famous trail for a bit. It was when we got to the sign for Bertha Peak that the work began! Quite the quick rise in elevation, but so worth it. Gorgeous views of Big Bear Lake and the ski areas. The trail info here shows that this is a 6.2 mile hike, but when we clocked it with our hike tracker we showed 7.6 miles... All in all a great hike that rewards the hiker with amazing scenery."", ""Nice hike.  More than 90% of the trail snow covered, and last, steeper portion (on the road off the PCT) had ankle deep snow, making for a tough but rewarding slog up.  The hike was marred by folks with off-leash dogs that ran up and harassed my leashed dog.  This is the second time it's happened on this trail.  PLEASE keep your dogs leashed."", 'This trail is part of the PCT…need I say more. Of course it has that rugged Alpine feel as you climb and twist up the canyons to the crest. The views are outstanding. To get to BerthA Peak you need to take a fire road up. That is the biggest challenge and quite steep. After huffing and puffing to the top I saw a couple with their two Children 5&7y at the crest. Good Job!! Im impressed!\nLast year and last time I did this trail I saw the largest Timber Rattler in my life! Today a saw a small child running blindly through the woods…..what ARE your PARENTS THINKING or are they?..thinking??', 'Nice easy going hike. Make sure to get an Adventure Pass or start from the Big Bear Discovery Center free of charge (only 0.6 mi away). Supposedly a well-used trail, we only ran into a couple hikers on our way down. Pretty view of the lake from the top. The incline is pretty gradual, but gets steep at times. Lots of rocks! Reduced our trail running quite a bit. Good easy-moderate hike!', 'Camped in bear with my buddy for two nights in June 2013 and tackled this trail first. Great hike for anyone! Nothing strenuous on this hike, good for a warm up. The Cougar Crest connects to the Pacific Crest which is pretty cool because that trail goes from Mexico all the way up through the U.S. and into Canada. Make sure to look for signs and continue to Bertha peak there are incredible views of Bear lake and Snow Summit and Bear resorts.', 'Completed this with 4 friends on 2/15. The views of the snow on bear mountain were pretty! No snow anywhere else, dry as a bone. Pretty easy but we stopped before the trail went behind the mountain. Gorgeous trees! ', 'Fun simple trail.   Did it with a group of five several years ago.  Bertha Peak was our highlight.', ""Bagged Bertha in the winter of 2011.  Loved this hike  with great views of the Lake. I think what made this hike so exciting was that it had a lot of snow on trail. Wasn't a whole lot of people on the trail but there was a few at the top. The last 500 ft or so was kind of tuff but over all it wasn't bad.

The trail doesn’t get too crowded which was great, but there are enough people around so you won’t get lost if you happen to go alone like I did. Got there close to 8am and the parking lot still had plenty of space. Signs are pretty visible once you see the starting path. Man! That first climb to the first bench. PHEW! I was beat. Total time for me to get to the Jones Peak was about 2 hrs with breaks. It wasn’t a clear day but the view was amazing nonetheless. Take your time.

Wilson Trail and back to the town of Sierra Madre.', 'This has a fantastic view and perfect for a one-day workout', ""Hiked during 95 Degree weather and oh boy was it hot. Saw about a thousand lizards on my way up. No snakes. When I reached the summit, there is a bench with fields of plants.

Stay safe', 'I don’t know why this trail is so highly rated. The waterfall (if you can call it that) is a mere trickle. This section of the trail (to the waterfall) is overgrown and poorly maintained. About a mile up the main trail, there are a couple benches with some lovely views of the city. But the rest of the hike is a real calf-buster—a brutal ascent with switchbacks that never seem to end. Unless you’re just in it for a good workout, I’d skip this one. There are no trees, no shade on this trail. I hiked it in the summertime, and it was almost unbearable.The peak does have some great views. But so does nearby Echo Mountain, and that trail has an interesting end point with resort and railroad ruins. If you’d like a good workout on a trail that is easily accessible, I’d recommend Echo Mountain over this.', 'Pretty easy hike with the exception of a short steep climb toward the peak.

Be sure your boots/shoes are as tight as possible...I wear tactical boots and my feet were a little torn up from the incline.  With that said, this is an extremely beautiful hike, saturated with wildlife -- most of it is like walking through a forest.

There are a ton of other trails to hook up with at the top, which can easily extend your hike another several miles/hours.', 'Breathtaking Views', 'It gets harder as you get to the peak. Very cool trail. Its enough exercise for me!', 'Amazing trail but be prepared if ur not in shape can get difficult as you get to the top.', 'Not recommended for a hot day.

I think most should be able to do it if you take your time. It only took me a hour and a half to make it to the peak with a few water/picture breaks. But, I do a decent amount of hiking so I'm not the average person. Coming down was a lot quicker. Don't forget the sun screen. There are a few shaded spots, but they are far a few in between."", ""Best workout for the distance.  Just put your head down and keep walking. Challenging but lovely. If you're feeling motivated to do more distance when you get to Jones Peak you can take the saddle over to the Mt. Wilson Trail where you come out just south of orchard camp. About 9-10 miles round trip."", ""Although we only made it back the falls, and despite there being only a trickle of water, this trail provided a much needed stroll through our local woods. Fellow hikers were friendly, the air was fresh and crisp and the bird songs were enchanting. There is a small nature trail across from the bridge; we had fun reading and learning about the foothills' plant life. Picnic tables and live-edge wood benches can be found near the parking lot. Although the parking lot is on the smaller side it is gated; the area is posted as open from sunrise to sunset."", ""This is a very steep hike with excellent views of the city.

Lots of sun, but a good workout.', 'Chill not a lot of people', 'It a all up hill did 3 miles but we ran out of time. Had to start coming down. Make sure when coming you bring lots of water and make sure your mouth is close or inhale with ur noise because their are lots of bugs. I swallow one or two. It was a great workout next time we plan of coming our goal is to make it all the way to the top and plenty of time to do so. Took us 2 hours doing 6 miles up and down.', 'We combined two trails: the Bailey Canyon Trail and the Mount Wilson Trail. The Bailey Canyon Trail was a good hike with some significant elevation change. When we reached the end of the Bailey Canyon trail on this map, we continued north and followed the connection to the Mount Wilson trail. Bailey Canyon is steep going up, so we were happy to climb that portion. Mount Wilson is less steep, so we were happy to go down that portion. We loved hearing the water and seeing all the green on the Mount Wilson trail, too.', ""Trailhead is easy to find and the trail is very well maintained.  Once you go past the picnic/bbq area on the left side of the parking lot, you will find a gate to go through.  Go through the metal bars and you will end up on a road to the trail.  The total gain to Jones Peak is over 2,000 ft so there is a good amount of climbing to this hike, but the trail is not really rugged and the climb is actually not too bad until the last mile or so.  I wouldn't recommend this hike to children since the trail is quite narrow and it is probably too strenuous for young kids...unless of course your child loves the challenge and work out.  But considering my 4 year old shiba inu was able to do it I'm sure it's possible for anyone to do!  There is very little shade so it's probably better to start really early since it does get quite hot!  Definitely not a hike during the summer time.  Extra water is a good idea.  Lots of switchbacks, lots of bugs and LOTS of lizards.  We went on a somewhat hazy day so the scenery was actually not too fantastic....but the flowers were beautiful.  The last mile or so and the final climb to the peak (the alltrails end point is actually before the climb to the peak) is quite steep.  There is a bench at the peak where you can enjoy the view and have a small break/lunch.  There is another canyon you can climb behind this peak, which is actually higher with a steep ascend.  At the point where the alltrails track ends, you reach Jones Peak if you climb up the hill to the right.  If you go to the left, it lead you to the higher canyon.  I did see one person climbing that canyon and the view is probably even more amazing!  But after climbing more than 2,000 ft, it's really up to you how much more you want to climb.  The view from Jones Peak is a city view. There is definitely less people than Echo Mountain so there is more solitude!  Enough people to feel safe though.\n\nOverall, great hike.  Take it slow and it should be fine.  The views are definitely not as breathtaking as the hikes on the other side of the San Gabriel Wilderness but is good enough for a hike close to Los Angeles."", 'Solid work out. Two much zigzag though', ""Nice, steady 4 mile climb. Terrain doesn't change very much but great views."", ""Good solid workout hike. Trail is well maintained. Upper parts of the trail have rocks. This trail gives sweeping views of the city below and the Catalina islands can be seen on a clearer day. I wouldn't want to do this straight uphill hike in the summer months."", ""Nice hike if you're reasonably fit. I would rate it moderately strenuous. One person in our  party was not a hiker and appeared to struggle with the incline. Nice view at the top."", 'Hiked on a spring day w a slight drizzle. Good variety of wild flowers to keep my mind off the steep incline. Definitely one of the better trails. Not sure I would enjoy it during the height of LA summers.', 'There are three trails that I found. One goes to the waterless waterfall about 1/4 of a mile in. The one to the right, which I took, goes a very steep decent up to Jones Peak. The incline was pretty intense so I only went up 3.5 miles and turned around. Steep incline makes for steep decline, killer on the knees and ankles. The 3rd trail says it is a nature walk so I will save that one for another day. Parking in good and there is a restroom.', 'I went to the trail with a meet up group, the hike up was  a little difficult at first but half way up and seeing the view I was determined to get to the top. Once there is was so peaceful and worth getting to the top.', 'Bailey Canyon was a beautiful hike 3 years ago when the waterfall was lush, I was fortunate to experience this natural beauty before the drought. It sad to see the facts 43 years ago predicted about the ozone layer destruction because of the pollution. Now the Seasons are no longer 4 season in California, but nature is confused with sudden unusual heat waves in Winter and no rain, the birds try to peck and fooled trees that are trying to sprout fruit buds. \nWhat has the carelessness of man done to poor mother earth? \nIt was sad to hike and then find what was once a humid lush waterfall, dry barren and shedding nothing but sandy soil. \nA uplifting part, which was nice to end the hike was that we took the nature trail walk for the first time and found some lush green meadows where  some huge trees had swings rigged up by some thoughtful hiker. They left some strong good rope and fashioned swings. They are is a perfect spot. Lots of bushy tailed squirrels too!\nPray for rain!', 'This is a wonderful hike above Sierra Madre with some great views of the city.  Less known than the mount Wilson trail thus more peaceful. Steep in a few places yet primarily on a narrow trail with switch backs at times. Fine for older kids yet it will be a bit long for them in reaching the top. Yes there are some areas with steeper drop offs from the trail yet I believe pretty safe for kids. If you just want a short hike after 15 minutes there is a spot with a great bench to sit on and look out over the town and distant city. Bring plenty of water and snacks as it is a vigorous hike to the top from which the view is great although the peak is barren with dirt and shrubs. One of my favorite hikes in the San Grabiels', ""We did this trail to Jones peak and follow through up the ridge to connect with the old mount Wilson trail then back on July 7, 2013 as training for Half Dome. Starting at ~ 6:30 am helped with the ascent but by mid morning the trail was an exposed heat sink for the fastest hikers coming down. The ridge past Jones peak is long and steep, so pace yourself up to Jones peak  and don't try sprinting up the last 100 yds to the top of the peak or you will pay a price when ascending the ridge up to the toll road. Unless you are planning on doing a Special Forces mission and want to to push it to the red line, I would recommend doing this  hike as described to the old mt Wilson trail during the late fall, winter or early spring. During the summer the heat index is a real challenge and 4 liters of H2O is a minimum."", 'Great 3+ hour hike for anyone wanting a workout with the payoff of staggering views.Switchbacks on the narrow trail will take you up 2000 feet thru lovely foliage and overlooks. It was quite foggy today, and when we finally made it to the top there was no view to be had, but the entire way up was lovely. Bring plenty of water.', ""I found this hike to be pretty difficult. The first set of switch backs are no joke. They're almost discouraging having one after another of steep inclines. And the trail is pretty narrow with steep drop offs. After the second vista it gets noticeably easier. It really gave my out of shape butt a serious workout. I made it to the third vista before running low on water and my shirt fully soaked through. I will attempt jones peak when my skill level improves.Definitely too dangerous for kids, dogs or mountain bikes. And if you are at all afraid of heights avoid this one. The views are both dizzying and staggeringly impressive."", ""Trail is very strenuous with lots of switch backs. It took us more than 3 hrs to reach Jones Peak. It's a good work out trail. Make sure to bring water. "", ""This trail follows the eastern edge of Bailey Canyon.  My son and I attempted it to Jones Pk. Almost made it, but we ran out of time and had to turn back.  We hiked 1/4 mile past the cabin ruins and quit.  The trail to Jones Peak is very narrow, very steep, and has very steep drops into the canyon beside the trail.  For this reason I wouldn't recommend it for small children.  We came across quite a few people coming down the trail.  I don't know this but I have a suspicion that they went up the Little Santa Anita Canyon trail and came down Bailey Canyon--which is probably what we should have done.  On the map Little Santa Anita looks to be a little easier to deal with on the uphill side.\n\nThere is also a waterfall trail in the canyon that doesn't go up the steep sides of the gorge.  This one may be suitable for children."", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '',

In the summer, it can get brutally hot so pack extra (cold) water and leave the dogs at home if it's really hot because it's too much for their paws. \n\nYou can go back down from where you came OR you can go down Stough Canyon to avoid the steep steps down.

There are some relatively steep climbs and you get a nice workout. If you keep a steady pace you can make it to the top in about half an hour. Some tricky areas after rain, I recommend taking a flashlight toward dusk. Mountain bikers, and groups some nights. It get's pretty cold in the winter and there are some larger rocks throughout the trail as a result of sliding so it's best to keep an eye out. The trail itself is fairly wide, some narrowing toward the peak. Always worth the climb."", 'Very strenuous and rewarding hike. Bring a water bottle if you go during mid day as there is little shade.

It is a steep 3+ miler. Great workout. Excellent conditioning trail as I train for Mt. Whitney. There is no shade along the trail and minimal shade at the top. Be sure to bring enough water as it does get very hot. It's a fun, no-nonsense trail that I am definitely going back to. Great find in the local area."", 'Really good hike.  Extremely steep which makes a great work out.  Easy to follow and find.  Good views of the city.', 'Vital link trail is the best ""work out"" trial in the Verdugo Hills.  It may not be as busy as Runyon Canyon and other city trails, but it gets busy, particularly on weekends.  I hiked it most recently with my son and daughter.  We started the hike at about 5:00 to catch the sunrise at the top, and on the way we passed lots of folks.  One even had a mini boombox to blare some music, and most folks run down the trail.  In short, the hike itself is much more ""work out"" than scenic.  It\'s a great hike to get your legs in shape for longer hikes (if you start at the base of the canyon, I\'m thinking it\'s about 2,000 ft. elevation gain in about 2 miles or so.)\n\nThat being said, it\'s a nice mini-summit and the hike takes you straight into the center of the Verdugo trail, so you can make a left to head towards La Tuna Canyon or you can turn right and head towards Glendale.  On one occasion, I hiked up the Vital Link Trail and then cut east.  I went straight down the trails into Montrose and then walked directly to Black Cow Cafe for breakfast.\n\nHere\'s a couple of navigational notes: There are three trailheads in Wildwood Canyon to lead you to the Vital Link Trail.  The first is at the main parking lot at the base of Wildwood Canyon.  This will be your only option if you\'re hiking before sunrise or after sunset, because Wildwood Canyon is closed outside those hours.  The other two trailheads are on the left-hand side as you drive up Wildwood Canyon.  Taking the later trailheads will save you some time and energy, cause there\'s quite a bit of elevation gain right out of the gate on this hike.\n\nAnd oh yeah - it can be brutally hot and there is NO shade.  This hike is awesome early in the morning, but I never do it mid-day during the summer.\n\nOne more note: A lot of the pictures posted here are NOT the Vital Link Trail.  They are of the trail the leads up from Stough Canyon and passes by the old Boy Scout camp.  That trail is nice, but is much less strenuous than Vital Link and is much wider - that trail is more popular with mountain bikers and dog walkers.', ""Here's the thing. We haven't hiked in a while. Also the fact we went off someone's else's trail and we went off trail on theirs and ended up climbing the top of the mountains almost killed us as well. Mix in the fact that it was 100 degrees while  hiking and you mixed a hard hiking day. It's not a 5 star hike because the scenery isn't the best. However if you follow our tracks today intensity wise it's a 5. The entire trail except for the last mile is up hill. Enjoy."", 'Great trail due to little minimal ""traffic"" especially if you want to get away from Runyon or other ""city"" hikes. If you are going to go, plan your timing wisely with how much water you will need. Don\'t go on empty stomach as the dryness, winds, heat can really bear their brunt on you. Great hike to burn some calories and there are some stretches where you can run. It can be brutal getting to the top but it totally worth it as the top view is amazing especailly early in the morning around 7\'ish.', ""Sitting at the top of the trail right now as I type. Awesome hike.  But it's 100 degrees here (thankfully the wind at the top tempers it) and there was only a single shady spot the whole way up (except for tight next to the parking lot), so bring. Few bottles of water per person. For those of you submitting reviews saying this hike is fine for beginners, quit being such bad a$$e$.  I'm in pretty darned good shape and I had to stop a fee times to rest. So when you make it sound like a nature hike to bring anyone on who isn't already in pretty great shape, you're misleading them.  If you're looking for a walk in the park, this ain't  it, meaning it is NOT a beginner trail.  As for the rating, I would have given it a 5 if it had shade and/or some water features to view. Otherwise it's a great hike. Views are majestic at the top, the silence other than birds and the wind is golden, and in the 70 or so minutes it took me to make the climb, even at 1:30 on a Sunday afternoon, I saw a grand total of 2 other people.  Will definitely come back.  Oh...and parking is abundant and free.  "", ""To set the stage, I'm in pretty good cardio shape but new to hiking as a hobby. Took on this trail on an April Sunday morning for the first time and enjoyed it all the way. PROS: Well maintained trail that keeps you on an incline all the way to the top so your calves will be burning. Not too crowded and you're rewarded with an awesome view of the San Fernando Valley.  Can get from the trailhead to the top within 60 to 90 mins depending on your pace & endurance. CONS: Besides the incline the terrain is not much of a challenge for seasoned hikers who may be looking for less beaten paths and longer loops. However, good trail for weekly workouts depending on your training objectives. I can definitely see why you want to avoid late mornings during the summer."", ""I thought it was easy, I hike a lot it has nice views but not something I would do again, because I love a challenge but if you're a first timer! It's a good trail :) "", ""One of my favorite training hikes. I hike the Vital Link trail about once a month. I do avoid it during the hot summer months, so I'll hike it at night. "", ""it's a good cardio work out for  short distance but it paid off the view of Burbank city  I keep going back to this trail but warn you it can be sweltering hot during summer!"", 'Hiked trail earlier today.  Do not let reviews discourage you from hiking the trail.  It is not difficult. Not too busy thus afternoon and the path is very wife.  Highly recommend and will definitely hike it again. ', ""Tough hike, good workout! Even if you're in shape, it will be a good workout. From the trailhead, you go straight up for a mile and a half, 1600 ft. Trail is well maintain, not too crowded, and great views of Los Angeles from the top. Good practice hikes for tougher hikes"", ""Very good hike, I've been hiking here for a couple years! The trail is well kept and maintained. Nice view of LA at the top by the radio tower. Very good workout and great for dogs- on leash. It can be intense for 1st timers but you can always opt to go down at the half way point. Overall it is my favorite place go for an excellent workout."", 'This hike is simply amazing!!! I hike it at least 3 times a week. Let it be known that this trail is not for beginners, it has an extreme incline and it starts off at an incline. The best part about this trail is the amazing view. Before this trail I would run the runyon trail, my fire crew hikes this all the time and it is about 1,000 feet hire than Runyon which gives it the breath taking view. If you want to have fun and feel like being daring than run the trail on the way down. ', 'This hike is awesome even for an overweight dude like myself. Takes me and my buddy forever to get to the top because we are constantly taking pictures of the scenery. Awesome views the whole time. The view at the top is the best makes the struggle to the top even better. ', ""I'm rating this trail with 4 stars, because it's an ole' favorite of mine. The views are so spectacular, allowing a rare glimpse of nearly the entire SF valley and beyond on a clear day. There is a bench on top of the mountain overlooking the Burbank airport, that is if you opt for the left trail where the trails fork rather than going up to the radio towers to the right. You can actually hike across the entire mountain which lets out just above Glenoaks near Sunland Blvd. Watch out for rattle snakes though. "", ""VERY tough out of the gate (uphill for a 1/2 mile). Saw some MT Bikers going up it and couldn't believe it. Good view from the top, but an unbelievable amount of gnats that buzz your face the entire time."", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '',

large lake, perfect for swimming in summer \nfairly busy in the summer', 'We got to the trailhead early.  It was a crisp 21 degrees at 7am.  The beginning of the hike (first mile) is the hardest (moderate level).  The hike has a great path that not too rocky and gorgeous views of the mountains peaking through the trees throughout the hike.  You arrive to the lake and it’s definitely chilly, but we were the only ones and it was amazing to have the entire lake to ourselves.    Great moderate level hike.', 'Gorgeous hike! The views as you’re about to reach the lake are grand and gorgeous. The lake breeze was pretty chilly so bring some extra layers if you’re going to hang out for a bit.', 'Good hike. Cathedral Peak is quite something. We went mid October and there were no mosquitoes.', 'Although someone said journey matters not destination, in this case the at times strenuous journey was more than made up for by the incredibly beautiful lake! If you’re not acclimated to being around 9000ft above sea level- it’s gonna hurt as you heave up the first mile or so, and not so easy coming down either. But can be done take lotsa water and take it a little slow. Better to acclimatize drink some cocoa leaves tea , or matte is said to work good as well! Enjoy!', 'Amazing Views! Possibly my favorite hike yet.', ""Great views! Best going lower 1st, because the upper it's amazing! We spent 6 hours, almost 2 relaxing and taking pictures."", 'Takes a good 3 hours round trip, plus time to relax at lakes. Very beautiful area makes it worth the hike there. Bring lots of water!', 'This hike was a favorite!  The views of Lower Cathedral Lake was awesome!! Upper Cathedral Lake was surprisingly windy.  This hike has so many great views and a scenic walk in the woods.  Most of the incline is at the beginning while your legs are fresh.  Worst part was all the horse poop.', 'Fun hike most of the uphill is at the start of the trail. Saw a Coyote in the trail so keep your eyes peeled.', 'Great hike! Shout out to Brianna and China for not waking up and coming with me. Enjoy the awesome pics pendejas!', 'Did this 9/2 to 9/3 - so happy there were no mosquitoes in sight.  Perfect weather, not too crowded despite being a holiday weekend.  Camped overnight at Upper Cathedral lake, and only saw two other small campsites set up.  This is such a beautiful area.  We arrived at the walk-in reservation station off Tioga Pass and had to wait about a half hour and listen to the rangers give speeches about responsible backpacking, which were actually great reminders.  But glad we were able to secure walk in reservations.', 'Really awesome trail! My first trail out of Tuolumne Meadows. A little tough in the beginning but quite a few flat sections to catch your breath. If you want to extend the hike a bit I highly recommend walking around the lake when you get there.', 'My favorite relatively easy backpacking trip. I kind of want to do this every summer. It’s so beautiful. If they allowed me (and I was engaged), I would get married here.', 'Amazing hike, and super rewarding once you get to the lake. We went there in early June, so there was a lot of snow on Upper Cathedral Lake and a lot of rushing water at the lower end of it. We then went on the Sunrise Lakes, Cloud’s Rest, down to Yosemite Valley.', 'Did the hike in early June during my first time in Tuolomne Meadows. Found it more strenuous than usual for the elevation gain because of the higher altitude. Got a bit confused and diverted from the trail at the last bit before reaching the lake. The view of Cathedral peak was impressive.', 'The hike is not very strenuous or difficult in any way, although there is some elevation gain and you already start at higher elevation, making things a little more difficult. Moderate feels like an appropriate rating... The hike itself offers little in the way of views until you get to the lakes, which, however, are beautiful and well worth the effort, and provide a good alternative to the over-crowded valley floor. If you want to see a part of Yosemite that is less touristy, this is a good choice.', ""This was my very first hike and it was spectacular! I started at 6:30 AM and quickly learned that the trail wouldn't be as easy as I had thought. The first 1.5 miles are a strenuous uphill walk. I was completely exhausted within the first 10 minutes but the reward at the end was worth it. I started at 6:30 AM and was back at the trailhead at 10:20 AM.\n\nLower Cathedral Lake was absolutely gorgeous. I was the only one at the lake so it was like my own retreat. I would definitely hike this trail again and I recommend this trail for beginner hikers. Just bring plenty of water. I went through 4 bottles."", 'nice hike but not super scenic on the way.  The lakes are beautiful, specially the upper one. Make sure you take a good mosquito spray. I have never seen so many mosquitoes in my life !', 'During Late-July, the weather was filled with clear and smoky skies.  The Ferguson fire made a big impact on the conditions. Most of the day in Tuolumne Meadows, the skies were blue until around 3pm. At the trail head, park along the road. Find yourself hiking up the transverse. The elevation is pretty high for a valley person like me. Warming upwards, the hike is nice but very popular. The climb from the trail head to lower Cathedral Lake is around 1000 feet. Climb another 200 feet to the Upper Cathedral Lake which provided another good view. Throughout the hike, find flowers and foliage that are pretty. Overall, nice hike.', 'Hiked on 7/24. LOTS of smoke from the Ferguson fire. Trail has a small rocky section (around mile 3.5) that may be hard for small children/adults with balance issues. Lakes totally worth the climb. BRING WATER.', 'Very hard at the beginning but so nice !', ""Love this trail. Beautiful scenery along the trail that finally opens up to an amazing meadow, the likes of which I had never seen growing up in Vegas. I don't think we actually made it to the upper lake because we couldn't really tell where the trail continued from, but we were certainly satisfied with what we did see. The first climb at the beginning can be hard, but then it gets pretty easy."", 'beautiful views', 'This was one of my favorite hikes I’ve ever done! The trip up is a bit steep at 1500-foot elevation climb, but I enjoyed the challenge! There’s a freshwater spring in the middle of the hike which makes for a perfect break point. The beautiful stream, view of the mountains, and view of the forest was incredible. Once we got to Cathedral Lake, the views only got better! I wish I’d brought a dry change of clothes to take a dip in the picturesque lake, but there was a strong breeze so we only waded out to where the water reached our shorts. Gorgeous view of the lake and mountain. Highly recommend this hike/possible swim!', 'We went up to the lake lake last Friday 07.06.18Hike was 8 miler moderate r/t. Beautiful views, and swim at the lake was awesome. Definitely  my bucket list for backpacking soon!', 'We went to the Upper Cathedral Lake and it was beautiful. We were told from a local that there was a ridge that we could walk on that would offer us views from 4 different lakes. Im not sure if we truly ever found the spot, but we did get some great views of lower cathedral Lake! Bring lots of bug spray and loose clothing!', 'Gorgeous views from both lakes. The hike up is fairly steep - definitely leaves you winded! But it’s a good hike and the views are fantastic. Definitely go to the Upper Lake. We liked those views best! Only reason it’s not 5 stars is the bugs. The mosquitoes are killer - I used a ton of bug spray and still got eaten alive.', 'Relatively easy, accessible hike to a beautiful lake-mountain view. As of a couple of days ago, it does get a bit muddy at spots. The trail out of the woods to the lake is mostly covered in mud and water so a path seems to have emerged left of the actual trail (see my posted hike). Go all the way to the end of the posted hike for upper lake as that is where the money shot was for pics and sitting for lunch.', 'Went in late August and it was a great trail. Good hike. If I remember correctly there are some gradual uphill switchbacks, but nothing too challenging. The destination takes the cake. Camped at Upper Cathedral Lake for a little more privacy, but it’s a popular spot so you’ll be around other campers regardless. Got on the trail late. Saw a few people heading back from their day trek so the motivated can do it in one day, but I highly recommend camping there. Got very chilly at night, but the stars were brilliant (as expected in Yosemite).', 'As per other recent reviews in May 2018, this trail is still quite snow covered. Took us way longer and was more of a trudge than we’d planned for. Just be wary it will take longer (path hard to keep to, little to no markers) and be more arduous. We visited both lakes, and preferred solitude of the upper lake.', 'Beautiful at the lake and following Cathedral Peak up. But going up right after Tioga rd opens is not recommended, over half the trail is covered in snow with no real trail markers. Everyone got lost going up and down and the meadow is a marsh. Wait a few weeks to go! I would have given a lower rating, but could see how this trail would be nice under normal conditions)', 'The view at the lake is every bit as incredible and ""worth it"" as everyone says, but be aware that if you\'re hiking this trail before the snow melts, it can be quite difficult. The elevation gain is intense, and much of the trail is covered in snow and not always well-marked, so be prepared to get a tad lost a few times if you don\'t have GPS. Bring layers, hiking poles, and leave early enough so you can spend lots of time at the lake. It\'s gorgeous!', 'By far the greatest hike my girlfriend and I have ever been on. We went on the last weekend that the Tioga Pass was open, no one was on the trailhead. We too the lower lake route. The first mile is the hardest, gaining elevation really fast. We took a few breaks when needed. The rest was fine. I recommend going the end of October/start of November if you want the best view. There was some snow from a recent rain, rivers & waterfalls frozen. I plan on doing this hike again next year.', 'Good day hike. We did it with some snow on the trail, which made it a little more challenging.', 'Wonderful memories revisited and a great workout.Love being up here in Autumn!', '', 'Definitely recommend this trail to everyone. Went this past Tuesday & the weather was lovely! We even caught a few glimpses of snow. The beginning was a little steep and had me out of breathe but it got much better. The only reason I won’t rate it five stars is due to lack of signs on the way back from the trail. It can be confusing. Boyfriend and I came across a hiker who was lost & we worked together to find our way back on the trail.', 'Good hike; some (but not many) views along the away but the lake and mountains view at the end are worth it.', 'We overnighted near the base of Cathedral Peak, just beyond the Budd Lakes drainage.  Spectacular views!', 'Road is rocky, hard to walk', 'Pretty hike, I went to the upper lake and on the return trip stopped by the lower lake. Both lakes had there own beauty. Saw several deer along the way. On the way down keep an eye out for little waterfall next to trail, note water source is coming out of ground.', 'Nice hike with beautiful lake views. Unfortunately, there were too many mosquitoes to properly enjoy the lake.', ""Hiking + Swimming ~ Moderate trail as noted. Pretty long uphill at the start to a quick descent back to another relatively short climb for a final downhill to the lake. Took a right and headed the lower lake. There's a few heavily run deer trails which and lead you off the main if you get distracted and try to follow the stream downhill, so keep your eyes peeled. Once you make it to the final meadow you'll know you're there. Enjoy the swim, but be sure you're up for it as it's just a little bit chilly. As a side note read up the night before on local fires or the like - had to add 60 miles roundtrip due to fires near Glacier Point which added an hour each way to the drive."", 'Absolutely breathtaking both elevation-wise and scenery. We got an early start and had lunch by Lower Cathedral Lake. In the return hike we saw a deer. Very serene.', 'Cathedral Lakes is the sight to see. Tough climb to get there but well worth it!', 'Enjoyable moderate hike with some typical Yosemite granite cliff scenery. As of 7/28 there is zero snow on the trail - its muddy at times and bug spray is still a must. The sign at the intersection is confusing because it points down to ""Cathedral Lake\' (not Lower) while the trail up doesn\'t mention Upper Cathedral at all. The final .5 to Lower Cathedral is a bit of a logistical challenge - pretty swampy, a balance beam style log crossing over a still powerful stream and a lot of trees down and no obvious indication of where the trail goes. Lost it a couple times. If you\'ve never done it before, feel confident in your ability to retrace your steps with landmarks or use a GPS/map and compass to be sure you\'re going the right way. You probably can\'t get too lost with Cathedral Peak and a loud stream to use to keep your bearings, but hazards await if you\'re careless. Upper Cathedral is smooth sailing, so long as you are well-DEETed.', 'The fifth day of Yosemite hiking: We hiked from Tioga Road to Lower Cathedral Lake. The bugs were terrible.', ""Awesome trail with trees, creeks and extraordinary view of the cathedral peak and the granite rocks than surround the lakes. On the way up we encountered the trail covered of snow but easy to follow. At the end the spectacular and frozen cathedral lake. Quiet and relaxing. I couldn't resist the temptation to jump in the water. We rest a little and enjoy the most exquisite view in front of us. Beautifully amazing."", ""You'll need a GPS to navigate the snow melts, which cover about a 3rd of the trail. You'll also get wet, especially as you get closer to the lake. I was given advice that once you reach the fork that goes down to the lake, stay off the trail and keep to the right of the stream to minimize the amount of bog you go through. As long as you keep it within earshot, it's hard to not end up at the lake."", 'This hike is worth it! Once you reach the top the view is absolutely stunning! I will be doing this one again.', 'Was amazing a bit hard at the very beginning but worth everything!!', ""Beautiful hike to some alpine lakes. The first part of the hike is actually pretty steep, but as soon as you get past that, it's an easy and enjoyable hike. We got lost for a few minutes on the return portion because the trail wasn't marked very well. There were a fair amount of people on the trail. I recommend this hike if you want a day or two outside of Yosemite Valley. Tuolumne Meadows area is very beautiful and worth the drive!"", ""Did a day hike to lower cathedral lake with the kids in June. Steep climb up and in with lots of switchbacks but good tree cover so you are in the shade. Great views of the meadows through the trees as you make your way up. We didn't make good time for the reason, we were constantly stopping for pictures! You cross a stream several times and in early season I recommend you wear waterproof boots as my feet became very cold and wet. The views as you drop into lower Cathedral Lake are amazing and the lake is beautiful. The trail disappeared at times as we dropped into the lake, just follow the stream and you will be fine. Great Yosemite hike! Just a note we had snow on the ground and you need either a gps or very good trail skills as the trail was very difficult to follow in the snow."", 'We started a late Friday afternoon backpacking trip with this trail. It was a great trail to just get into the backcountry on. The hike up to the lower lake was fairly strenuous at first requiring a lot of strength going uphill for quite a ways... I think gaining roughly 1000 ft or so. It was dark once we got to the lake but the stars were bright as ever and the night sky looked gorgeous. We woke in the morning to an incredible view of Cathedral Peak with its reflection on top of the water. (Try and camp on the western side of the lake for an amazing sunrise and early morning view of Cathedral) We spent a little time at the lake fishing in the AM and also climbing around all the abundant surrounding granite. From here we back tracked to the intersection with the John Muir trail and headed towards Echo Lake but decided to go off trail and head upwards gaining another 850 feet or so to Echo Peak. Since we got a late start after enjoying our morning we decided to ditch our packs early and make it to the top of echo for the sunset. Scrambling up steep gravely hills we finally made the summit and watched the sun go down. It was absolutely incredible up there. Sitting on small pieces of rock high above our initial campsite at the lake we had never-ending views with faint glimpses of Yosemite Valley, Clouds Rest and Half Dome. We made our way back down to our pack at dusk and decided to set up camp just under Echo. We woke to a cool morning in the ravine and had our breakfast and coffee... From there we decided that we may as well get to the top of Cathedral so we packed our gear and started the short trek to the base. We dropped our packs around lunchtime and started our ascent. We made it just about to the top of Cathedral before I became a little weary of my strength and the clunkiness of my boots to make the rest of the climb up. A couple of us got maybe 75 ft from the top or so while we watched another buddy(who was a little more confident) make it all the way up. After hanging out and relaxing for a bit we headed down completely out of water and in need of a bite to eat. We determined heading to Budd Lake to refuel was probably for the better before walking the 5 miles out to the car. At Budd we took a little swim and refilled everyones water (filtering of course)... Then we took the trail that heads out of Budd and meets back up with the John Muir Trail out near Tioga Pass... The trail out was incredible. Winding through the lush forest following Budd Creek there were many opportunities to take in the scenery and snap a good photo. I really enjoyed my short time in Yosemite and would recommend this section of the park to anyone that wants to keep away from the crowds. Cathedral Lake was fairly busy but if you off shoot up to echo it becomes very private and actually feels like you are alone in the wilderness. I plan to come back and may continue in this section of the park but would like to go much further in...', 'This is a beautiful hike but it’s not without its difficulties and challenges.\n\nFirst and foremost this trail has a lot of elevation gain and the first half of the trail starts out as a combination of uphill and steps, levels out for a bit, and then goes in to rocky switchbacks.  It then levels out again for a while, and you then either have to uphill for a short while to get to the upper lake, or downhill to the lower lake.\n\nMake no mistake, this is a difficult hike.  I am overweight and out of shape, and guys who were obviously thru-hiking were even commenting that this is a difficult hike, so I didn’t feel TOO bad about it.  It took my wife and I much longer than the rated times to complete this trail, I think it took us around 6.5 hours.\nThe scenery however is fantastic; there is something to see throughout the trail.  The trail starts heavily wooded, along the way to the lakes you will find a nice stream with some good photo opportunities, and eventually the spot in the ground where the water bubbles out and created the beginning of the stream.  Along the way you will also see some wonderful views of the Eichorn Pinnacle, Cathedral Peak, and of course the lake itself. \n\nBecause it had taken us so long we only went to Lower Cathedral Lake, so I cannot comment on the views of the upper lake.  The Lower Lake however has a fantastic walk through a sub-alpine meadow before you get to the actual lake, and then you get to a huge rocky area along the shore of the lake, where you will see fantastic views of the clear blue water, as well as the mountains overlooking the lake.\n\nThere is also a lot of traffic on this trail, since it’s part of the John Muir Trail there were a lot of people on the trail who were on their way to Sunrise Camp, we saw people easily every 5-10 minutes the entire way, on the way out we saw a steady stream of people heading back out until fair late.\n\nOne downside is that since this trail goes to one of the High Sierra Camp’s is that they use pack horses to transport stuff back and forth, which means there is a TON of horse poop all along the trail.  There was horse poop every couple hundred feet, so you have to dodge it the entire way.  When the trail is level it’s not so bad, but when coming back down the rocky switchbacks it makes picking a route difficult because not only are you trying to find the safest way down, but you also have to dodge horse poop.\n\nI really enjoyed this hike, despite the difficulties that it gave me.  The views are some of the best I have seen on a trail and if you can manage to overcome the elevation gains, it’s well worth it.', '', ""Such a beautiful hike.  I think I was smiling the entire time.  We left from Tuolumne Meadows campground so added about five miles overall but it was so nice to come back straight to our campsite instead of having to drive anywhere.\n\nThe lakes are gorgeous and peaceful.  There were a good number of hikers and equestrians at Lower Cathedral but for how big the lake is it seems everyone was pretty spaced out and it didn't feel crowded.  Upper Cathedral Lake was really where we had the best time as we only saw two other hikers and they only stayed briefly.  \n\nAt Upper, we had a nice little lunch and then had a quick swim (cold water feels great on a hot day but the wind was picking up).  Total seclusion.  Just the best time.  Wildflowers everywhere in the meadows you cross to arrive here and snow still up on some bluffs in July.\n\nWould do again and again and again.  Great hike."", 'We started the hike from the sign on the road showing the trailhead to Cathedral Lakes.  It was a little over 7 miles round trip and took 3 hours. The views of the surrounding area and alpine lakes were amazing.  This is a popular trail, cars were parked all along the road.  There were a few stream crossings and the trail was muddy in some parts.', 'This is a popular hike judging from the many cars at the trailhead alone. Get there early and find a nice space. The hike is not very hard. A few sections uphill but nothing major. There are many people coming and going because this is part of the JMT, so you will run into a lot of backpackers most likely. Cathedral lake, the lower one, sits beautifully under cathedral peak. The pass and the upper lake is a nice place to visit too. You can do it. This maybe a nice place to backpack and relax, and perhaps allow you to see numerous sites nearby.', 'Hiked mid-June and found much the trail still covered in snow.  Thanks to all trails, I was able to keep my group and a few others on the trail!  Loved the views at Cathedral Lake!  Very rewarding at the end of the 4 mile hike.  Budget at least 6 hours for a round trip.', 'One of the most beautiful hikes I have ever done', 'Great hike! The lake was beautiful.', 'Beautiful alpine lakes. Perfect for swimming.', 'Great little hike with a beautiful lake at the end.', ""This is another gorgeous Yosemite hike.  The first half is the hardest, but then it becomes pretty relaxed and pleasant.  Most of it is wooded.  The lakes are stunning.  We hiked from Tuolomne campground, so it was a bit longer.  A lot of backpackers on it and there is a backpackers' campground at Upper Cathedral Lake."", ""John Muir considered Cathedral Lakes the closest place he had ever seen to a church, thus the namesake. He was right. It is truly amongst God's greatest beauty. Worth the hike, which is on the harder side of moderate. So, so worth it. About a five hour hike total. Loved every minute of it!"", ""I agree with Ricky, it depends on where you begin. We started at Tuolumne and we got to Cathedral Lake upper, after hiking most of the day. It was the end of July, very warm and what seemed like a never ending ascent! What a site to behold when you make it to the very edge, at the base of Cathedral peak, to see the lake glistening down the mountain! We made our way down and set up camp for 3 days~ no fires were allowed, but that didn't take away from our camping trip! It was a full moon on the lake~ gorgeous!"", 'One of my all time favorite hikes! Easy enough without being a cakewalk, good distance and beautiful waters!', ""Absolutely awesome hike though it's all about the destination in this case.  The journey is strenuous because of lack of oxygen up there.  And 7 mile is very subjective and depends where you start as our hike totaled 10 miles because we started from tuolumne campgrounds. Went 7/7/12 Saturday.  Not crowded at all.  Unfortunately I did suffer from altitude sickness after the hike.  Fever, nausea and insomnia.  I have never suffered from alt sickness before.  As soon as I made it out of the park in the morning I was fine.  I guess there is a big difference between 8000 ft(my previous high) and 9000 ft.

We took our five year old with us and she managed it well, but she is accustomed to walking several miles at a time. It was a bit tough for us on the return because we were all tired, but it's not worth doing if you don't go all the way - it's not until the very end that you see the ocean, and sitting on those cliffs listening to the waves crash is worth the price of admission.

A couple switch backs in between but beautiful terrain and this route was less crowded then coming back. Keep on following the Sky Trail, you will see some signs. All said and done it was almost 11 miles (17km). Took me a little over 3 hours. Arch Rock was hard to get to because the direct path was covered in intentional debris. But it's still worth going down and seeing the coast!"", 'Loved it.  Many views. Love that you can camp after 3 miles or 9.', ""Great views at the end but didn't find the walk itself anything special. We had older people with us so the mainly flat elevation was good for them however."", 'Long hike, mostly flat. Would have rather taken a horse. Beautiful views towards the end though. The actual Arch Rock trail is closed. At the branching of the trail hikers are forced to take a different route due to it being closed off. Took about 4/5 hours total.', 'The very best for running. Tough start but the rest is relatively easy for trail runners.', 'Beautiful hike. I love doing the uphill part first and then having a nice relaxing hike the rest of the way.\n\nWe had lunch on the beach. Took a swing on the buoy swing.\n\nCruised back to the parking lot on the very easy ending. \n\nIn the field next to the last outhouse there are some nice tree benches for a little nap before returning to civilization.', 'We started from Bear Valley Trailhead, hiked up to the Sky Trail and went down to the Kelham Beach. We walked all the way the section of the crumbled Arch Rock in the Point Reyes National Seashore. From the beach we returned to the Bear Valley Trail and back to the trailhead. The weather was perfect, partial sunny, no wind..It was a wonderful hike.', 'Long flat walk to pretty spot on the beach.', ""Beautiful trail, modest elevation, mostly shaded.  Waterfalls, streams, and a beautiful ocean view at the end. Go to the bathroom at the visitor center at the beginning of the trail because the flushless toilets are pretty gross.  Arch Rock has collapsed so let's start a contest to rename the trail."", 'Nice long hike. Trail is relatively flat and most of it shaded. Great views of the coast once you reach the end of the trail. Watch out for the horses and the piles they leave.', ""The trail is great, well maintained and shaded most of the way. Too bad the Arch Rock itself has collapsed. But there's always an option to go a little ways along the Coast Trail and down to the beach. Overall - good hiking trail."", 'Beautiful. Hard, but every single drop of sweat was worth it! Definitely will do it again!', 'The land bridge that formed the Arch Rock has collapsed and the pathway heading out to the point has been covered with limbs to discourage people from heading out there, which also happens to be the only way I know of to get to the beach below the cliffs. The hike is along a well traveled and well maintained trail, with a restroom (non-running water type) and a few garbage and recycling bins located at the top of the hill. The trails are all well marked and there is even a bicycle rack at the bottom of the Bear Valley Trail.', 'Very wide, great training trail', ""Did the hike along with some connecting trails several times a few years ago.  Pretty much a flat hike and only rated moderate due to length.  One of the prettier busiest hikes around.  You never know what language you're going to hear on this trail.  The other trails in the system especially those along the coast are even better but this is the route to get to them."", 'Ok', 'Okay hike. Path down to the ocean is easy hike back is much different. Arched rock was closed which was a bummer.', 'awesome hike!!', 'Accessed this trail from Old Pine Trail on the way to connect to Coast Trail. Moderate hills at times, pretty scenery, nice first glimpse of the ocean.', 'pretty nice. the trail is actually a gravel road for the first 3.5 miles.  I did 9.3 miles at an average of 3.38 mph. I deleted by accident and hope I can recover it on my pc. a very easy walking trail that winds through a very thick forest loaded with massive Douglas Fir trees that reach 100+ feet.walked all the way to the coast but could not get there due to trail closures.  I had to take a pic of the Pacific Ocean from 3/10 of a mile away.', 'Beautiful, easy hike.  We did it in December after a rain.  Easy hiking on wide gravely fire road.  Fern, canopy trees , babbling brook, cool but not cold, perfect for hiking.  Great time!', ""Went with my wife last weekend.  The trail is large enough to walk four abreast in most areas, and is pretty well maintained.  It is under the cover of trees and very lush with beautiful ferns and still some running water that runs parallel to the trail.  A couple sections are muddy but did not pose a problem. Overall this is a wonderful experience and I can't wait to hike on to Wildcat Camp next time. \n\nNote: While it is true that the .2 mile trail section to Arch Rock is closed, you can instead continue on to the Coast Trail and get a good view of Arch Rock and the ocean, including some whale watching."", 'Due to the arch falling, you can no longer go down that far.', 'Great hike. BUT NOTE:\n""A portion of the Arch Rock overlook collapsed on Saturday, March 21, 2015, killing one person and injuring another. The area leading up to Arch Rock is closed for your safety. The land may still be unstable and further collapse or erosion could occur. New hazardous conditions on Arch Rock were reported to the park on Thursday, March 19, 2015. Fissures along the top of Arch Rock had weakened the cliff. Bluffs along the California coast are inherently unstable. They are prone to crumbling and sliding. It is very dangerous to climb or walk along the edge of cliffs. Be aware of falling rocks if walking near the base of a rock face.""\nhttp://www.nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/hiking_guide.htm#archrockcollapse', ""Great hiking, and plentiful, free parking - I arrived at 9am on a Saturday and there were loads of empty spots, and when I left around 1pm there were still spaces and plenty of cars pulling out. It was a foggy day though, so might fill up when the forecast is good.Lovely forest and nice coastline, I can't really speak to the views because of the fog (not the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5). Not too easy but also not strenuous if you're in reasonable shape. Unfortunately the overlook for arch rock collapsed recently, and apparently most of the formation is also gone.  The bear valley trail at the end had some hikers, but other than that didn't see too many other people. In total it took me about 4 hours."", 'Started at Mt Whitenberg (?) instead. Made it a 13.7 mile loop. Just phenomenal. Rarely saw anyone until getting to Arch Rock and Bear Valley Trail. Highly recommend. Loop top about 4.5 hours-would certainly take longer in a group.', 'Busy and muddy trail but easy enough the whole family liked it. Took us 4 hours to go out and back. Beautiful views.', 'I highly recommend this hike to everyone who loves ocean views', ""Was so tired at the end of the hike but was worth it! A lot of shade cover from the trees. hiking next to a creek most of the way. The trail is all maintained. There is a bathroom roughly 1.5miles into the hike. The view from The cliff side (top of Arch rock) is fantastic.  picnic or rest just relax and enjoy the view! The trail down to the beach and the arch is rough, not maintained and dangerous,  watch your step. Over awesome trail. just bring plenty of water and snacks or lunch so you don't tire out."", 'Super hike with a fantastic destination ... Magical walk thru a misty forest opening up to the ocean on top of the Arch Rock. Moderate climb down to the beach and under the ArchRock, but so worth the work!  Watch out for the tide!!! Windy and cool at the beach. About 9miles round trip but mostly flat. Deer, sea lion.....BIRDS!', 'Great hike!  Fairly flat with a couple small rolling hills.  Lots of traffic, can hike or bike most of the way.  Gorgeous view at the end and you can take the side trails at the end down the ravine to the beach at low tide.  A new favorite of me and my wife.', 'Pretty flat and easy hike. Offers some beautiful coastal views!', 'Awesome hike. The trail is well maintained and pretty smooth. The view at the end is amazing.', 'This trail is good for families right until the end. The shear drops at Arch Rock would spell doom for any child not constantly watched. That being said, it was a nice hike in on a very well maintained trail with spectacular views for the finale. Heavily traveled!', 'Did this trail the day after Thanksgiving and had a wonderful time.  Not too many people since it was ""black Friday.""  Beautiful views, will definitely do this trail again.', 'This hike is mischaracterized as a dog friendly trail.  Dogs are NOT allowed on the trail.', 'The perfect day on the coast! Sunny and about 80 ... much better than the hot 108 in the Valley! An easy hike on a wide trail with a great canopy that opens to the beautiful California coast. Spectacular views and a must climb down to the beach for some more great views and picture opportunities. The trail is not very crowded but you will encounter plenty of people at the destination.', ""This is my favorite coastal hike. The trail is large it's a dirt road for the most part. For the first part and majority of the trip you are hiking in the shade. A creek is next to the trail while hiking almost the entire trip. This creates a thick green canopy over your head which keeps the shade in and keeps the area very very cool. There's not much elevation gain it's mostly flat and smooth trail. The high point of the trip is hiking out to the coast and having lunch on Arch Rock. It's a cliff overlooking the ocean.  It does get windy on the cliff. There is a trail that goes down from the top down of the cliff to the beach. I've noticed over the past 10 years that the trail has eroded and isn't as secure as before. Once at the bottom you must cross a creek which goes out to the ocean and do a little rock climbing to get to the sand only about 15 feet worth rock climbing. The average person that hasn't even been rockclimbing can do it.  Once at the bottom you'll see the arch through the clip that goes into the ocean. During high tide the Waves can crash through the arch in the rock. This is a very peaceful and beautiful place. Going down to the beach adds to the hike and everyone I've introduced to this hike has fallen in love with Arch Rock. I'd love to hike this any time. \n\nPS for those who are not used to hiking they may get tired out by the distance of this hike. 8.5 miles round trip. Again the trail is flat. "", ""A nice and easy trail, even though it is pretty long. It's pretty flat the entire time, so easy for the most part but gets a bit boring on the way back. The view from the end is absolutely amazing though! Well worth it! I also recommend hiking down to the beach to explore. Gorgeous."", 'An awesome, longer hike that combines a harder climb in the beginning and ends with beautiful coastal views and and easy walk out.\nStart out climbing from the parking, take a right towards Mt. Wittenberg, and start climbing. Only really difficult part of the hike, nice to get it out of the way. Once up top, start winding your way towards the water and begin the easy walk along the coast. You can shoot down to the water, pick blueberries, and remain fairly isolated until you hit Arch Rock. From there, take the well-trafficked 4 mile jaunt back to the lot.', ""I have taken this hike many times with many friends. It's a 5 Star in my book because it's easy enough for anyone to enjoy, passes through many different vistas from forest through open prairies and out to the coastal cliffs.\n\nIt can get crowded on the weekends in the summer, so an early start is recommended or a mid-week hike."", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '',

a beautiful nature I love the area', 'Fun and a well groomed trail!', 'Love this trail for kids, out of towners', 'Great for the family. Nice picnic areas, and the actual trail is fairly easy with nice views. On the way to the trail, you can see the horses.\n\nMake sure you grab the pamphlet on the way in.', 'Mostly a bike trail', ""Be inspired to take it higher.I've been to Temescal, Los Liones, Murphy Ranch and others in the area. I never really knew how they all connected but I always appreciated that each trail offered its own difficulty, views, history and charm. On this occasion I was looking for Rustic Canyon Loop trail and once again I found myself everywhere but where I intended to be.I arrived at the trail and found that the parking was $12 or a sign that I believe said $3 per hour. Either use exact cash or make sure you have your card with you. Before heading up the trail I knew to expect beautiful views because the skies were clear and I was already somewhat familiar with other trails in the area. I saw horses from the park as I was heading up. There are certain parts of the trail that are dog friendly but beyond Inspiration Point there are signs posted that warn of Mountain Lions. There are lizards all over the place and I was told that there was a rattlesnake so I was definitely on alert. The grade is a gradual climb to Inspiration Point not too difficult but it checks the box for view. You will be inspired from that point because you'll see the panoramic beauty of downtown LA, Santa Monica, the Palisades, Malibu the ocean and the grounds that make up Will Rogers State Park. It's really beautiful out there.After leaving Inspiration Point I was inspired to go higher so after speaking to another gentleman I finally found a sign that said Rustic Canyon. I've tried to get there on different occasions but I could never find it while using my GPS. Long review short I went up another 2 miles or so. The path is pretty easy to follow and they do a great job of marking the direction so you stay the course.I will definitely return here and make sure I have a fully charged phone and downloaded map so that that I can go deeper into the trail and see things that I haven't from the other trails that are a part of this park. I suggest this to those that want to find themselves getting lost in the view, the history and the challenge of going to different paths.

Neat park that was gifted to the state of California by Betty, the wife of three great humorist and cowboy philosopher Will Rogers. If you don't know who Will Rogers is, he is worth looking up and learning about. The park cost $12, and has a small parking lot. Will Rogers house open for tours on the hour. Really though, the best feature of the park is the Inspiration Point Trail, a roughly 2.5 mile loop. The views are amazing. From Inspiration Point there are sweeping views of Los Angeles to Santa Monica, and the beach communities all the way down to Palos Verses.

Taking a left takes you to the south of the trail and taking a right takes you to the north end. The snake was just lying on the side of this narrow trail.

We went on a Monday late morning and ran into only a few people (including a few runners). Although the trail is used by horses, there was very little horse dung whch required careful navigation.

Super convenient location. Only negative is The trail is not well marked when you hit Johnstone rd which led to some wandering around the ucsf housing and then fighting some tight ungroomed trails until we found our way to the marker.

I believe it is a harder route starting from the eastern Sierra side, which added an extra 10 miles or so, but the hike up and over kearsarge pass is well worth the extra mileage. It took 4 days at a relatively moderate pace to complete the loop. My last day was only a six mile day so it is definitely possible to do it in 3 days starting from onion valley. Mosquitos weren’t too bad in late July though I’ve heard that they’re horrendous earlier in the season. Bugs other than mosquitos  were a nuisance so I highly recommend a bug net around your head which I wore half the hike. There are plenty of people on the trail with pct and jmt hikers making their way on the eastern parts of the loop. Visually stunning.', 'We did this trip counter clockwise from Oct 5-12.  We tacked on a few side trips including Kearsarge Lakes and 60 Lakes Basin.  We had one snow storm the day before doing Glen Pass but we just delayed our ascent a few hours until the sun had melted the pass on the south side and then things were not that bad.  It was spectacular.  I would recommend spending at least one day at Rae Lakes, it is the jewel of the hike.  Water was available along the entire trip except for the ascent up Glen Pass.  I carried 1 liter of water on me the entire trip and it worked well for me.  Bring warm clothes as several nights got down into the teens.  We saw several bears but they all kept their distance from us and we had no negative encounters.  Bugs were almost non-existant but we did see 4 different snake species including a rattlesnake the first day hiking in. This was definitely a worth while trip and I will do it again.', 'Stunning hike, hardly a dull moment anywhere on this trail. We did the loop clockwise in 4 days camping at Upper Paradise Valley, Middle Rae Lake and Junction Meadow. Would have spent an extra day at the Rae Lakes if we had the time. We went just after the permit season ended and the weather was perfect but did get cold at night. No crossings and very few bugs. Abundant access to water for most of the trail except the Glen pass area. Highly recommend.', 'WARNING: this trail is NOT 37 miles. NPS has accurate mileage information: https://www.nps.gov/seki/planyourvisit/rae-lakes-loop.htm', 'Did the loop from 9/26-9/29. Gnats were a pain from 5,000-7,000ft. Save yourself endless swatting and bring a head net.', 'Spectacular!! Spent 3 unusual days on the trail, starting at Roads End where we were told we couldn’t go clockwise around the loop. At that time, we felt like it wasn’t a big deal but it definitely changed the trip. After many conversations with other hikers we discovered Counter has a much steeper incline with several switchbacks on your 2 day journey to Glenn’s Pass, whereas Clockwise is still up hill the entire way, but the incline is more gradual. We hiked Day 1 from Roads End to Junction Meadow, around 10 miles steeply uphill and it kicked our butt pretty good. Saw a rattle snake on the trail which was pretty cool. Met a lot of really cool hikers of all backgrounds. It was a challenging hike with many rewards. Day 2 we had a shorter day as my partner was beginning to experience the effects of altitude and we made it to Charlotte Lake around 2 pm to camp for the night. I highly recommend this beautiful spot. Unfortunately throughout the night my partner’s symptoms worsened so we had to get up early and head the 17 miles back down to Roads End. I can say heading down this side of the trail was amazingly beautiful!  All in all a great 3 days and because I wasn’t able to make the summit and swim in Rae Lake, it is a great motivation to head back next year for round 2.', ""We did the loop in clockwise direction in 3 days and 3 nights. Would have been really tough the other direction. Wish we had spent longer at Rae Lakes, it's really a magical place. We went in September right after quota season ended. They now have self-issue permits. The climb was reasonable, good footing in terms of traction, so trekking poles are probably unnecessary, but it did vary from sand-like gravel to boulders. Trail was always obvious. We encountered people every 3 miles or so, more at campsites obviously. \n\nTemperature was in 80s during the day and quite hot in some of the areas without shade. Dropped to 40s at night, pretty chilly with wind. Sun went down behind the mountains around 5:30 and went up around 7. No precipitation and only saw a couple small snow patches around Glen Pass. Bugs were active the first and last 3 miles of the loop towards Roads End. \n\nBear containers are a must. We encountered 4 who were easily spooked by yelling and waving arms. Didn't see rattlesnakes. \n\nNo campfires above 10,000. Recommended campsites: Upper Paradise, Rae Lakes, Junction Meadow. \n\nWe had 1L of water per person with us as you have easy access to a stream or a lake almost the whole time. We had Purinize drops and Lifestraw."", 'Gorgeous! We were a group of 4 and we did the clockwise loop in three days and two nights. The first day we did 16 miles from roads end to woods creek (all gradual uphill). We had a bear in our camp at night trying to get into nearby bear canisters. Second day we did 14 miles from woods creek to Charlotte Lake. The Rae Lakes area was breathtaking and Glen Pass was a killer!Last day we had 16 miles to get to roads end but luckily all nice and gradual downhill. We all would recommend that you actually did this in 4 days and 3 nights instead. This would have give us more time to just chill and enjoy the beautiful nature. Enjoy!', 'Completed in 15h17m car to car as a CCW day loop. More gruelling than I expected, primarily the descent which I expected to be easier. If I did this again in a day I’d go clockwise to save my knees.Perfect weather and gorgeous views I’d love to be back again next year to take more time to soak in the views and camp down at Rae Lakes.Perhaps the single best view was of the canyon basked in the light of a full moon five miles from Roads End travelling south along Paradise Valley Trail.Very few mossies but I travelled the first and last 5 miles in darkness. Saw four bears (1 just after dawn, 4 after sunset - all within 10 miles of Roads End), a marmot, an incredibly close deer, numerous chipmunks and no rattlers. The south fork of Kings River is now so low that you can hop across rocks to cross - no need to seek out log jams.', ""Successfully tackled this adventure as a 3 day/2 night backpacking trip with three great friends. We took the clockwise route around the loop trail. Note that the total distance was longer than indicated in the description of this hike.  The National Parks Service web site indicates that the loop trail distance is 41.4 miles long.  Our hike was just over 46 miles in all.  The difference in distance is likely a combination of GPS accuracy and some side treks along the way.  Camping at Charlotte Lake for our second night did add 2.6 miles to the overall distance. Our hiking itinerary was as follows (distances as indicated by GPS tracking):\nDay 1 - Road's End to Woods Creek Crossing (16 miles)\nDay 2 - Woods Creek Crossing to Charlotte Lake (14 miles)\nDay 3 - Charlotte Lake to Road's End (16.07 miles)\n\nOverall this is an epic hike!  One of my new favorites. Completing it in 3 days is a physical challenge, which may be easier for some than others. Climbing to the summit of Glenn Pass from either direction is taxing.  Have plenty of water, electrolytes, energy gels, or whatever else may give you the strength to persevere.\n\nThe scenery is fantastic, wildlife encounters are memorable (deer, marmot, pika, squirrels, chipmunks, snakes, lizards, and bear). We didn't fish but we did talk with a few others who were fishing along the way and they all reported great success."", 'Hiking this trail was an amazing experience. We went with a clockwise three night plan. Camped at upper paradise, middle Rae, and junction meadow. All three were great camps. You will travel through thick shady woods, grassy open meadows, and rocky alpine trails, all surrounded by gorgeous peaks. We saw a bear .5 mile past upper paradise, a family of deer at Rae, a marmot, a snake (not rattler), fish, chipmunks. The nights are much colder past 10,000ft elev. There is lots of water along the trail, but from Rae over glen pass to lake Charlotte, there isn’t much. You do get swarmed with gnats in the lower miles to start and finish the loop. Luckily, I brought my mosquito head net. The crossing was only lower shin deep. The suspension bridge was awesome. Had to walk across a second time just for fun. Also, a good time chatting with the JMT hikers from woods creek crossing to over glen pass. A friendly trail crew were blasting rock above vidette meadow, so we got held up for about 20 minutes, but it was nice talking to them and cool to hear the explosion. I definitely recommend this adventure.', ""Camped at the Sentinel campground the night before our permit date for Rae Lakes.  Was able to secure a counter-clockwise loop.  To get an early morning start, got to the Road's End permit station around 8AM.  There were a couple of people ahead of us.  Fro being outside the peak season, the trail was still quite busy.\n\nIMPORTANT:  bring a bug net, mosquitoes are in full force the first 3-5 miles in either direction.\n\nSaw 1 bear near the Road's end station and 1 rattler about 1/4 before the first bridge (Bailey?).\n\nReally enjoyed the CCW direction.  You work hard the first 2 days and the 3rd/4th day should be a breeze.  Camped at Vidette Meadow Day 1, and Middle/Upper Rae Day 2...near bear box 3.  Planned on camping at Lower Paradise for Day 4, but had the energy and daylight to finish on Day 3.(big miles but mostly downhill)."", 'Can\'t say we completed the entire loop unfortunately. We entered at Roads End on 8/24/18 where we prepared for the clockwise loop starting on the woods creek trail. We were told about a ""small"" fire at Bubbs Creek and told not to report it as it was less than 1/2 an acre and the park crew were fully aware. We were told it wouldn\'t impede us and it was ""insignificant"". Unfortunately we got turned around at the Bubbs Creek Trail/JMT-PCT junction and had to back track and exit over Kearsarge pass into Onion Valley because the fire had spread and the trail was closed. \nThe trail up to Bubbs Creek was very well maintained and the scenery breath taking. We ran into a trail crew along the JMT/PCT and thanked them for their upkeep of the trail. They really do a stellar job at keeping the trail well maintained. \nUpper Paradise Valley and Rae Lakes are both very busy for camping areas so plan to get there early to ensure a good spot. There were a lot of bugs until we reached Upper Paradise; they weren\'t a bother at all after that point. We had heard they were a nuisance at Arrowhead and Rae Lakes but we had no issue in late August.\nOur planned itinerary:\nDay 1 - Ranger Station to Upper Paradise\nDay 2 - Upper Paradise to Arrowhead Lake\nDay 3 - Arrowhead Lake to Rae Lakes (short day to ensure time at Rae Lakes)\nDay 4 - Rae Lakes to Sphinx Junction. This ended up being Rae Lakes to Bubbs Creek, back to Kearsarge Pass to Onion Valley\nDay 5 - Sphinx to Ranger station', 'A 1988 Anuerism/Major Stroke Survivior completed the trail 4 days in 2000, and 6 days in 2018. The latest was a lot more difficult and exhausting but just as beautiful and exciting. Except the 2 encounters with Ratters.', 'The Rae Lakes trail is awesome! Varied, difficult, and breathtakingly beautiful, and sometimes a little scary! Saw bears twice on the trail in the middle of the afternoon a bit too close for comfort, but survived. My favorite heavenly spot was first encountering the reflection of Finn Dome in Rae Lakes in that gorgeous valley.', 'Great hike. We spent 6 days doing the loop with a zero day near Rae lakes.', ""This is an absolutely spectacular backpacking trip in the Sierras.  Old growth forests, massive granite walls, alpine lakes, mountain pass, rivers....everything.  We just completed the counter clockwise loop in 4 days.  We spend the first night at Vidette meadow.  \nWe started around 9am, got to Junction meadow at 4ish, decided it was worth it to push up to Vidette (after a bit of rain in Junction).  So glad we did that, made day 2 a lot shorter and more time at Rae lake, which we arrived on the second day at noonish.  Glen pass is tough either way you go. Rae Lakes is stunning and I found out why so many people told me this is one of their favorite  places on the JMT. \nThe hike out of Rae descends into the canyon, and you will be exposed to the hot sun, nearly the entire way to upper paradise.  We didn't leave Rae until 9am because we were drying out our gear in the sun from the heavy morning dew. I wish we left earlier and just packed a wet tent. \nUpper paradise is shaded, heavily treed and beautiful.  We had a small bear waltz through camp that evening. We got up early on day 4 and made it to the car by 1030. \n\nI prefer to CCW direction, however many said they prefer the CW route.  I like to get the elevation out of the way and then rest at Rae and head down hill, instead of climbing out of Rae lakes, just my take. \nFew things:\n-The bugs are swarming along the first 5 or so miles in each direction.  GET A BUG NET...Seriously.....\n-Start hiking early each day to avoid afternoon monsoons or HOT sunny weather. \n-no issues with any crossings (the water is shin deep where the bridge is out)\n\nI have been on dozens of backpacking trips throughout the sierras and this is one of my favorites."", 'One of the greatest Sierra hikes I have ever done.  We took 7 days to complete the CW loop so we could take our time while on the JMT portion.  It was well worth it and highly encourage anyone with the time to do the same.  We saw 2 Bears at middle paradise but they never messed with us, however the squirrels at middle Rae Lake did.  They attempted to eat into our snack bags within minutes of us taking a break!  The trail was in good shape with the exception of the bridge being out at upper paradise (feet wet crossing) and another one just before Bubbs ands Woods creek meet up (easy bolder hop).', 'Made this Clockwise hike with Dan M (previous review). I’d like to emphasize our selection of camp sights as I felt ours was a great way to enjoy the best part of this loop.  If you’re hiking the Rae Lakes Loop why not spend some time at Rae Lakes?Day 1 - Ranger Station to Upper ParadiseDay 2 - Upper to Dollar Lake.  Sure, with an early start, you can make it Rae Lakes, but this would be a tough ~14 mile day with ~3,600’ of elevation gain putting you at Rae late afternoon when most of the better Camp sites are taken.  And then since you can only stay 1 night at Rae you’re out the next morning having only spent the evening and night at the best part of this trail. Day 3 - Dollar  to Rae Lakes.  This is a short 4 mile hike.  The crown jewel of this hike is Rae Lakes.  The Dollar Lake stop puts you at Rae before noon, with your choice of any Campsite.  We selected the little peninsula in the NW corner of Upper Rae just to the east of the little strait or stream connecting Upper and Middle.  We were able to relax here all day, swimming in both Upper and Middle, fishing, talking with the exhausted clockwise hikers coming from Upper and the counterclockwise hikers coming thru the pass.  Also enjoyed talking with all the JMT’ers and PCT’ers. This was an awesome, relaxing, well-needed restful day for some Hikers from Louisiana (elevation 12 feet).Day 4 - Rae to Sphinx - up early to enjoy the views from Glen pass at dawn.  It’s all down hill (stairs) from here.  This is about 14 miles.  You can make it all the way but for us it would’ve been late and we didn’t want to drive the 2 hours back to Fresno on that winding mountain road at dusk. Day 5 - Sphinx back to the Ranger Station. If you have 4 nights I recommend this itinerary.  If we had to do it over again we perhaps make Day 4 shorter and Day 5 longer.All in all a great hike!  Enjoy.', 'We were a group consisting of two 50 year old boys and three 20ish year old men.  We did the loop clockwise camping 4 nights.  Camping spots were Upper Paradise, Dollar Lake, Upper Rae Lake, and Spynx.\nRiver crossing at Upper was fine as we utilized a log jam roughly 200 yards downstream from the bridge location.  The only issues we had was with water filtration due to our filter choices but it did slow us down to enjoy the views and catch our breath.  We carried each one liter and I would recommend 2 liters for the pass as its a long haul over to the next fill up area.  I would also recommend an early start for the pass as it does get warm fast.  We started at 6 A.M. to cross over Glen.  Saw bears at upper and spynx.', 'I\'ve read somewhere that this is the most often done hike in the High Sierra and it is easy to see why. You really get the taste of just about everything here - from lush meadows, pleasant forests and swift rivers with waterfalls to snowy mountain passes and crystal lakes, and all that beauty in a loop that can be done in a couple of days! You really can\'t go any better than this.\nWe did our hike in the clockwise direction in 3 and a 1/2 days and it wouldn\'t be that difficult to do it in 3 if needed.\nOn the first day, we started from the permit station at around 10am and reached the Upper Paradise by mid-afternoon. The bridge over the river is still out and we met several groups of people who turned back at the sight of the river that needs to be forded. That said, with hiking poles for extra support and sandals or water-shoes to give you some grip, we didn\'t really feel that it would be quite that bad. Mid-June, the water reached to just around the upper part of my thighs (I\'m 6\'1"") and I\'m sure that later in summer, it will be lower than that (if you\'re not unlucky with rain). \nOn the second day, first thing in the morning, we forded the river and hiked up to where the trail meets the PCT/JMT (in the upper right ""corner"" on the map) and followed those to the Upper Rae Lake where we set up camp at around 5 or 6pm. This was by far the most strenuous day of the hike with 3600+ feet of elevation gain and quite a few up-and-down bits, especially in the first part, which added some extra feet to boot. Nevertheless, the views along this section are just spectacular as you slowly ascend above the treeline, and the lakes themselves are simply breath-taking.\nOn the third day, we started with the first light in order to reach Glen pass before the sun would soften the snow, making it more difficult and dangerous to walk on. Especially since we didn\'t have any micro-spikes or snow-axes, we were a bit worried but, as it turns out, with hiking poles and sturdy boots, the pass was nowhere near as bad as we had feared. Later in summer, things are bound to get even easier, but I would definitely think twice about doing this when there is a lot of snow. After you reach the pass, it\'s all downhill from there and there was no snow at all on the southern side, making the descent a walk in the park. We reached Charlotte Meadows by around 3:30pm and for a moment we debated whether to stick to the plan and set up camp there or hike all the way back to the car. In the end, we decided to take it easy and spent the rest of the afternoon bird-watching, but it\'s easy to see how one could make it from the Lakes back to the permit station in a day, albeit a fairly hard one.\nOn the fourth day, it only took a couple of hours to get to the end.\nSo, in summary, this hike is definitely right there in the top best hikes that I\'ve ever done and I can happily recommend it to anyone who likes the outdoors and is not afraid of backpacking. \nAs other have said, the clockwise direction seemed easier with the ascent being more gradual, and I also felt that it worked better in terms of dividing the trail into manageable sections in a way that you get to camp by the lakes, which I can\'t recommend enough. \nFinally, while on the trail, particularly in the lower sections, keep an eye out for rattlesnakes - we encountered two, and one of them let us get within striking distance before it started rattling, all coiled up and scary as hell. We froze and it slithered backwards off the trail while still coiled (I didn\'t even know that they can do that!) never once taking it\'s eyes off us, so no harm done, but it did scare me a lot. We haven\'t seen any bears but plenty of deer, a variety of lizards, birds, some marmots and a pika at the top of Glen Pass.', 'Highly recommend clockwise. Took me 4-1/2 days— hiked out the morning of the fifth day.  There was a flash flood at the washed-out (former) Paradise Bridge- I heard some people got stranded for hours on an island in the middle of the river. A couple guys went out to rescue them— was touch-and-go. It was a little scary and also inconvenient, with rushing brown water you could not filter because it would clog/ jam up your water filter. No-one told any of us there is a log jam- not even 1/8 of a mile downstream- which features a huge tree you can waltz across the river on. This info would have come in handy for a lot of people that day.This is one of the most stunning hikes you will ever experience... but you’ll have to work for it.', 'Amazing and beautiful place to backpack! So glad I was able to do this one! I did a four night loop with my son’s scout troop. Other reviews have covered most of the info, but I would emphasize that you watch out for bears and rattlesnakes (we encountered a Mom and cub on trail and two rattlers during our hike.). I’d also emphasize that it seems like people are not exaggerating when they say counter clockwise is tougher: we did clockwise and as we went along I was grateful every step toward the end that I was descending that section and not ascending.  There’s plenty of water everywhere and a lot of space to camp and the main sites and those have bear boxes for stuff that may not fit in your bear can. Also, be prepared for the oft encountered Sierra thunderstorms and rain. Lastly, please pack out your trash and toilet paper. It’s not that tough.', 'Great loop gets a little busy at the suspension bridge but you get a great mix of loop hikers and through hikers that can chat around a campfire', 'Loved this loop.  We did it in 3 days and saw a few black bears.  Bring bug spray.', 'We are the “Intrepids” - a group of women aged 40-74 that love the outdoors and we embrace physical challenges.  This hike is not for the timid nor those who are not in shape. We saw some frightening human behavior this past week. We started out our counterclockwise hike up Bubb’s Creek last Thursday only to be turned around about 3 miles in by torrential rainfall and a lighting storm about noon.  Since we planned for weather and wanted a layover day, the 24 hour layover in the Car Campground w a beer was an ok way to spend the night. Lesson: Do NOT let the early morning blue skies lull you into late starts.  Get on the trail by 9am after you get your permit.   On the bright side, the rain is a blessing. It’s predictable from about 1pm to 5pm and lasts about 3 hours. Our skies were very clear from any smoke from fires about 40 miles away in Yosemite.  There was little to no dust to contend with. And be prepared for more visitors than normal.  Yosemite is on fire and vacationers turned south to Kings Canyon it appears. And let me add that I cannot imagine hiking this adventure clockwise.  We loved our expanding approaches each day and the way down was painless and gradual compared to other places we’ve ended on a descent. So we began again on Friday, July 20th. Early. 7:30am.  We were greeted by a young black bear we saw the day before.  She is about 75-100lbs and as cute as a button.  She will do her bear thing and get out of your way; we watched her about 10-15 min each day.  Once over the bridge the trail heads up and up to Sphinx Creek.  This trek was much easier than anticipated as it’s short and the switchbacks are kind. We reached Sphinx campsite about 10am for a 45 min water and snack break.  Not a cloud in the sky.... the way from here starts out flat and gradually ascends. As we would learn the whole trip, clouds would begin to build about 1130am.  By about noon the group was tired and hot and the clouds were a blessing.  There is a rattlesnake in this story I just don’t recall if it was Friday or Saturday that it slinked across the trail rattling at the forward group as they stepped by.  Anyway the goal was Charlotte Creek and we arrived just in time to put up a 10x10ft tarp to stand under (there were 10 of us) while lightening struck all around us as we huddled beneath some shorter trees.  The rains came like a monsoon about 1:30pm.  We spent the next three hours singing and snacking while creating systems to keep our packs dry.  We sat on bear vaults and took turns clearing the puddles of rain from the tarp.  A small river formed under our feet it rained so hard. We watched drenched hikers all afternoon move up the trail non-plussed and others run down stating they were DONE w this weather.  We felt a bit smug under the tiny tarp which we usually bring to create shade in the high country.  About 430pm the rains subsided and the thunder grew more distant. Time to set up camp!  We surveyed the area and noted that the rushing water had created flood patterns so we could pick good drier tent sites by reading the ground and debris deposits. Dinner was a special gyro recipe I’ve put together after years of hunting and gathering and drying veggies.  Basically plain freeze-dried ground beef seasoned w oregano and mint and a dash of Lawrey’s over rice.  Lots of rice.  And topped w reconstituted sheep feta, tomatoes, olives, and red onions further enhanced w tzatziki sauce (yogurt, cucumbers and dill).  We inhaled every bit and we were in bed by 830pm.  Early start Saturday to Vidette Meadow.  We agreed to wake up at 530am.', 'The most beautiful and varied scenery in the Sierra’s. Would recommend a 3-5 day loop. There is plenty of water, bugs surprisingly light despite all reports for July, plenty of hikers and backpackers but quiet places are easy to find. Our group of four packed lightly for a planned single night stay at the Lakes but decided to push the whole route in a single go. Loop mileage varies but according to our 3 GPS devices and totaling mileage markers we felt it was closer to 44-46 miles, not 41 and certainly not 37.', 'Simply amazing backpacking trip.', 'By and far the best and most thorough overview of the Sierras.  If you check this and Yosemite Valley backpacking off your list, the rest is beautiful details.   We took 5 days, 4 nights and did it counter-clockwise. We camped as follows: Junction Meadow, Middle Rae Lake, Woods Creek, and Lower Paradise Valley. The gain to Junction Meadow (Day 1) and Middle Rae (Day 2) was an ass-kicker, about 7,500’ total.  All trails are clearly marked and moderately trafficked. We never went more than an hour or two without seeing someone.  Especially on the John Muir/PCT portions of the hike, the east and north side of the loop, there are lots of PCTers this time of year with great information. Bear boxes are easy to spot and plentiful, and we never carried more than 2L of water at a time. We had two different filter systems: a Katadyn flex bottle for on-the-move filters when we came across creeks, and a Platypus 2L gravity system for camp. The water crossings are fine if you’re careful.  Out of maybe two dozen creek crossings, there are only 3 or 4 that are truly worrisome. Log jams and rocks are plentiful though, and careful treading and good trekking poles will get you across.  PLAN FOR MOSQUITOS.  The mosquitos are relentless this time of year. Especially on the south side and in the Rae Lakes area. We had less trouble in Woods Creek and Paradise Valley. Bring several modes of mosquito repellent and perhaps a face net if you’re sensitive.  The water is chilly but refreshing after a long day. We took dips every day and rinsed clothes.  If you fly-fish, bring a set up. Brookes and browns are everywhere and they’re ready to feed.  We will definitely be doing this loop again!', 'A lovely summer week in the Sierra - one of the best! The lakes were glassy in the mornings and reflected the surroundings flawlessly. We did the loop clock-wise. There were lots of rattlesnakes up to Paradise Meadows.', 'absolutely amazing one of the best things iv ever done', 'An super awesome trail, I can remember seeing a reflection of the Milky Way in Littel Rae lake Along side of Fin Dome!!!! In2000 Can’t wait to get back there this summer!!!', ""Had a great trip here on an unusually warm and clear weekend in late October.  We did the clockwise loop from Road's End in 3 days / two nights.  All told I would've enjoyed having another day or two to spend up by the lakes.  The total mileage for the loop from Road's End is more like 42 and of the few other parties we saw it seemed like 4 or 5 days was the more common outing.  This is a really fine bit of the sierras!"", ""Hiked Sept 26-30th, stayed at Middle Paradise, Woods Crossing, Rae Lakes, and Junction Meadow. Bear boxes at parking lot and each camp site (except at Junction Meadow).Perfect time of year to visit, since not crowded but still beautiful. Got cold enough at night at Rae Lakes to freeze the hose of our Camelbak. Some ice on trail up to glen pass at 11 am. Barely any snow on glen pass, and was easy enough to hike over the one patch at the top after noon in regular shoes/boots.Wildlife highlights: lots of warblers including Hermit and Townsend's in Paradise Valley, Northern Saw-whet owl tooting at Middle Paradise, Lewis's woodpecker just past Paradise Bridge, lots of Clark's nutcrackers, marmots near Rae lakes ranger station, lots of pikas between Rae lakes and glen pass, large flocks of evening grosbeaks and band-tailed pigeons below junction meadow, and an inquisitive marten right above sphinx creek."", 'First backpacking trip was amazing at this loop. Spectacular views, river crossings, and suspension bridges. just be prepared for any weather at any time!', ""Walk-up permits available starting the day before at 1pm. Get them at Road's End permit station. But seems like only 5 available per day. Allocate 3-4 days to complete the loop. Bear canisters are required, as this is an active black bear area, even though we didn't encounter any. Mosquito headnets are highly recommended as there are miles of trail thru swarms of gnats and mosquitos. Water sources abound, so no need to carry more than 2 liters at a time; bring a water filter, though. Going clockwise along the loop is recommended, and pretty much what everyone does. First night in Upper Paradise Valley. Second night at Middle Rae Lakes. Third night at Junction Meadow. Still some snow around Glen Pass, but there's none of the trail. Temperatures were mild. +40 degree sleeping back was enough for me.Wildlife we encountered: Deer, marmots, chipmunks, rattlesnake."", ""Fun times. Glen pass ain't bad at all!!!"", 'This is an amazing backpacking loop.  I did it in July of 2016 and loved it.  Here is my trip report with a bunch of pictures and logistical info: https://backpackersreview.wordpress.com/trip-reports/rae-lakes-loop/', 'Fantastic loop. Especially at Rae Lakes and the campsites before and after your night at Rae Lakes. Spectacular views. It will make you sweat and work for it but well worth it!', 'I did this loop with 3 others back in 2012.  We did go counterclockwise and glad we did.  It puts you into the back-country the very first day.  Meaning, at the foot of high peaks.  It would take almost 3 days before you got that if you go the other way.  We hiked from roads end to a spot along Bubbs creek just before Junction Meadow.  That was about nine miles for the first day with full packs.  That was enough.  Had a big bear walk right thru our camp that evening right as we were getting in our tents.  He never even looked at us, just kept going.  The next day we connected with the PCT and went up out of Vidette Meadow.  We took a detour for one night over to the Kearsarge Lakes.  Very well worth it.   It is really beautiful in here.  The next day we took the trail from the lakes upwards towards Kearsarge pass, and then hung a left on the high trail that reconnects to the PCT.  The views from this trail are some of the best I have seen anywhere in the Sierra.  Once back on the PCT, it was up and over Glen Pass and down to the Rae Lakes where we spent 2 nights.  On our down day the next day, we did a day hike up towards the 60 lakes basin.  We went over the pass and down a short distance but did not go all the way into the basin.  Had a short lunch break with an awesome view up and down the 60 Lakes area.  Then back down to our camp spot for our last night.  A nice refreshing swim in Upper Rae Lake felt good after that day hike too!!  That evening the mosquitoes zeroed in on us and we were forced into our tents sooner than we wanted.  Heard a massive rock fall up by Dragon Lake as we sat in our tents kicking back.  That was really something.  Wasn’t sure what it was at first, then there was no mistaking that sound.  Mother Nature unleashed.   The next morning we packed up while being totally harassed by tons of mosquitoes.  The worst I have seen on all my trips.  Couldn’t wait to get walking.  It was pretty much all downhill from there back to the truck over the next 3 days.  We camped one night at Woods creek Jct.  And then another at lower Paradise.  Then had an easy hike out the last day.  The water in the Kings that year was unusually low.  Went swimming right by our camp site in lower paradise.  Don’t think you’d be doing that this year (2017), or on any normal year.  2012 was a very lackluster winter for the Sierra.  In fact, we did this hike in mid-June that year.  It is one of the best loops in the Sierra, and it is also one that’s on everyone’s list, as it is heavily used.  Lots of people on these trails.', ""I did this trail last year (2016) and I loved it so much, I was really looking forward to doing it again. However, I just got off the phone with the wilderness office about the washed out bridge. Even by my permit date (7/18) he wasn't sure if the water would be low enough to rock-hop/cross. Counter-clockwise is intense, so not sure if I want to do an in-and-out (assuming I could even get permits). Anyone recommend a good five day hike?"", ""Most incredible hike of my life.  The scenery is just incredible.  \n\nWe did the hike in 4 days / 3 nights (10 miles per day).  The hike is strenuous.  If you want to spend a day chilling by the lakes, I recommend 5 days.\n\nOnly down side was mosquitos - they were extremely dense and biting.  I recommend head nets and thick clothes so you don't get eaten alive!"", ""We're doing counter clockwise starting 7/2. Since the bridge is out, we were planning on doing an out and back to Rae Lakes. Has anyone been over Glen Pass lately? Is it safe?"", 'Headed out from Woods Creek on 7/3, wondering if the river will be passable ?', '061017 Trail update:  Bridge is still out at Paradise Valley South Fork of Kings River.  However, we did the out and back for this route (20 miles).  Stunning views and great hike!!!', 'Most amazing views... vast Valley scenes to walking thru lush Meadows. The lakes were absolutely amazing, we stayed at Arrow head lake b4 proceeding over the pass. Not a super rigorous hike overall and well worth it for the views. we did the trip in 4 days which made it quite easy going, 1 of the days we spent entirely at the lakes.  been on several trips and this by far was the best experience for me.', 'The immense snowfall and the subsequent melt from this winter has washed out the bridge crossing the South Fork above upper Paradise and the suspension bridge before the JMT. That being said, it was gorgeous and the trails were super gnarly. You can scale massive boulders or slog through waist-deep flood water. Epic. Bears (plus two cubs) and rattlesnakes abound. Check when they have those bridges fixed (who knows when) and have at it! Was told by numerous sources there were still ~15 ft of snow at Rae Lakes. The counter-clockwise route is very steep, but you may be able to get up further. I turned around after heading clockwise and went up the first two miles to Sphinx Creek Junction the other direction. Two rangers passed by with skis to suss things out. I presume you could get much higher going that way with skis or snowshoes! Views and falls were astonishing. Cannot wait to return.', ""we didn't make the whole loop but we went counter clockwise to Charlotte lake and back. extremely hard counter clockwise. everybody on the trail says clockwise is easier. but amazing and I would do it again. we did see 2 rattlesnakes when we did this hike."", 'Rae lakes is like no other place...brook trout on almost every cast...its no wonder why this is a favorite section of the JMT and PCT...wilderness permit applications start on March 1st...Wood Creek and Bubbs creek go fast...', 'Went August 2016. Absolutely amazing! 5 days. Counter clock wise.', ""My friend and I, did this trail the late autumn just before a snow has covered all this area. We squeezed this trail in 2 days and that pretty intense for us. We walked from sunrise to sunset with short breaks on the trail. I'd say, splitting it on 3 days would be better and give more time to enjoy the beautiful landscapes. Believe me, they are gorgeous there."", ""I couldn't agree more with all the reviews here. Wish I had made my trip longer, but condensed the trip into 3 days as we went clockwise from Road's End. Stunning wilderness, many breathtaking views, gorgeous lake views and pristine wildlife. We encountered a total of 5 bears, so don't be foolish and enter without a bear canister (they're required for a reason). I only wish I had taken more time to venture off trail in the gorgeous 60 lakes basin"", 'Amazing escape from civilization.  Constantly surrounded by stunning views. We spent five days, traveling clockwise around the loop. Saw a mamma black bear and cub five miles in. Camping two nights around the Rae Lakes allowed for a day hike around 60-lakes basin.  Fish were definitely biting in the Rae Lakes, but we were releasing those little guys. There were some excellent swimming holes as we exited through junction meadows. ...body surf on your air mattress at your own risk.

Sparked my interest in native California plants and can't wait to return with some of the knowledge I've obtained since then."", 'I have done this loop 3 times.  All starting from Onion Valley and going over Kearsarge Pass.  This adds 8+ miles but is WELL worth it.  Clockwise is best the experience but I have done both and each has its own rewards.', 'I recently returned from a Rae Lakes Loop solo backpacking trip of 4 nights and 5 days located in Kings Canyon NP near Sequoia, CA. This stunningly beautiful NP is largely known as the step-sister of Yosemite. It is less crowded, inexpensive, less frequently visited and remains in pristine condition. The NP Permitting Station is located an hour inside the park at the extreme east end of the Park. The Permitting Station is located at 5035 feet and the 44-mile trail extends over Glen Pass at 11978 feet (mile 23 clockwise). The trail is considered ""strenuous"" and is, indeed, moderately difficult in several places - especially with 60L+ packs. The very thorough NP Ranger permit briefing includes warnings for rattlesnake and bear activity in the area. The trek is done in both a clockwise (most popular and slightly easier) and counter-clockwise direction. The trail includes intersection with the merged JMT and PCT on the north and east sides of the Loop. Beautiful, pristine alpine lakes are available at Dollar Lake, Rae Lakes (upper and lower), and Charlotte Lake. Adequate campgrounds are provided at Paradise Valley, Woods Creek junction, each of the lakes, and Vidette and Junction Meadows. The trip is ideal for a 2-3 person group where pack load sharing can ease the load for all. Bear canisters are required. Except for a few places, hikers are never more than 10 minutes from a filtration water source that lessens the pack load of carrying water. The trail is well marked and impossible to not clearly see at all times. On my last night in the forest I experienced my first full-on, face-to-face bear encounter. A group of five of us huddled at one campsite at 9 pm and made as much noise and distraction as possible. The bear got within 25 feet. Finally, my ear splitting bear whistle did the trick and after languishing for about 5 minutes the approx. 200 lbs. black bear wandered off seeming disinterested that devouring our collective food source would be too much effort. The textbook instructions for warding off bears was exactly accurate - but the outcome could have been different with a mother bear and cubs. I could not have had a better time, by myself, during this trek. It represented what nature is supposed to be all about. It was, for me, my cathedral of nature. Although completely exhausted when finished, in retrospect, I felt privileged by every step taken. For some reason, RLL is not as popular as many hikes. Maybe the remoteness of the NP discourages some hikers. I cannot recommend STRONGLY ENOUGH that if you want a true outdoor backpacking/camping adventure in remote country and are well prepared physically and have forest experience that you should consider RLL.', ""Amazing trip. Do it and don't delay."", ""Amazing hike. It was scenic at every turn, plenty of water, very strenuous, and worth every step. You get a two for one being on the John Muir Trail and the PCT for part of it. Can't wait to go back!"", 'just did this trail in july with 2 buddies, the whole journey is full or breath taking views. the hike is hard at times but not too bad, its hard to hike when everywhere you look you want to take pictures, lots of wild life bear keg is mandatory we saw 4 on our trip . once you get to rae lakes its unbelievable and the pass is just as amazing !   we made the trip in the summer and slept in hammocks witch I recommend to anyone! just make sure you bring a tarp we got a pretty heavy rain our last night.', ""Wow! Amazing backpacking trip. I completed it in three days but would rather do four days next time because I ended up completing around 15 miles the last day and my knees were jelly.   I did it counterclockwise along with another person and we both were very happy about this. There were times of steep climbing but it was a mostly gradual incline. Getting over glen pass is tough if you aren't used to the elevation (like me), so I forced myself to get up real early for the trek over. I usually don't like getting on the trail until 9am but I was moving by 6:30am and by the time I got to upper Rae lake around 11am I was very happy had gotten up early because the climb was very slow for me and if the sun had been any higher...geez I don't really want to know. As it was, I had sweat dripping off my face and body.I camped at lower Vidette Meadow and Woods Creek Junction. I would have loved to camp at Rae Lakes, probably Upper was my favorite. So pretty and the trout were everywhere. Definitely plan on catching some. They're delicious. I went in late May on a dry year (2013) and the snow wasn't too bad at the summit of Glen Pass but I did need to walk through 100 yards of it, following people's foot steps. Not bad. Standout spots: Junction Meadow, Lower Vidette Meadow, Upper Rae Lake, Paradise Valley"", 'Absolutely stunning trail. We did it two summers ago in June and had a blast. Challenging but not too tough, we did it over three nights and had plenty of time to take in God\'s country as well as bumble our way around some early season obstacles (lots of trees down that year).\n\nOne of the highlights was being told by a couple loop hikers (we did it mid-week, almost zero traffic) that the pass was impossible at this time without ice gear. Once on the PCT section, we met some thru-hikers who encouraged us that it was ""intense, but totally doable"". We camped at Rae Lakes, got up early and hit the trail up just as the sun was on it; the sweet spot of not ice, but not yet mush. By the time we were at the top and coming down the other side it started to get a little sketch, but the worst was behind us and we safely made it. Unforgettable experience. To top it all off,  I did most (-snow) in my Vibram 5 Finger Sprints.', ""Beautiful and amazing!! I'd do it again and again! There is so much water, make sure you pack light!"", 'Anyone who enjoys backcountry hiking, this is a must. The jaunt thru Paradise Valley and up around Castle Domes Meadow was chock full of wildlife, Black Bears, Bobcats and Deers galore. Dollar Lake was a nice pit stop for a food break before the trek into the actual Rae Lakes area, spend an extra day here and enjoy, enjoy, enjoy. The climb up and over Glen Pass at just under 12,000ft was F-U-N fun.

We ended up reversing our direction in the loop a couple times to avoid a closer encounter."", 'We began our hike at the main Sherman Tree parking lot.  I found it useful to reference a map of the Giant Forest that I bought at the Lodgepole Village market.  The map identifies the upcoming trees along the trail.

Instead of walking all the way back up the hill, we caught the free shuttle at the Sherman Tree back up to the main Sherman Tree Parking lot.', 'Started at the Giant Forest museum on the Alta trail and connected with the Congress trail to the General Sherman tree.  A nice hike among the giant sequoias.', 'I started the hike at Moro Rock and with the Topo map I got from this web site I hiked my way to the Congress Trail. Get the map!!! A lot of trails branch off and on while on the Alta trail including the Congress trail.', 'Great easy hike. Start at General Sherman and hike down to the museum. Yes, downhill all the way and mostly shaded. You can then take the shuttle from the museum back up to the General Sherman parking lot. Trees are amazing and we saw a bear.', 'Extremely easy hike through the Great Forest that winds through and shows some of the largest sequoia trees.  We saw plenty of deer and birds on the trail as well..  There are many intersections with other trails if you want to change direction, or stay on the full loop to return.', 'Amazing close up wander through the Giant Forest.

Some nice stands of trees and a few spots with cool views of the bay. Nearby to the Lawrence Hall of Science and UCB botanical garden, both of which are great.', 'All I can say is, come prepared if you have not hiked this trail before or even one like it. It will humble you if you are in decent shape, your muscles will burn and turn into jelly, and you will feel accomplished when you reach the top!Poles or walking sticks would make this an easier trek as the terrain is a little loose at times.', 'The hill is a bit more than an easy little incline, in my opinion!

Parking lot is really small but since we went on a weekday we got a spot. Very steep near the start but otherwise a pleasant hike. Saw lots of lizards and a baby king snake.

A great run while child is at swim lessons at sunset!', ""Basically a fire trail that winds out UC Berkeley you can park at either end of the trail. There are a couple of interesting shortcuts through a redwood grove.   It is quite popular with professional dog walker's so it can be difficult to find parking at the base.

you only view from above.', 'Nice easy trail, can’t take dogs all the way up the canyon because of the stairs. But really beautiful hike.', 'This is not a long hike, and there are limited portions of trails that are accessible due to construction. Also, the portion marked ‘strenuous’ up to the viewpoint, (there is also a not strenuous option to reach the viewpoint) is super cool, though very short. It takes you through a thin sand rock canyon with steep steps and a metal ladder to the viewpoint which allows you to see the marsh and ocean (& the 5 freeway). If you do the canyon portion while running/jogging a few times up & down, it can be a good workout, but good luck trying that in the evenings or on weekends because then it’s just a long line of people trying to get to the top. I bring friends here for the wow factor of the canyon portion, as it makes me feel like I’m in a very-mini Zion Nat’l Park for a few seconds. :)', 'Fun little adventure. Populated on the weekend but worth it. It’s a super cool trail something different', 'Definitely worth stopping by if you want to have a small adventure. Easy location, free parking, beautiful view of the ocean, pet friendly, kid friendly, and great local spot to hang out and eat if you want to make a morning or day out of it. Great photo opportunities everywhere, especially the little canyon. I suggest you make your way up the little canyon for it is a very tight squeeze. keep it at a single file line I guess towards the top.', 'I have been coming to Solano Beach for 9 years and did not know this place existed. It at end of a street, you go down and walk 0.6 mile next to the lagoon (very easy). At the end there is the canyon. Take the right o e way loop trail through the canyon. have to squeeze between the rocks. This is harder. The walk through the canyon itself is maybe 100 yards. Kids love it. Dogs cannot do it because you must climb a narrow ladder at the end', 'Make sure to take the loop to cover both trails. The “moderate” trail is actually more difficult that the “strenuous” trail. Too steep and narrow for dogs towards the ends and may be difficult for small kids. Overall nice short hike but if you’re trying to get away from people and the sounds ld traffic, this one is not for you.', 'Great “caves”', 'was a nice run, easy. would do it again.', 'Was a short easy trail with kids. Views of the lagoon, birds chirping. Kids were thrilled to discover the canyon in the middle of the trails and hidden from the freeway noise. Be sure to wear easy to climb shoes, carry less stuff if you plan to go up the canyon.', 'Great hike, though just a bit too busy on the weekends. Keep in mind that dogs can’t make it through the slot since you have to climb up a ladder at a certain point.', 'Easy comfortable hike.  Cool in the afternoon.', 'Short but lots of fun!', 'Love climbing through the canyons and the views of the water.  Quick but fun hike that doesn’t take up a whole day.  Easy to park and walk down.', 'Fun hike with the family', 'Not much of a hike, but the slot canyons are very cool and worth checking out', 'Beautiful scenes with an element of adventure and climbing. we loved this quick and easy to get to trail.', 'What a special “canyon niche” this is, in Solana Beach, of all places!  Must enter thru North Rios Street - San Elijo Lagoon.  Definitely, a “one way” short “climb, with a few unexpected photo ops along the way.', 'Everyone should come out and hike this trail that leads to a fun little adventure.', 'Been living here my whole life and didn’t know this trail existed until this plastic summer, hidden from the hustle and bustle of Del Mar and Solana Beach with beautiful scenery and fun cave hiking. Pretty narrow but very kid friendly.', 'Rating this a 5 because it’s so close to Solana Beach/Cedros Ave, but you feel completely out of any city. The slot is really cool! I was wearing my 14 month old in a backpack and alone, didn’t see anybody else there, and halfway through the slot I got a little worried about how steep it might be for me. I followed my gut and turned around and went up the other side. Saw pictures on insta that some people brought their kids in there and had no problems, but didn’t want to take the chance since I was alone. Will definitely be coming back soon just to make it through or trade off watching the kiddo. I went on on weekday morning and hardly anybody on the trail, I’m sure it’s busy on the weekend though so start early or early evening for a sunset view.', 'Very cool trail!

My son really enjoyed going thru the canyon and climbing up to the top using the ladder. The reason that this is not 5 stars is that there wasn’t too much to the hike once you did the canyon.

Definitely take the ""strenuous"" route when you get to the sign for Annie\'s. You\'ll get to experience slot canyon hiking which was absolutely amazing. Some technical type areas in the way of squeezing through and grabbing foot/hand holds  but I would imagine just about anyone could accomplish this. A couple high step ups were a little difficult(I\'m 5\'4) but was still able to get up. It\'s an absolute blast and you feel so accomplished when you get to the top. Views from the top are great. I\'m not claustrophobic but at a couple spots felt a little closed in but it\'s not too far to the top so just keep calm and you\'ll be fine. As long as you mind your foot placement it\'s not too difficult.

Was able to make it all the way up on snowshoes. Only one on the trail all day, great solidarity and pretty views. Snow was pretty deep and there was one sketchy river crossing, but other than that it was overall very easy.', 'I’m always looking for trails to take our horses on and this is not one of them. Mostly an easy hike with the exception of 2-3 granite areas that would be nearly impossible on horses. Too many hikers for my likes as well.', 'There is nothing moderate about this hike! It’s definitely an easy one! Perfect for trail running and great for dogs with water along the way and plenty of shade. Reward of beautiful lake at the end! Highly recommend.', ""This is a moderate trail only if you are agile and fit.  I have a fit dog, Shepherd, and it was a scramble for him with a couple of spots where I had to lift him to get him over some rock and log obstacles.  It is NOT suitable for horses by any stretch of the imagination.  There are some semi-steep portions of this trail that are more rock than trail, littered with volleyball sized rocks along sloped granite faces in some places and precarious dead fall bridges in others.  If you don't do rocks or high steps, this is not the trail for you. Horses would not be able to negotiate these obstacles safely, regardless of whether you dismount or not.  If you have little ones it will be a scramble for them too.  We went in mid-November so the bogs, marshes and intermittent streams were dry or frozen allowing us to avoid the bugs.  If you are looking to back country camp be aware that there are a lot of dead standing trees that are potential widow makers.  Also be aware that regardless of fire conditions, the amount of deadfall and standing dead trees in the area make this bowl a tinder box."", 'Be sure to watch for cairns otherwise the trail is hard to see.', ""This was an okay hike for me. No amazing views on the trail except for at the lake itself since you're in the forest majority of the time. There are some small Aspen groves, which makes this hike better because fall foliage is always awesome. The trail is pretty easy to navigate and the weather was rather pleasantly cool today."", ""Camping here was pleasant, but only because we were able to find a spot away from the crowds as there were probably 7 or 8 other groups of people camping here. The lake was swimable and drinkable (with filter), but kind of scummy compared to other Sierra lakes I've visited. If your primary goal is swimming, I would look elsewhere. The hike itself, although short, was enjoyable and offered surprisingly diverse scenery. The trail was easy to follow, but would be a bit more difficult if there was snow. Our hike began with a hail storm at the trailhead haha, but it was clear skies and sunshine after that blew through. Despite the fire ban, one of the groups camping here (a dozen large young men with fishing poles) decided to have a large fire. It was disappointing and frustrating to witness. Please obey the restrictions in place. You don't have to burn things just because you're camping."", 'Nice hike. Easy to find the trailhead. The  trail is well used and easy to follow.  Already frost in the morning.', 'About 3 miles one way, with the usual detours.   A beautiful little lake.', 'Hiked this as a day hike with some friends and the kiddos, ages from 6-14. All had a great time and loved it. It’s a relatively easy hike now the kids are older and would be a good hike for an overnight with kids to get them into backpacking. The trail does split of to the left fairly early on (about 1/2mile) along the small river with a fallen tree as bridge, at this point there were no markers to say where the trail went and could be a little confusing. Other then that the trail is easy to follow and really fun! Lake was cold and refreshing! Not too many beaches but enough rock to share. We’ll be back!', '', '', 'Do you need a permit to backpack overnight here? It would be great if AllTrails had a section with permit requirements for each trail.', 'Great trail beautiful scenery and a very nice lake ☺️', 'beautiful hike. my 79 year old dad found the trail a little tough though, lots of rocky sections. also is more like 5+ miles, 5 according to the sign and 6 according to my GPS.', 'In response to the review ""no facilities and services"", I don\'t think you should have to expect any since it\'s only 2.3 miles in, it\'s dispersed camping, and there are facilities within 2 miles each direction from the trailhead.  Trail is easy to follow if you use the AllTrails app; I literally just took a snapshot of the trail since I don\'t have the pro version.  If you think you\'re getting off trail - yes, it may get a little confusing going over the rocks - look for the stacks of stones and the dirty part of the rock where people drag their shoes through....you don\'t need mountaineering experience.  Anyway, nice trail, not much elevation gain.  We camped there 2 weekends ago from a Saturday to Sunday and still only saw 3 or 4 other campers.  Only advice is to please not camp close to the water even though someone else has cleared space to.  The campers closest to us were only 15 ft from the water, did not leash their 2 dogs, and had a campfire.  They were friendly enough, and quiet, but still...RESPECT THE RULES OF THE FOREST!\n\nBeautiful lake, fun to swim, few mosquitoes and leeches.  Great trail to get your kids into backpacking!', 'Great, easy going trail! Trail was very easy to follow. Expect to see a lot of traffic on the trail but everyone was polite!', 'Best hike so far. Easy trail for the most part. We didn’t have any problem following the blazes like some reviewers. This hike has a lot; wildflower meadows, forrest streams, evergreen groves, mountainous ridge top views and of course the secluded lake. Not too many people there on Thursday afternoon but might get crowed on the weekends.', 'This was a very strenuous hike carrying 50lb backpacks to camp.  Three log crossings and lots of rocky and steep granite sections.  Trail is not well marked in sections, especially at the end.  The scenery is beautiful though and the lake was very peaceful and quiet to camp at.  Note, there are no facilities or services whatsoever from the trailhead to the lake.', 'Amazing hike! Trail is well marked except at end when you hike up a granite boulder when you near the lake. Go to the left here. Wildflowers were beautiful and lake not too cold to swim in!!!', 'not sure i liked this hike. loved all the flowers but trail was not described well by all trails. lots of boulders to navigate and granite to maneuver up and down. Lost trail and never made it to the Lake. I hike a lot but not sure this was for me.', 'Good hike and the lake was beautiful to see at the end', '', 'loved it was awesome views will do it again', 'Beautiful hike to a gorgeous mountain lake. Wild flowers were lovely. Some good bouldering and scrambling opportunities for 13-year old boy that kept him interested on the trail.', 'Trail is dry. No snow. No extended climbs; good for kids. 2 log crossings, but wide and fairly easy', 'great trail! awesome terrain for novices like us. difficult to follow trail in some places. almost no snow left. prepare for some mud.', 'This is one of those trails which are are more about the journey than the destination. The lake itself is pretty meh. There are some granite cliffs next to the lake which are fascinating and very Yosemite-esque. I went on 11/26/17. There was a snowstorm the week before but the trail was clear. It is very hard to follow and there was swampy land and some water on the trail. So make sure you wear trail boots and socks. The ice ponds along the trail at this time were fascinating.', 'Due this trail being so popular and short, I have tried to do this trail in the winter months.\nThe first time in early 2017 we were unable to complete the trail due to so much snow on the ground and high water.\nThis time we hit it just right! Headed up right after a storm that dumped snow only above 6000\' and maybe 6 to 8"" of fresh powder.\nI do not suggest attempting this trail when snow is deep. To many areas where avalanches may occur. There is  a ton of water on the trail so bring your tall boots.\nThe scenery was awesome!\nOur tracks are a little off due to the snow cover but managed to stay on track better on the back half.', 'I would rate this trail as fairly easy - not moderate.  Trail is a little difficult to follow in spots.  A couple of weeks ago would have been better for fall colors.  Very nice hike.', '', 'A great trail! Took 4 friends and 3 dogs. We found that there was snow everywhere. Breath taking!! Most of the trail is well marked. The log across the stream was snowed over with ice, a bit of a challenge! Once we got to the granite, many of the ducks had been knocked over. Another challenge, but we found our way to the lake. We all had a fantastic time.', ""Amazing day- Clear sky's - Warm- not crowded at allDefinitely wear ankle high hiking boots - lots of climbing up rocks and it is steep downhill on them"", 'Gorgeous hike!! We experienced an awesome thunder storm ⛈!!!', ""Beautiful trail. Enjoyed how we were in and out of trees and up and down on the trail. Pretty rocky and some maneuvering on the bigger rocks. The trail makers were over all easy to follow until we got to the large tree trunk that kinda looked like a dead end but once we climbed over it we were able to find the trail after some looking around (over the tree trunk follow to your right and you will start seeing markers again). We headed out pretty early so we didn't see too many people on the way in but by the time we were on our way back their was a lot more traffic. Looking forward to going back."", 'Great short trail. Too many people and watch out for skinny dippers.', 'Very scenic, fun rock scrambling en route to picturesque lake. Some moving water and smaller ponds along the way provide good birdwatching opportunities as well.', ""it was a good up and down trail is a little harder for beginners trying to stay on the path not a good fishing area but decent swimming and camping also there are occasional nudists if that doesn't bother you beautiful scenery and sunsets"", ""Splendid hike very close to numerous state and private campgrounds. No significant elevation change so doable for all age ranges. Beautiful creeks and meadows and varying amounts of hiking amongst rocky terrain and tall forests. And if it didn't get any better than that.. lake Margaret at the end which you can swim and jump off rocks into the water with above average views."", 'People, leave your drones at home! Arrived at the lake to find two drones, music playing, people yelling as they jumped into the lake and later howling at the moon at night. More like an MTV real world special than anything I\'ve ever seen in the back country. Beautiful spot, but an ""interesting"" crowd. Prob won\'t go back on a weekend.', ""I started the trail later in the afternoon and came back to the trailhead to a breathtaking sunset. Such a perfect time to hike.  There is plenty of parking at the trailhead.  The trail is overall rocky although I saw one guy hiking in flip flops.  More power to him but that's not the most appropriate footwear.  There are lots of streams along the way and plenty of areas for dogs to take a dip.  This is a dog friendly trail and several dogs were out today including my two.  I noticed mosquitoes mainly near water so if you're like me and a mosquito attractor than being some bug repellent.  Some of the trail is not marked well but folks have placed stacked rocks and it makes it easy to stay on track."", 'This is one of the most beautiful place, I have ever hiked to. The hike to the lake is pleasurable and you will enjoy each and every stretch you get to pass through at the end of which is a spectacular vista waiting for you.', 'Beautiful hike. More like 5 miles if you hike around the lake after arriving. We had heavy thunderstorms which made it all the more exciting! Going to make this trek again soon!', ""This hike was amazing. I love every moment of it. It's the perfect length and difficulty level. It is so beautiful out here and a great place to swim and cool off. Trail is well marked and over all I would absolutely do this again and recommend it to anyone"", 'A favorite hike for sure! Beautiful with a variety of scenery...lush forrest, open meadows, rivers, lakes and wildflowers galore!', 'The is a fairly easy hike for the fantastic view you enjoy. And a little swim at the lake tops it all off. Definitely a great afternoon', 'Gorgeous Hike with a nice variety of terrain.  ""Moderate"" seems about right as 95% of the trail is technical hiking watching every footfall on the oft-rugged trail.  We had a great time and brought swimsuits for a dip in the Lake and jumped off the rocks.  There were always people there but it still gives a nice feeling of isolation.  Wildflowers still blooming in late July.  We also got caught in a freak summer hailstorm on the way out.  Made the hike all the more memorable.', 'Hiking with younger kids (8 & 9).  Perfect!And a nice refreshing swim in the lake.', 'Loved it!', 'This is a beautiful, varied terrain trail. Went Late July after an epic winter and the wildflowers were lush and up to my waist in areas. The creeks were full and beautiful. Lake Margaret is a gem to hop into to  rejuvenate before hiking out. One tip, pay attention to the many rock cairns and ""i"" carving trail markers when rock scrambling. Bring lots of water on a hot day. Cant wait to go back.', 'Good morning for this hike   Cool to start and great weather   Awesome forest with all the pluses   The river was coo', ""1/2 a liter to 1 liter of water to get there and plenty of water along the way!  My buddy caught a brook trout at the lake and on a Friday it wasn't packed at all.  Easy hike but not for Grandma.  A few log crossing over rivers and a bit of bouldering, but other than that it's cake."", 'Great hike, the wild flowers were amazing. A little hazy from the Mariposa fire but not bad.', 'What more could you ask for?  All kinds of water, terrain, flora, and wildlife. Breathtaking sights, not too strenuous (enough to feel the work but not sore the next day).  I love this trip and so far it is my favorite.  It\'s an annual ""to do.""', 'hiked this trail today 7/2. no issues with stream crossings. water levels are fine. this is a short but fairly strenuous hike with lots of ups and downs and rocks to scramble over. the reward is worth it though as lake Margaret is a beauty! it was a little busy being a holiday weekend and the parking lot was full by 10am but there is parking on the road if the lot is full.', 'Great Trail had a great adventure River was too high to cross but we hiked up higher stayed with the river and had a great time will be going back when the river is lower so we can get to Lake Margaret', 'Short and fun backpacking trip! We go at least 3 times during the spring and summer. We went in the snow and day hiked. Fun boulders to climb as well.', 'Almost unbelievable that there are so many reviews for a little hike that is so remote.  My wife and I did this about 10 years ago and never saw another person in midsummer.  I left her sleeping on a rock and circled the lake.  As I jumped off a large low granite rock into a small clear spot I almost got gored by a pretty big buck. He was laying down sleeping and I startled him and was just inches away from ""feeling"" him.  Great little hike with a few spots to scramble.  There really wasn\'t a trail around the lake at the time but it wasn\'t hard to navigate around.  There were so few people doing the hike  at the time we shared our lunch with a family of ducks that had no fear of us with the little ducklings sitting in our lap eating the bread from our sandwiches.  A memorable day...', 'Went with a group of varying hiking levels. Took us 2.5 hrs one way with frequent breaks. There are some river crossings over downed trees as bridges. Beautiful river that comes from Capell Lake runoff. The last part of the hike is a difficult climb up a very large boulder. The lake was pristine. It is up and down with rock, boulders dirt paths and seems to be very well maintained. Take lunch and water.', 'Great hike, weather was perfect, fellow hikers and backpackers seem to all have smiles on their faces. Peace & LOVE.   UPCOUNTRY Hiker.', ""This was a beautiful trail albeit a little rocky.  I would recommend a walking stick if you have weak ankles.  Some of the trail as in other reviews is hard to follow so you can easily get off track if not paying attention.  For a Sunday it was pretty quiet.  I think I only ran into less than 10 other hiking groups and most had dogs.  The parking lot was full and I got there around noon.  I was able to make a spot and the trail itself wasn't crowded.  There are nice rivers/creeks towards the beginning and the lake was beautiful but smaller.  I would highly recommend hitching an immediate right when you get to the lake and hike up the rocks.  There's a beautiful viewpoint up there and the breeze makes for a nice resting point.  It was also quieter up there since most folks stayed real close to the water.  This trail is approved by 3 doggies and a human!"", '', 'Hiked this trail with my dog on a Thursday. The trail was in good condition and the river crossing was very easy. When we got to the lake, there was nobody else there. Since I knew more people wouldbe coming shortly, we headed to the west side of the lake climbing over the granite rocks to get there. We had a nice cove to ourselves for swimming and lunch. I hung up the hammock and relaxed for a while before heading back. This is a beautiful lake and if you can get here on a quiet day, it is wonderful.', ""If your looking for quite, serene and relaxing- don't come here on the weekends!! Beautiful per usual however there was an awful influx of incredibly rude people at the lake. People were laying on the trails thus making it hard to pass, walking through people's camps with little to no regard of their tents, packs and personal items. Rafters (yup people brought in rafts) were being inconsiderate on the water to fishermen. There had to be in excess of 100 people in and around the lake which is a huge contrast to the past. I'm all for shared space and enjoying the beauty, relaxing and taking it all in but it's hard to do yourself when there is so much chaos. Probably better to do this on a day (s) off during the week to really enjoy the beauty and take it all in."", ""Great hike with the dog. I'd suggest getting there early, as the parking lot fills up pretty fast. It was empty at about 10am and packed when I hiked out at noon or so.Lot's of other folks had hiking poles which might be necessary at certain points for people to keep their balance. However, overall it was a pretty simple hike with only a few water crossings.Might be good to take a map as I bumped into a few people who kept getting mildly lost and going off the trail."", 'Short trail, beautiful flowers, stars were bright at night!', ""This was a relatively short hike but very nice. There are six of us with 3 tents  so it was a little difficult to find one spot  big enough. There aren't very many spots on this lake for overnight camping but if you venture off the shoreline a little ways you will find multiple spots. I would not let this deter you because  it's very beautiful lake and the hike is pleasant.  The water was relatively warm.  The parking lot is not very big and if it is a busy weekend, good luck. We had to park on the highway off to the side and walk down to the trailhead"", 'had a great time. we went when the path was covered in snow and got cut off just before the halfway point so decided to revisit this last weekend. super fun lots of terrain change and the last leg before the lake is the kicker.', 'Great', 'Had a great first backpacking trip w my kids. Perfect for first timers. Definitely pay attention for trail markers. Warm enough for swimming.', ""Great hike. Lots of reward.  Would be great hike for kids even if you cut it short and didn't make the lake.   Our 9 and 12 y/o's had a blast.

Highly recommend !!!!', ""This was a fun, relatively short hike with some ups and some downs!  Lots of flowers, mushrooms, and river crossings.  We only did this as a day hike, so I'm not sure how easy some of those crossings would be with +/-30lbs on your back.  But I plan on trying it!  Lake Margaret is small, but very pretty and has lots of very nice camping spots.  Can't wait to go back!"", 'It was awesome. Quite a variety of scenery and terrain. Trying to find out what the giant billboard is on the north east side of the mountain.', 'Beautiful late Spring day today. We only saw a few people on the trail. The lake is pretty and clear blue water with wonderful rock outcroppings.', 'Great trail; water levels high and some swift moving water - my dog nearly was swept away in one of the water crossings when she decided she wanted to swim rather than take the ""bridge"" - be careful with your pups and keep them on the trail for the water crossings when the water is high.', ""Above average for those looking for a fairly short hike. With so many other trails available nearby, this didn't rock is. Lake Margaret itself is small by nearby standards."", 'Great trail with different  challenges along the way, but all are easily passable. The trail has some rocky areas that can be a bit steep. There are also some marshy so be prepared to get a little wet or muddy. Great little lake with excellent hammock spots! One of the best.', 'This is a favorite of mine due to the variations in terrain, wildflowers and beautiful lake. A great hike!', 'We take this trail every summer. Never get tired of the terrain or the views. It can be quite swampy too early in the season though.', ""Took my brother and friend here for their first overnight backpacking trip this weekend. There was about a foot of snow on the ground so it was little difficult to find the trail, but we made it to the lake in about 2.5 hours. We're all 20 years old and in good shape, but were definitely challenged in the snowy conditions with our packs on. The scenery along the hike was absolutely beautiful and the lake was just breathtaking. If you climb the rock-hill on the northwest side of the lake, you can see the entire valley; an awesome spot for sunset.\nCant wait to come back in the spring and summer to check it out then."", 'It was a great hike. Parts were pretty easy other parts were a bit more difficult.  Averaged out to be a moderate hike! The scenery was beautiful well worth the hike!', 'This is an amazing hike! You alternate between clambering over granite outcroppings and descending to forest floor thru meadows and by a stream. The lake is absolutely beautiful. I would not characterize this hike as ""easy"". As others have pointed out, you have to cross the stream by walking on a fallen log twice. It\'s not as easy as some have made it sound. I think it would be really hard with packs on; it was challenging carrying nothing. The second one has cut branches sticking up just waiting to trip you. You also have to climb up over rocks in a couple of places. The trail is well-marked in some areas but not so well in others. The piles of rocks and sticks blocking the wrong way are helpful. Do not miss this hike!', 'An amazingly beautiful and no rush hike, meadows, granit slabs, dense pine/fir groves, beautiful Mtn scenery... A Great Trail!', 'Great place, just finished it with a group of Boy Scouts.  Although I do have exception with the ""Overview"", the fishing was great when we were there.  In just the morning that we were there, even with day hikers\' dogs disturbing the fish, we caught 8 trout in a few hours at the lake.', ""Day hike on the Sunday before Labor Day.  Weather was low 80's, a slight wind, and slightly smokey from an upcountry fire.  This could be considered easy-moderate for older hikers (or out-of-shape hikers like me and my wife and our 11 year old dog).  There are two water crossings over fallen logs (easy for us, dog had to swim one) and one small rock climb.  The lake water starts a little chill, but you get used to it quickly and was refreshing.  There is also a lazy river (at least at this time) that you can meander back in for a little ways and was the coolest thing.  With the beautiful rock formations and wonderful meadows, I will be back to see what Spring changes.\n\nAnd kudos to the folks who marked the trail with stones and blocked fake trails with logs.  Really helps!"", 'Stayed overnight during labor day weekend.  Beautiful views of the cliffs all around. The water was a little too cold to swim in!', ""Great little hike for a weekend backpacking trip. My son and friends of our's went for an end of summer guy's trip. The trail isn't to rough. Though there are the two log bridges over the creek that were very interesting to get over with packs on. The lake is beautiful, with plenty of rocks to jump off of, but does get crowded on the weekends as this is a popular day hike trail. An all a round great trip to introduce my son to backpacking."", ""Great beginner backpacking trip for my 9-year-old son.  Trail was not too difficult to follow, although we had some difficulties crossing the streams with our packs on.  We ended up taking off our boots and wading across at the first stream, as trying to balance on a log 10 feet above the shallow water felt a little dangerous with packs on.  I loved that the trail had a little bit of everything, and the lake was beautiful and not super cold.  Lots of swimming, rocks to climb, and fallen logs to walk across to keep you busy once you get to the lake.  We didn't have too many issues with bugs, although we did carry and use bug spray; I have been to places with WAY more mosquitos and ants.  All in all this is a great little day hike or overnight trip."", ""Nice trail.  The creeks you have to cross have some pretty large logs that have fallen across. I was able to get across safely with no worry about the logs breaking because they're pretty thick.  The trail is well marked but someone has stacked 3 stones throughout the trail if you need some guidance.  There are a few forks in the trail...just look at the ground.  Others and I have put sticks that block the wrong way.  If you stop seeing the pile of 3 stacked stones, you know you've gone the wrong way.  Towards the end of the trail it gets pretty bushy...don't worry, that means you're going the right way.  Watch your footing in that bushy area though, I notice it's a decaying bank.\n\nBring bug spray.  I should've brought some after reading reviews telling me to bring some but I decided that I didn't need any.  Big mistake.  Lots of mosquitos there!"", 'Beautiful. You are going to cross some water, and this trail is a nice mix of meadows, rocky terrain, and being hidden by trees. Not really a beginners trail, depending on your activity level, but nice. No facilities in the parking lot, so be prepared.', 'Beautiful!! Our little dog had the time of her life.', 'Family friendly hike with fun water crossings.  Great lake and streams to picnic by.', 'Great hike! Lots of water had to navigate quite a few water crossings. It was super fun.', 'Follow the rock piles! My friend and I were stuck a few times searching for the trail because some parts are not obvious but we would just look for those little rock piles & that led us in the right direction.

We explored the small islands on the lake and even camped overnight, there is about 3-4 places that will fit a tent or two at trails end.Be sure to pack water or a water filtration system of some sort, iodine tablets, anything,. seen way to many people going without proper hydration lately.This trail is mostly moderate and just difficult enough to make it strenuous in places.', 'A nice hike for taking the dogs along!', 'Another enjoyable hike! Happened upon it when expecting to do a different hike, and really loved it. We hope to go back for a back packing trip because the lake at the end has some perfect camping areas.', ""Beautiful - busy, but sooooo beautiful. I normally don' t like to see little rock piles indicating that people have been there, but in this case, it was a great trail marker, so thanks folks! Clear hiking, beautiful weather, fantastic sights! Lots of wildflowers!"", 'Trail clear all the way to the lake Memorial Day weekend. Lots of snow melt causing some flooding and heavy mud in the first meadow but pretty easy to get around.  Also created  several very temporary small waterfalls and the river was running very strong and fast.

I would wait till mid June to try again', ""I live in the nearby area and this is my favorite hike.  Made my way up there on May 3 and only got a little over 1/4 mile down the trail before I had to start finding ways around the snow.  Stopped not much further in and enjoyed the awesome view.  Snow melt was in full swing and there were several temporary creeks flowing through the first lower meadow.  It was really beautiful but I didn't see a way to make it to the lake yet.  We'll see how it's looking this weekend."", 'Loved this hike.  The trail markers are almost nonexistent, so the ducking was helpful. Great trail for dogs, super windy on the lake, but a great picnic spot.  Just missed the Aspens fully lit by a few days.', 'Being a NW hiker, this was my first hike in granite and meadows of the Sierras--it was stunning in the summer. This is just the perfect short hike: nIce ups and downs, a beautiful meadow and stream, and a fantastic lake. A lot of different looks/feels of the country too for such a short trail. \n\nNote: I watched others in my party pull multiple fish out of this lake, so I\'ll politely disagree with the ""fishing is no good"" statement.', 'Great hike with a lovely lake at the end.  But this trail is heavily used with lots of trail traffic.  We fished the lake without a single bite.  But did catch fish in the river on tne way back.  We hiked this with our two miniature dachshunds.  They made the hike with only a few places that they needed help  to get up and over.  We would hike this again.', 'Spoiler alert! The beginning, middle, and end of this hike are every little bit of amazing. \n\nMy husband and I, accompanied by our 7 year old Parson Russell Terrier and our 8 month old Catahoula X, hiked the Lake Margaret trail yesterday, July 21. I am still beaming from this beautiful hike and it was the first thing I wanted to talk about with my co-workers when I arrived at work this morning.\n\nComing from the Placerville area, this was an easy trek. It took just under 2 hours to arrive at the trailhead. From this direction (West-East) the easy-to-find trailhead is just after the Kirkwood gas station which will be on your left. There was plenty of parking available when we arrived in the morning, but was full when we left (around 1pm). \n\nAccording to my pedometer app, this hike was just a smidgen under 5 miles round trip. It took the four of us about 65-70 minutes each way. \n\nThis trail is considered “moderate”. I would classify myself on the lower end of above-average fitness and I would rate 90% of this hike as “easy” and the rest “moderate.” The trail consists of varying terrain; mostly soft footing, some large rocks to traverse through (only in small stints), a mostly empty river bed and even a sturdy log to pass over part of a creek. \n\nThe scenery gets 5 stars from me. I was so pleasantly surprised, constantly, during this hike. Wildflowers were everywhere! Being July, I assumed that wildflower season was over. Not here, folks! The moist ground allows for a lush landscape. There was one portion where I felt like I was in the tropics with thick, tall foliage and even humidity! The meadow creek was an absolute pleasure to see. The last time I saw a creek like that was in Montana. Perhaps I need to explore this area more! Fish jumped in this creek as well as at the lake. There was a family of hikers with fly fishing poles and I can only assume this may be a good area to drop a line. \n\nThere are some pools that reflected the hills and trees around them. Incredible places to stop and meditate as long as you have your bug spray handy.\n\nThere is a slight scramble up some rocks that make the anticipation to see Lake Margaret even more rewarding. Exhausted and on the verge of giving up, I finally breach the top of the treacherous mountain only to look down upon the promised land. But it wasn’t a mountain, nor was I exhausted from a journey that I was chosen to take by a grey-haired wizard. But hey, it was fun to imagine…\n\nLake Margaret is stunning. It is on the smaller side, but one can gaze down upon it all day. There are many spots to eat lunch or take a nap. I waded into the lake and the water was warm! Yes, you can swim in this lake without freezing your tush off. Unfortunately, I didn’t have a bathing suit, so wading was my only option that day.\n\nThis hike is great for those of us who love bringing our best buddies with us. My one complaint, however, is the lack of leashes that were attached to all the dogs on the trail. Please, if you are bringing your dog, be courteous to other dog owners who have pooches who highly disagree with having their faces licked and butts smelled by strangers (wouldn’t you be a bit snappy if someone did this to you?) \n\nI give this hike 5 stars. As soon as we arrived at the truck, I was asking my husband when we can go back and that we must bring our friends so they can enjoy this treasure as well.', 'We did the trail yesterday , although elevation gain was easy, I think the easy rating is misleading the rocky trail conditions make for potentially hazardous hikingThe trail was well marked very well and the wildflowers were everywhereThe lake itself was beautiful Like everyone else said , bring plenty of mosquito repellent!!!The trail itself was rated as moderate on the trail map on bulletin board ', 'Nice trail. It is still a bit wet and some ot the trail was under water. We made it without getting too wet. Our dog had a blast. The hike was nice and not very difficult. Highly recommend.', 'Wonderful trail, love it.', ""Went on this hike to get out of the Valley heat wave. Although a bit cooler, it was still hot especially for this area but not bad! The hike is relatively easy with the trail clearly marked and well signed. For August, surprised to see some wild flowers still looking quite colorful and a good amount of water along the way, although the creek that usually has to be crossed in a couple of places was dry. Once at the lake, their were many campers and quite a few day groups. Lots of swimming, fishing, and chillin' going on. Overall, it was a beautiful day and a great easy hike. "", 'Our family (including a 5 month old puppy) completed this 5 mile RT hike on July 4th and we were surprised at the number and variety of surviving wildflowers. The trail is well marked with rock cairns (ducks) but around the 2 mile mark meanders into a small willowy area with a small stream. At this point the trail takes a 90 degree right turn into the willows then loops around a large rock and over a huge boulder outcropping. This junction is not marked so be on the lookout for it.', ""Lake Tahoe - Spooner Lake Park to Incline - North Canyon Trail to Marlette Lake then along The Flume Trail and down the Tunnel Creek Trail to Incline.  This is a great hike and can also be done on a mt bike. Leave the parking lot hike down toward the lake then left up the North Canyon Trail, a moderate, wooded, steady climb up to Marlette Lake(a miniature Lake Tahoe in many ways)about 4miles. Go left along the lake to the Flume Trail in a few hundred yards you'll see the lake and have great views of it for the next 5 miles, the Flume Trail is almost flat.  Once you get to Marlette Lake you'll be shareing the the trail with Mt. bikes (they come up a fire rd. from Spooner Lake).  The last 4 miles are in and out of woods again, but also have some more great views of Tahoe. There is a service that for $15.00 will take you back to Spooner, also there is a $10.00 parking fee at Spooner."", 'I took the family (wife and kids) and found a camp site that easily held four tents. We had room for more. The water is cold, but warmer then other lakes in the area. Nice hike and beautiful scenery. Make sure you follow the ducking or you will go off trail very easy. Ok the bad part. I was very disappointed on how people have left the area. There was toilette paper every where. Not even buried. Come on people. How hard is it to clean up after yourselves. ', 'The entrance and parking is much improved since I started to hike here.  Lots of granite rock with ducks marking the way.  Beaver pond is interesting.  Some climbing towards the end, and the lake is spectacular.  Some hardy soles will try a swim.  Too cold for me.', 'Great hike, one of the prettiest lakes in the Tahoe area! ', 'This was a good trail to do with the dogs, and we had a great day. We brought our butterfly chairs and lunch, so once we got to the lake, we sat for about an hour or more and enjoyed the sun, read a book, ate lunch... Several people were swimming but we opted out of that activity. ', ' A wonderful short trail to a beautiful lake.  The trail was easy to follow and we were rewarded with an abundance of wild flowers.  A good easy walk for novices or pros with only a little time.  The lake offered wonderful swimming, not too cold for a Sierra lake.\nI highly recommend this fun hike.', ""This is an easy 5 mile (RT) day hike, or overnight backpack trip. If you are looking for a nice 1st time backpack trip for the kids, this is a great way to start them out. Easy hiking in and out. When you get there, there is plenty of things to do. Swimming in the lake is awesome and enough rocks around for safe and easy climbing. There's also a beaver dam at the lake exit on the west side. Camping is best on the north east, sun bathing on the rock face along the south west side of the lake."", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '',

We just went on 12/15/18 and there was a helicopter rescue so the owner isn’t lying its happening way too frequently.Unfortunately the popularity of this place due to Instagram, travel blogs and hiking apps like AllTrails have led to an unprecedented number of people illegally camping at the springs, leaving lots of garbage and getting lost requiring the sheriff to search and rescue many people via helicopter. A man died at the springs this past august because he was jumping from rocks into shallow water while trying to get GoPro footage of himself.

Booo!"", 'If you\'re going to do this hike, do it from Bradford Ridge. We did the Bradford Ridge side in July and it was much more enjoyable. Less people, more difficult (we like the challenge) and you don\'t have to deal with the gate guard. We are very respectful people and the gate guard was just rude. We were only going down for a couple hours and they made us take our wine bottle out of our packed cooler and put our firewood on the side and proceeded to tell us ""we shouldn\'t even be open because people break rules all of the time."" We weren\'t camping down there nor were we going to drink. We had brought my boyfriend\'s parents with us. It was just an annoying 20 minutes of telling us about stuff we didn\'t care to know about and the way the talked to us was condescending. I absolutely LOVE Deep Creek Hot Springs but will, for now on, do it from Bradford Ridge if I make my way back there someday. tips:If you do take this side, be short and sweet with the gate guard to avoid a long schpeil. If you have firewood in your car (and aren\'t using it down by the creek...not allowed anyways) and don\'t feel like unloading all of it...put it under a blanket or hide it.Also, if you have a bottle of wine under 10 pounds of ice, water and food and don\'t plan to drink it, don\'t tell them you have it because they\'ll make you dig through the big ass cooler to put it on the side of the road.I am not typically a complainer but figured others needed to hear for themselves.

Gatekeeper wasn’t bad like many have said, we were respectful and chill and didn’t have any problems. He gave us detailed directions for the hike in and some tips, such as starting while there’s still a bit of light, and paying attention to trail landmarks, as the trail can be confusing in the dark. The camping was nothing special (basically a gravel lot) but you’re there for the hot springs, not the campsite. They were as awesome as all the reviews indicate! Would go back again. Actually. We’re going today haha.Considering another alternative—hiking in via Bradford Ridge. Can anyone recommend campsites an easy shot from that trail? Either developed or primitive... Main thing is it’s super last minute so looking for an option that doesn’t require reservations.

They are simple and nothing to be overwhelmed by. It gets crazy hot out there in middle of summer so lots of water and don’t overheat in the pools cos you still have to get yourself back up that hill!

There were definitely quite a few nude people, mostly men. And to our surprise the boys didn’t seem weirded out or awkward or giggly. They minded their business and enjoyed the creek and hot springs. The hike is moderate in difficulty and dog friendly. The trail is very clean. The rocks around the springs are easy enough to climb. Wish more people would remember to pick up their undergarments and trash. There is a $5 (per person) fee. The attendant that gives you the map is a bit abrupt, but I’m sure she has seen too many people do stupid things in the area so it’s understandable. Overall, we will come again, sans children and maybe even camp next time!', 'had some good fun here. went rope swinging. jumped off the cliff into the water and pretty much got in every pool lol. groups of nudist showed up.

I got there around 4 so I only had an hour or so to spend in the hot springs before deciding to trek back out so I wasn’t hiking in the dark. Trails are fairly narrow (12-18” at its narrowest) and steep so I wouldn’t want to hike it in the dark. Beautiful hike in, stunning gorges. Nudists (I ended up deciding to be one of them, when in Rome right?) and other bathers were all very chill and respectful (don’t be surprised by people smoking some weed or having some beers though). Wading back through the river definitely wakes you up for the hike back up the hill (especially in March haha). H20 a must, I didn’t look for the water source mentioned but I did suck down what I brought. Road to the ranch is dirt but well graded, the only iffy spot for regular cars is about 200 yards from the ranch to the parking area.

It's beautiful, fun, and a great workout. Going down is a piece of cake, opposed to coming back up. I wouldn't recommend going when the weather is over 100 degrees, because the hike back up to the top can be very exasperating. If you make the hike in weather that's hotter then you would like for a hike, I can't tell you enough times to hydrate, hydrate, and hydrate some more. I've been to this particular location about 5 or 6 times. Early winter isn't tooo bad, but the water crossing is extremely cold around that time of year, but it's so worth it. In any weather it's worth it. I will continue to go again & again, at all times of the year. Great hike to hang out at for the day."", 'Was a nice hike. Takes you 30 minutes to get out there (downhill) and an hour to get back (uphill). Like the gatekeeper said, “It’s so easy a 10 year old could find it.” Although I HIGHLY don’t recommend taking your kids. After getting used to the nudists it was an enjoyable hang out spot. Everyone was friendly and we all had a blast. The springs were hot and it was nice to take a dip in the cold water down below. There was also a little swing that people were using to jump into the creek. All in all, make sure to be prepared because the hike is steep, brings lots of water, and a no judgement mentality. Just have fun! Happy hiking!~', 'If you enter through Bowen Ranch beware of the gate keeper. He had a mental break down with my boyfriend and I after I accidentally rolled through the stop sign and had to reverse back 8 feet to his window. He WENT off and was unbelievably condescending and disrespectful. I don’t have time to transcribe his rant here. He also asked us if we brought car camping gear or backpacking gear. We said we brought our backpacking gear to car camp with. And he once again LOST IT. He heard us say “backpacking gear “ and assumed we were going to break the rules and not car camp. Aside from the behavior from this man, the springs were gorgeous and the trail was well maintained but steep. Bring a headlamp if you think you might be cutting is close at the end of the day.', 'Well worth the effort.  Came in from the northern PCT approach.  14 mile round trip hike if you are coming from highway 173. Trail parallels the Mojave River in all its glory. Lost the trail just after mile 1 until realizing you must make a water crossing to pick up the trail again on the other bank. Only person on the trail until I reached the springs. The hot springs were lovely. Nice and warm on achey muscles. As said above, lots of nude people. Very kind people, but very naked none the less. Headed back early to avoid getting caught in the dark. Fun hike overall. The long approach made making the springs well worth the adventure.', ""Was a great hike in the middle of nowhere.  Took the non paved road to get there.  The gate keeper was great to us.  Made sure us 3 girls had the correct hiking wear after seeing me in flip flops.  I told him my hiking shoes and everything was in the back.  We are pretty experienced runners/hikers that know what to pack with a little extra.  On way in we ran into people that had no water on them, so we gave them on of our extra waters.  \nOnce you hike in the views from top of hills looking down into the water area was beautiful.  Hiking into the Hot springs, lots of naturalist to see.  Once you get past the awkwardness of what you are seeing, it was a great day.

Can imaging doing this hike in the mid summer.  \nHave fun, not kid friendly if you don't them to see naturalist and peeps smoking weed."", 'Steep hike, lots of naked people extremely worth it. Random dogs running everywhere, lots of pot and hippies but so much fun. Brought my kid but definitely won’t be bringing him back. Much more for adults, will definitely be coming back. Bring lots of water and a towel if your getting in the springs. You have to cross the cold water to get to the hot springs. You must come early unless you plan on staying the night due to it getting dark very early.', 'awesome natural feature.  right off the PCT.  downhill going in and up hill going out.', ""Extremely steep hike.  About one hour to the springs.  Leave when you have plenty of sunlight the trails are very confusing in the dark.  We ended up sleeping on the mountain because we could not find our way back at night.  Don't do it.  Other than that absolutely gorgeous and worth the strenuous hike.

Good hike', ""I chose to come from the 173 to Bradford Ridge to get to the springs, and I'm very glad I did! I think October-March is the perfect time to go. Either way is worth the trip, but here are some comparisons:From Bowen Ranch: hike south-Have to drive a few miles on I paved road-Costs $5 a person or $10 ea to camp-Mike, the gatekeeper, can be unsettling-1.5 mile hike to hot springs From Bradford Ridge: hike north-Limited parking, but fully paved roads-Free with no gatekeeper-2.4 mile hike to hot springs-Relatively flat trail, except for last 0.2 miles"", 'Did this hike for the first time today. Beautiful scenic hike on the way down. Make sure to bring enough water to have on the way back. It’s all uphill. Yes there were naked men all over and you have to laugh at that. Went to other side of hit springs where there was a man performing oral sex on another. There are families there with children. Kinda got the wrong vibe when I saw that. On way back there was a sheriff helicopter circling the area maybe someone made a call. Besides that it is a beautiful scenic hike.', 'What a great discovery! Had a blast in the Jeep driving in via Juniper Flats.  Snacked off the Holly Cherry bush on the way down and enjoyed a great swim and soak.', 'I knew to expect some amazing hot springs, but I didn’t know the hike itself would be spectacular as well. It’s a fairly easy hike, but I’m sure it’s more brutal when it’s super hot out (I went on a relatively cool day). There are multiple small hot springs scattered around a swimming hole. Absolutely amazing! We had fun hopping from one to another and testing out the different water temperatures. We were able to sit in the hottest one for plenty of time (other reviewers have said only a few seconds so maybe the temp changes).', ""This is an amazing experience. my family's come here for years but I just went for my 2nd time. this time my 5 year old daughter came along. She walked every step of the way on her own. The hot springs were perfect and it was perfect at night.

I personally didn't mind, nothing wrong with bodies when we all have them. We started from Bowen Ranch, the road was very bumpy and we almost got stuck in the sand. The hike down wasn't bad at all, but there were times where we had to slide down because of the downhill sandy parts of the trail. The water was pretty warm when we got to the creek, so I didn't go into the springs because of them obviously being higher in temperature. But they were nice to look at. Swam around in the creek and was there for about two hours. We left at around 1:30 and didn't get back to the ranch until just about 3:00. For water, we brought a 1.5 liter, a 32oz, and a 24oz water and even that wasn't enough. Thank goodness for the people we met down at the creek, they gave us an extra Dasani regular size water bottle in addition to the 1.5 liter we had left and it was the exact amount we needed or else we would have ran out on the hike back. Definitely don't underestimate how much water you're bringing!! It was nice for a first visit, but I probabaly wouldn't come back unless I get more experienced in doing these kinds of trails more often and if it's around the spring/fall/winter. I personally can't handle the heat so this is not something I would do again in the summer"", ""So much fun!! The hot springs are worth the distance. Just make sure to bring a lot of water, sunscreen, and snacks!

The creek is awesome, the water is cool and refreshing and the hot springs were like built in hot tubs! Expect to see nudity, lots of skinny dippers! We went on a time crunch ( I had to be at work by 3pm and we arrived at 10:30am).

When we arrived the ratio of naked vs. clothed was about 7 naked and maybe 12 clothed. Water was surprisingly clear but cold, except for hot springs of course. The area was clean and people were nice, a good amount of non-locals. As far as blindfolding my son, which i considered a possibility before i arrived i did not do. There was nothing shameful about seeing naked people relaxing in the water. He handled it very well, i was proud of him. He didn't gauke or stare.

I understand the caretaker\'s need to exaggerate caution. It\'s a popular destination; therefore, lots of inexperienced hikers pass through. Not only are there inexperienced hikers, there are lots of substance-users; many of whom, are just plain imbeciles with little-to-no respect for themselves or nature. So, I\'m sure that many of those who need rescuing were intoxicated before their return ascents. \nThe descent is first, ascent is last. Trail is mostly sandy, hard-packed, free of boulders, roots, and other natural obstructions. It\'s EASY! What a simple, standard, short trail! The views are beautiful, mostly chaparral; strong scent of aromatic shrubs/sage, etc. Do not proceed without water (as is the case in all hikes, duh!). But it does deserve special caution: Hot water + desert climate will dehydrate you! Add mind-altering substances and this place\'s risk factors increase ten-fold! Bring lots of water!!! I imagine that extremely inexperienced hikers and drunken MORONs (""don\'t judge bro!"") are the ones who get lost. The owner/manager/caretaker(?) was firm, assertive, perhaps angry, when I arrived at 3:30pm, yesterday afternoon. He believed I\'d be ascending back to the car after dark. I got back to my car before the sun set (FAST!!!). Caretaker cautioned the hell out of every late arrival, so i didn\'t take it personally. But he DID exaggerate... or I\'m the Flash! \nI\'d love to camp there. Get there early for a day trip, or go camping. It\'s not ideal for a brief stop. I hiked so fast that I was able to enjoy the springs for 1/2-1hour or so, and return to my car before sunset. the trail was super easy to follow, though I am grateful for the anal caretaker\'s exaggerated cautions. But it would have been more worth-while had I stayed there. Camping there must be a blast, especially if you like to party (I don\'t, because I quit drinking...sigh why did i f*cking quit?!). Lots of alcohol, drugs, and weirdness. not for kids, i suppose. The trail is not that bad. If you\'re going to get crazy on substances, even just weed (affects the memory), then plan on camping. Why risk getting lost in the mountains?! I smoked a bunch of Js, once, when I was in Miami, staying with a friend. I bathed in a hot tub for a while, in the hot Miami sun. When I returned to my friend\'s apt, I couldn\'t remember where he lived. My point: be cautious, even w weed, not just alcohol or whichever other substances you use. stoned & de-hydrated will not aid you in staying on trail...or finding the trail.\nBtw, the creek-crossing was refreshing. Not \'ice cold\' at all.\nI only give it 3 stars because the drunken young people and rednecks reminded me of college, when I was a dumb child.', 'This should probably be listed as MODERATE and NOT ""Easy""! Trail was easy to locate.  The hike out is completely straight up and will leave you gasping for your breath. The spray paint markers help you stay on course. The river is up due to recent downpours and it\'s waste deep thru dangerously cold waters. Once your legs are prickly and ready to fall off you will make it across and have no problem stripping down to get in the hot springs. I only noticed 3 pools, but read that there are 4-7...so who knows! People DO NOT LEAVE YOUR TRASH!! This is not downtown L.A. It\'s amazing and beautiful place to enjoy!

There is a $5 fee per person, totally worth it. Brought my dog with and everyone was cool with him and loved playing with him.

It can get hot.', ""This is a great hike and location. I originally went in the winter, which made the trek back up the hill much nicer, temperature wise. You must cross a creek to get to the hot springs. The creek was cold to cross but the hot springs are incredible. They're clean and don't stink of sulfur, like most hot springs.  ::MY ADVICE:: 1. Bring plenty of water. The hike back up is no joke. Especially in the summer heat. Think you have enough water? Bring more. 2. If you cross the stream in the winter, your legs will just about fall off. It's numbing cold. Use your empty water bottles to fill up with hot water from the springs and then dump them on your frozen legs after you cross back. 3. Take it in - Take it out. The creek stays relatively clean so please take your trash out with you. :)"", 'Great hike. Hot springs are great. The directions on this page take you to Bowen Ranch.

There is a natural drinking water source located behind on the the hot pools which drains out of a copper pipe (very convenient for refills!). Hiking back out of the canyon to the parking lots is all uphill and can be very steep at times. However, it's only 2 miles. Very doable.

Still worth all the inconveniences for this unique SoCal experience."", ""The hike is steep and sandy, but the workout is well worth the reward at the end. Plan to get there early so you have enough time to enjoy the springs, you'll want to experience all 6 pools, and won't want it to end!

CAUTION!  If you have a passenger car, consider a different route.  The dirt road is very bumpy, rocky, bonky and wonky.  I loved it and thought it was a lot of fun, partly because it was not my car getting worked :)  We were in my dude's 4x4 truck...he bitched a little along the way hee hee hee.\n\nPitch the weird off scale trail map provided.  It won't really help at all HAHAHA.  When you head down the trail, keep to the right and snake around.

So sad about the trash here! I parked at the Bowen Ranch, paid the $5 to the guy there which is well worth it as i think he really brought a quirky yet responsible aspect to hiking. He provided trash bags and we brought back about 10lbs of trash. Hike back up was harder, I wish i owned a battery powered sander to remove the graffiti on the rocks! Not a hike for little kids just because the trail had a steep drop in some areas. Great views and the creek was a nice place to have lunch.', ""1. Do not use Google maps to find the hot springs!! It will take you to an off roading area in Big Bear. For the hike I'm talking about, which is the easiest from what I hear, go to Bowen Ranch through Apple Valley. I have a Hyundai Elantra and we made it just fine. If you find yourself on any road that you seriously think you're going to get stuck on, you're probably on the wrong road. Its dirt and bumpy, but definitely doable in a normal car, no question. This website has perfect directions: \nhttp://nobodyhikesinla.com/2015/03/26/deep-creek-hot-springs-via-bowen-ranch/\n2. There are almost always going to be nudists here. Don't be surprised, they are super friendly!\n3. It is a gorgeous oasis in the middle of large desert hills. Brings lots of water!! And maybe aqua socks for swimming if you have sensitive feet. \n4. The hike in is easy and only took us about 30 minutes, but we hike quickly and its all downhill. Coming out took about 40 minutes and its all uphill. It was definitely a great workout and a great way to feel like we didn't just sit around being lazy all day! We hike the Burbank/Glendale hills weekly, and this hike wasn't as hard. But I could see it sucking if you're hauling a cooler/tent etc. back up.\n5. Look at the Yelp reviews. Many people complain about Crazy Mike who owns the land that you pay $5 per person to park on. We came during daylight hours and lefts at sunset and never met him. We did however met a lovely lady named Sycamore who made sure we had enough water, gave us a map and directions, and gave us a garbage bag asking us to pack out other people's trash. If you stay overnight (or past sundown) you will be charged an extra $5 per person. They do have campsites available. When we were there, the only trash I saw was a small pile of beer bottles, so it looks like people are starting to take better care of the place. From talking to the regulars, it seems they just raised some of the pool walls so they'd be deeper. \n6. I think there are about 7 pools right now all varying in heat. I could only put my feet in one it was so hot. The big one right on the river is the most popular and temperate. \n7. I read that the water is not drinkable (especially the hot part) and that you will get sick. But regulars there have a hot spout that they drink out of all the time. I didn't risk it, but just do your research.\n8. Pull the sock out of the top of the white plastic drain! It creates a fabulous shower that makes you feel like you're at a spa getting a back massage! Have fun!"", ""Okay, I spent forever trying to find this place. Here's the deal... It is NOT accessible from Arrowhead unless you want to hike 6-7 miles or have a 4wd. You get there by going down the backside of the mountain and through Hesperia. Just google map Bowen Ranch Rd. and that will get you there.Then you have to pay the crazy (but nice enough) man money to park on his property (I have no issue with that). Then you hike 2.5 miles down to the creek. When you get there, turn left and you will find the hot springs.Apparently there's a spot to park if you go left at the last fork as opposed to right, before Bowen Ranch Rd. The man swears that the meth heads will rob you there, but I've met plenty of people at the hot springs who tell me this is not true. Only difference is the hike from there is 3 miles instead of 2.5.Also, if you have a Volkswagen, the man makes you park up higher and so your hike is 3 miles anyhow. Luckily, I hitched a ride with some strangers down to the lower parking. Nudists abound. Just naked people, everywhere. This is not a good spot for children if you are a modest parent. I even came across a fully naked man a mile at least from anything, hiking barefoot through the desert. Also, if your dog is too rowdy consider not bringing them, as it's kind of a relaxation spot and a rowdy dog can muddle the peace. It is a beautiful. The experience is second to none and I loved chatting with all the PCT hikers who were coming through when I was there."", 'Nirvana', 'It was a easy hike down to Aztec Falls and beautiful.', ""If it's hot out, this will be a slightly difficult hike, however the springs are well worth it.

The road you come across is closed and the pavement will run out with a tree in the middle of the parking lot. This is the trailhead. Now you should be able to find the trail. It\'s the southward going Pacific Crest Trail you\'ll know it\'s south because there is a sign saying, ""Deep Creek Hotsprings 6.4"" this is the correct path follow this to the big rainbow bridge, which is very obvious, Cross over it and follow this for the remainder of the way. Following the left side of the creek will look promising with a nice concrete wall but after a short cave it runs out. So be sure to cross the bridge. I will leave a TOPO picture of the location of the hot springs so it\'s easier to find.', ""Very wonderful hike. Lots of hills.

Good 40 min hike down to the hot springs and about 45-50 mins back up.

Take water as it is an open sunny terrain. 5 dollars a person to park at ranch and 10 to overnight.', ""This hike is well worth the confusing directions. I went with a group of people where we initially used Google Maps which led us to a small plot of land about 0.25 miles from a Shooting Range which is mostly for ATV's and OHSV. We had to back track to the I-15 and take Bear Valley rd exit, take a right, kept going for quite some time until we hit Ocotillo Rd, I believe. (For those that are serious the best place to get directions are on Yelp! I HIGHLY-OVER the top recommend taking a screenshot as cellular coverage is obviously going to be spotty.)Once we made it to Bowen Ranch Rd, we DID have to pay $5 per person ($10 a person to camp out overnight) a fairly easy 2.5 miles down. As previously mentioned it is STEEP. so if balance is an issue I recommend using either walking sticks or a good friend to catch you if you slip. Take your time. It's lots of dirt, two or three awfully rocky parts but not expertise level requirement at all. We saw people of all ages and a couple super cute four legged friends.!!Once you get to the springs you'll see why it's worth it!!!The trail leads right into the warm banks of the first (and biggest) hot spring. Unfortunately, when we went (Sunday 8/24/14 @ appx 4:30pm) there was quite a bit of waste left from previous parties. Sad to see. WHEN YOU LEAVE PICK A PIECE UP EVEN IF IT ISNT YOURS!!!)  We decided to cross the bank (it's very shallow - from about mid calf to thigh high) to climb a couple of rocks, above the biggest pool of water where there are appx 2-3 small; more secluded pools. The water in those two are VERY VERY WARM!! If you're sensitive to temperature changes dip your toes in before you decide to sink a leg in and watch it turn red!! The water is soooo clear it's gorgeous! The rocks in all the pools have a fair amount of algae sticking to them so please use good judgement when using rocks to get somewhere.As you've probably heard nudity goes down here. If you have kids - that's up to you - otherwise we're all brought into this world in our birthday suits, shouldn't come as a surprise. If you choose to join great. If you choose not to join, great. Don't pass judgement in other peoples choices...With that being said! It's awesome. Stay a bit. Enjoy the warm waters, there's tons of rock formations overhead to gawk at. BRING FOOD AND WATERAND DONT LEAVE YOUR GARBAGE BEHIND!Pretty please with a cherry on top! :)Bring good food and lots of water, cuz trust me that 2.5 miles back up is going to be a killer! Two people in our group were leading the way up and the remainder had walking sticks or we took a handful of breaks. We left the hot springs at appx 6:30pm and made it back to the car by 7:45. Where we paid for our car the lady gave us CAREFUL instructions to return before nightfall as you will most likely get lost and unless your experienced just do as your told!All in all it was wellll worth it. The sights back were just one of those things that no amount of words can sum up....the sun setting on a beautiful mountain range with every color imaginable in the sky....it's just something you gotta see!!!As a bonus, because we happened to be late comers on the drive back we pulled over and looked up in the sky and let me tell you if you don't think that's some thing to be seen you're crazy! Billions of billions of stars scattering the sky. (FYI our party was from Long Beach so a majority of our nights consist of air pollutants and SMOG exhaust) I was lucky enough to see a real shooting star and to find some constellations in the sky is well worth the extra 10 minutes.Well hopefully my review has either enticed you to go or at least made you chuckle.

There are facilities at the parking area. The trail itself is well kept up, and the grade is very nice (not steep). Maybe slightly rocky (but no problem for this older guy with slightly bad knees). The Bertha peak part did not look inviting (steep double track) or different enough to climb the extra height, so this track goes south-east along the PCT, then back.

If you park here you'll need an adventure pass, OR you can park for free at the Big Bear Discovery center .6 miles east of the trailhead.  The trail itself starts out wide with views of surrounding trees. After the first mile or so, the trail gradually gains a lot of altitude but it isn't anyone can't handle. I took a friend who has never been hiking and she was doing great. The people hiking the trail are generally friend and always greet you. Which is nice compared to the other trails I've been in.  At this time of year you won't see many animals. Once you're near the top, the trail begins to narrow and become filled with snow. The trail ends at the junction of Bertha peak/Pacific Crest Trail. Overall, the trail was decently marked and the view of Big Bear Lake at the top was gorgeous. Going around this time of year makes the view just as amazing. The cougar crest has become my favorite hiking spot for the gradually altitude gain and short duration for reaching the amazing views. Deff planing on stopping by again soon.

It seemed like they improved this road since I last hiked this trail almost 5years ago.  I prefer Grays Peak trail but it was still closed very late this season for Eagles nesting.  The highlight of my trip was an encounter with a timber rattler. This snake was about 2ft from the trail hidden in some branches and leaves. He gave me a very brief warning that he was lurking around. When I identified his hiding place I decided it was safest to stay put and wait since he must feel safe because I immediately froze when I heard the initial rattle.  After a very brief wait 1-2min he decided he better leave (and I was very happy to part our ways). There are a lot of families with children that hike this trail and those kids are all over the place.   BEWARE!! There are snakes out THERE!!  (It rhymes!!)', ""This was one of the first trails I've hiked. I went with my family, and we took kids aged 4-9 and they were fine.

It was muddy, and a little icy in some places. I enjoyed myself and that the view is well worth it. "", ' Very popular trail. I went to the junction then turned left at PCT and went on for about 3 miles. Crossed 2 roads and ran into a Boy scout troop on the way back.

To the right we walked on washed up or out rocks right along the waters edge to the life guard tower, climbed a couple of boulders and started to walk towards a very big surprise we had forgot about......the narrow broken dirt path.  And that is where the real workout began.  Stopping twice to catch our breath, we were able to stand and admire the most picturesque view of the ocean and Catalina.  Parking was $4.

(Make sure your with someone if you chose to take this route.\n OR, go towards the wonderful seacaves/ tide pools. There are two ways to get here. One of them is by going down the normal way from the parking lot and walk along side the beach. The other is to walk a little up PV Dr North from the parking lot along the highway and find the sacred cove trails. Takes you to the same caves but from the other side.  A lot of people come and swim here, but please be very careful! I've seen people go in when the tide is high and it can get very dangerous since the waves get strong and it's surrounded by sharp rocks! There have been some fatalities here, so go in at your own risk when the tide is low. Recommend water shoes!

Going down it definitely seems easy and the trail does go all the way down to the ocean with beautiful views all the way. I definitely didn’t realize how steep it was until I was in the way back up.

No big deal but we were short on time having to catch a flight so would have preferred doing more on top then schlepping up the Park Road.  All was good though as we took in the Scripps Overlook then went down to Razor Point vea the Butte.  Traversed over to Yucca Point which was great too then returned via the West Overlook and the Park Road. I guess I wasn't thinking straight since we could have gone down the Beach Trail and returned via the beach in probably the same time.  Oh well, will be back to this park at some point to finish things up!!"", ""Arrived at 8:30 AM and paid our $15 at the ranger station.  Watch out for walkers on the road up to the upper lot.  For a weekend morning, there were only 2 other cars in the upper lot.  The restrooms were out of order, so they have several portable toilets set up.  The trails were moderately crowded when we started, and very crowded by the time we finished.  Weather and views were beautiful.  On our way back to the trail head we saw signs for rattlesnakes - luckily we did not see any.  After our hike we visited the small nature center.

One thing you need to know is the website says it's $10 for parking but that's for winter time when the temperature drops. right now, and for the summer, it's $12.50.  But you can park right at the bottom by the beach, or follow the road up to the top to the ranger station/parking lot. From there we walked down to the Guy Flemming trail, which is all flat with slight incline, amazing coastal views, loads of Torrey pines. The next trail up is the Parry Groves, keep in mind you have to go down 118 stone steps to start the trail which loops right back around back to the steps to go back up.  There are a 3-4 more trails but we were too tired.  The ranger station is fascinating and educational with their taxidermy animals.  We ended the day walking along the beach."", 'Great, great views.

I’ve probably done it 100 times over the years. I noticed a couple of the reviews mentioned shoes, specifically wearing hiking shoes, which I wholeheartedly agree with for both safety and comfort.

God himself carved out this trail in all its glory... dream of the perfect love...the kind that bows its knee and offers eternal-like love at a perfectly placed bench on the edge of the world..should this world be flat I would certainly fall off... please some share your proposal moment... and after the mountain high life will no doubt circle you back on the challenging path... you will follow a trail that was crafted by the harshness of wind and water..

It is a good climb, but anyone that actually looks at the map before they go can figure that out. Part of the loop is ‘closed’ because it simply hasn’t been maintained for a while, unfortunately.

As far as the trail being dangerous, the most dangerous part of the hike is parking and crossing Highway 1!!', 'Enjoyed this hiked.

Ignored the closed sign as many people were.. a bit of an uphill right after the closure sign but smooth sailing after that. Uphill and pretty tough but great views of the surrounding mountains and ocean await you at the top. Descending down rocky ridge wasn't too bad with poles but might be a little tough for some.

Stunning views up and down the coast.', 'This hike is NOT dangerous unless your wearing sandals like some people do.  If you start into the canyon and hike to the posted sign at 1.25 m. that says to not continue, you will have a immediate -.1 incline, and it’s very doable.  After that it’s smooth sailing.', 'Beautiful hike, a great workout with awesome views. We hiked it backwards and it was nice to get the sea breeze on the way down. Hiking it never felt dangerous.', 'After doing the entire loop today I find some of these reviews to be pretty funny. Yes there are dangerous parts to this hike as one would expect hiking through a canyon and then up to the top of a mountain. We honestly don’t know why the trail is closed though.

Do not attempt to do the entire “loop” to Rocky Ridge from the end of Soberanes Canyon Trail unless you’re used to climbing - extreme - terrain and vertical inclines. Once you start up, it’s too dangerous to go back down and it’s not a switchback trail, but a straight shot vertical incline on sandy, rocky ground (easy to slip) that’s the equivalent of 158 “floors” on the iPhone app. Not for the faint of heart, or people looking to go for an easy scenic hike on their vacation. Hiking boots with tread are required and walking sticks also help. There is a reason the trail is closed and that’s because it’s dangerous. That said, the “safest” option for those who want to see the view from the top is to take the Rocky Ridge trail (instead of the Canyon trail) to the top, enjoy the view, then turn around and descend the same way. Do NOT attempt to continue on and descent into the Canyon via Rocky Ridge trail - the ground is not suitable for descending and there’s no cell reception back there (and no patrol), so if anything happens to you, you’re in the wind. Nonetheless, if you are an extreme climber and want to do the entire loop, start with Soberanes Canyon Trail and when you see the “end/closure” sign, the trail is to the left (yes, it’s unmarked, you have to scale the side of the hill and climb up rocks a bit - again, I don’t recommend that route unless you’re an extreme climber/hiker).', '', '', ""Trail starts off feeling all desert like and quickly changes to forest. Many small streams you'll have to cross. 2nd half of trail is currently closed to hazardous conditions, but still saw some people hiking it."", 'Beautiful hike!

A little of everything, redwoods, I’ve caught some great wild flowers, gorgeous views and a great workout!!', 'We hiked this trail last week (7/15). We accidentally went the reverse way around - take the yellow trail first for the 1.5 miles before it turns into the red or “closed” trail. We packed very lightly from east coast and didn’t have hiking boots - for about 1.5 miles we had to slide down on our hands and butts so we didn’t slip since it was all loose sand on the way down. You can avoid this by starting yellow to red, sandy part up, ocean view on the way down. Bring shoes with tread for safety. Thought I couldn’t do it but when we got to the top it was worth it! You get ocean, desert and forest landscapes all in one.', 'This is one of my favorite hikes! You get a little bit of everything, the Redwood Forest, amazing ocean view, wildflowers that surround you, a nice ocean breeze to carry you down. I would definitely recommend hiking boots for doing the whole Loop, and long sleeves and long pants to trudge through the wild flower bushes.', 'I went through the whole loop - throughthe “closed area” and back down. Watch out for the poison oak on the south part of the trail. Definitely wear real hiking boots/shoes for this trail. The path is a bit eroded in parts and you’ll need the extra footing.', 'I did it for the first time when the trail re-opened in April- all of the wildflowers were in bloom and everything was as green as it gets! The day was clear and the view was spectacular. It’s an easy walk through the canyon for the first mile and some, and then a steep climb to the peak, but so worth it. I went again a couple of weeks ago and it was foggy at the top but it cleared up on our way down. Wear layers for the unpredictable weather and long pants- the upper part of the trail is overgrown and it’s a tick area!', 'Tough trail but worth the effort for the $1m views throughout. So many amazing wild flowers, rolling hills, and views of the Pacific. Did the loop despite the one portion being “closed”. Totally accessible if not just a little overgrown. No real hazards.', 'We got there at 8:30am and parking was good. The views are really pretty and lots of change of scenery but a lot of the trial is overgrown.  After about a mile there is a trail closure sign ...but we went anyways . It also gets really windy at the top. Overall it was a great/ challenging hike.', ""Incredible views from 1900 feet above sea-level.

With breathtaking views, incredible sounds of wild life, beautiful redwoods, relaxing sounds of the flowing creeks and small waterfalls...makes this place pretty majestic. Highly recommended.', 'We went on this brutal and stunning 7 mile hike on Sunday at Garrapata State Park in Carmel, CA. The landscape changed from gorgeous, shady redwoods (absolutely go beyond the signs) to climb up to the Sound of Music-esque rolling hills covered in wildflowers with frustrating false peaks, to the actual peak where the winds almost blew us over, covering us in clouds while we lay cradled in a rock throne. The descent was grey skies, highlighting the colors of the prolific flowers, bringing us over the rain-eroded trail, rough on the knees and ankles, but we made it.

After that are a few cardio stressing false peaks that bring you to a gorgeous view of the canyon and Pacific. The hardest part is getting back down since the Rocky Ridge part of the loop is closed. I parked at 8:30 and passed only one other person on the trail. By the time I was returning at 1015, there were people coming in by the tens.  It’s also already hot; getting there early before the people and heat is best. I can’t wait to do this hike again once it’s fully open.', 'Beautiful trail with plenary of wildflowers and spectacular views. Downhill to the end was kind of hard on the knees but all good.

It then turns into a luminous green paradise of fern and redwoods. one time i saw a huge ladybug hatch, probably 40 sq. feet, magnificent yet a little creepy.There are beautful chiseled log steps in sections. The sounds of birds and the babbling creek are an extra treat! After you crawl up more washed out steps at the half way it turns into open scrub. The ocean view ahead makes it all worthwhile. This is a must do when it opens!"", 'Very steep and challenging but 100% worth it.', 'Start out going right and you will walk alongside the canyon with gorgeous views of small waterfalls. Great variety of terrain and strenuous to burn a good amount of calories. Definitely worth the effort to the top!', 'Did this hike in April 2016.

The hike is worn out, and eroded in the canyons - but nothing that good shoes and good legs can't get you through. The mid sections is open to the sun and we did it during the noon and go scorched. Carry a lot of water and keep an eyes out for the geckos, lest you should squash em under your feet (read: many geckos darting like arrows here and there). We also saw a snake on our way up. The view from the top is spectacular, and makes the hike worth it. The descent is a bit too steep and you can run down it - but being careful about where you step while running down.

Right after the bench at the top is where the decline gets steep and where I BROKE MY ANKLE IN 3 SPOTS!   It almost forces you to run, so be careful and slow yourself down.  It took us almost 3 hours to get down off that mountain!  My husband had to practically carry me down (very steep I remind you) and so he is my new hero.  On our treacherous, painful and slow descent we ran into a hiker by the name of Lee (I think that was his name) who was very well prepared and kind.  He offered me water, electrolytes and an ace bandage!  I hope he reads this post some day as I want to thank him for helping us out!!  He also offered to help carry me down.  THANK YOU LEE!!!  There was one other hiker who offered me a walking stick.  I'll never forget these 2 men who were kind, generous and helpful.  Our next stop was Monterey Community Hospital's ER!!  Now I am back at home looking at all the spectacular pics I took during this very long, painful recovery!  My only word of advice: be prepared and don't wear tennis shoes!

In any case, you will see dogs and I\'ve never seen one on a leash.', ""Great hike, especially when combined with the Ridge Trail.  I've done it in both directions and find the clockwise route easier than counter.  If you start early, then things stay fairly temperate.  If you start at mid-day, it can get pretty toasty.

I felt that the way down was much more difficult than the way up.  Maybe because my legs were sore already.  Very much worth the effort.', ""Rocky Ridge Trail is definitely one of my go to hikes. You have to hike up a very steep hill next to the Pacific Ocean. Seriously a lot of incline. If you are hiking for a workout then this Trail is for you. Since you hike above 1,800 feet above sea level you will have some spectacular views of the surrounding area. The views are definitely worth the hike. On the ocean side of the trail, there is a bench that was built right next to a cliff that faces the ocean. If you chose to you could view the sunset from their. Rocky Ridge Trail is attached to Soberanes Trail and you will also get to enjoy the that trail as well. It is very beautiful. Since it is a loop I would recommend hiking through Soberanes and then hike up the hill if Rocky Trail and then come down the Ocean side. The ocean side is less steep than the other side. One word of caution: wear shoes that have good traction. You will thank me later. It can be very slippery if you don't. Trekking poles might not be a bad idea either even though I don't use them."", ""Soberanes Canyon Trail is one of Monterey County's best kept secret. It features one of the most beautiful trails. You zigzag around a Creek, hence there is a lot of beautiful vegetation around you. It also features one of my favorite trees, Redwood Trees. It has many picturesque moments while on the Trail.
