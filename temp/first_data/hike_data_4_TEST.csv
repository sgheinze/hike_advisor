I would do this again although I wouldn't try to be daring due to the recent death that was on the news about the Indian couple Vishnu Viswanath and Meenakshi Moorthy in October 2018. Thinking back, I even walked down inside a fissure that seemed to have solid grounding underneath between the rocks but I would not attempt that again. This place is so remarkable, you can spend hours taking photos."", ""This is a nice little hike from the road, I did this one first after driving 4+ hours to Yosemite and it was good way to start great weekend.  I't just slightly more than a mile each way, so carry a bottle of water with you.  It is really neither an up hill or a down hill trail either, nor is flat.  It's small section going slightly up or down till you get close to edge, then the last 300+ feet of the trail is downhill till you get Point.  Most of the fissures are to the east (right hand side), so take a little time to view these before making your way out to the point.  At the point, you will find 2 over looks, one on the east with some old guard rails, and one to the west without guard rails (where the couple fell off a week or two ago).  If you're doing this as group, have someone stay at the guard rail overlook with a camera, while your friends visit the other overlook, you'll get great photos here.  Take turns too so everyone get's a photo on the west overlook. Of course, don't fall off and ruin your weekend.\n\nThe trail back starts off as uphill, but then is just slight up and downs till you're back at the road.  While you won't find water here, you will find a set of porta pottys if you need to go."", 'The hike is easy enough and the views are amazing, just stay away from the edge!', 'Easy hike and view was amazing!', ""1 star just so that you notice; views are breath taking and the hike is easy. It's a 5 star hike.But, I lost 2 of my friends from the edge of the cliff Oct, 2018 - there are no giard rails at the edge and it gets very windy. Please be careful up there guys!"", 'awesome views, easy hike', ""Awesome and my personal favorite after my friend showed it to me. Better for those trying to get away from the crowds. Descends off the road to the cliff's edge. There are about 5 different bluffs all with views of the canyon. No railing so be careful but it gives you a great sense of scope of the park. Pretty shady until you get to the cliff's edge and a decently moderate gain on your way back."", 'Not for those with a fear of heights. Awesome views of the valley but I couldn’t bring myself to get close enough to the edges to really get a good view. There is one railing and the point is very large. Trail is pretty easy up until the very end where the elevation change is a little rough going back once you’re finished. Will definitely do again, I’m thinking for sunrise!', ""If you want one of the best views of the park and to hike one of the most accessible trails, take this hike. The view is absolutely amazing. If you want/can handle a bit more of a challenge, Sentinel Dome is my recommendation, but standing at the edge of a cliff and beholding the fissures of the valley is simply breathtaking. Both Sentinel and Taft make for excellent sunset destinations, the former of which I can personally attest to. If you do one hike on a day trip, this should be it. There's no reason not to. Make it your last activity of the day and the sunset will be the perfect bookend to your visit."", ""Really great view of El Capitan's dawn wall as well as the fissures. A very nice easy 2 mile hike. Easy to do this one with children or people who can hike very easily."", 'This is a super easy to follow trail, leads you directly to Taft Point and is clearly marked the entire way. Be prepared to be winded if you’re not used to the elevation.', 'If there’s one place to go in Yosemite this is it!! Not for the ones afraid of heights as there are no railings and the edge is 4000’ straight down! Most breathtaking place in my opinion!!', 'The best trail in the entire park with incredible views especially at sunset. A quieter place in Yosemite as well if you arrive early or later in the day. Hoping it stays that way! After a long day though, the hike is a little tiring on the way back because of the incline. Still my favorite hike. Would do it over and over again.', 'Easy hike with big payoff of views. Great view of El Capitan.', 'Love this hike! Beautiful view! Bit of a rush to stand near the edge!', 'This may be a short hike, but bring water!', 'Great hike! Not too bad, not much of an incline. Took us 45 mins - 50 mins to get to the edge. Amazing view of the valley and El Capitan! Don’t forget to take a picture to that other edge of the point. Also, be aware and be prepared for mosquitoes along the hike.. Have off lotion/spray handy with you. Wear windbreakers or layered clothing.', 'Great little hike we did with our almost 2 year old. He walked the first 3/4 of a mile and we loaded him into a child carrier backpack for the remainder, mostly because he was tired but also because the fissures posed a risk for his fast, wandering legs and because at that point the trail became steeper and rocky for a short time. The view though was spectacular.', 'Great trail. Fissures are awesome. Very rewarding views at the end. Lots of mosquitoes early today. Bring bug spray.', 'Hiked up for sunset and it was highlight of our trip.', ""It's a nice and easy way to get a good view of the valley. Personnally, I think a lot of view point on this side of the valley are similar, so just do one. Taft might be the easiest. You should probably combine with doing sentinel dome (even if it is a bit dissappointing), the whole loop and finishing/starting at glacier point"", 'Easy hike with huge payoff. I proposed to my now fiancé here with beautiful El Capitan and Yosemite falls in view. Damp ground from snow melt in late April made the trail difficult/fun to navigate. A great oppurtunity to see Yosemite from above the valley floor.', 'Nice easy hike, pretty views from the point.', 'Great view of El Capitan', 'Nice short little, easy hike- the ending is fairly amazing, getting to see the fissures and the dropoff at taft point make the hike!', 'Really easy, shorter hike. Hiked in October and were the only ones on the trail!', 'This is an amazingly wonderful hike. Has great views and a fairly easy/moderate skill level. Shady trees in most spots.', 'We did this hike yesterday. Nervous that it might be too icy/ snowy at this time of year but it was a lovely hike. We hiked up the 4 miles trail & came down this trail. Spectacular day in Yosemite.', 'Beautiful views, but holy anxiety attack!  If you have a fear of heights, skip this trail.  I did a quick peek at the overlook and had to take off. The drop off was crazy!', 'Great walk, tie it up with Sentinal dome', 'Cool place!!', 'Excellent views. My 10 year old daughter did it with no problem.', 'Great views and nice, easy hike through the woods', 'This was a really quick and beautiful spot to enjoy the view of the valley. It was not wheel chair or stroller friendly. And, the mosquitoes were killer during the late afternoon. But overall, we really enjoyed the leisurely one mile walk up and one mile back down. I, especially, thought going closer to sunset was worth it and it was a great way to end the day.', 'Great trail. Beautiful scenery! Easy!', 'Basic words of caution: Keep the younger and/or inexperienced hikers under control at Taft Point. The fissures could easily swallow a mis-behaving or rambunctious child.  Because of this danger factor, along with the rather steep climb back out, I would consider this hike ""moderate"" and not ""easy"" as is claimed by All Trails...  Also, this is a terrific hike when combined with Sentinel Dome via the Pohono Trail along the north rim of Yosemite Valley.  This loop pushes the hike well over 5 miles and adds a couple thousand up-and-down vertical feet.  The views from Sentinel Dome, Taft Point, and all along the Pohono Trail are second to none.  Consider this a must-do if you have a couple days in Yosemite.  Technically the hike is easy, but the altitude, climbing, and 2000 foot cliff will get your attention.  Pohono is basically empty between these two destinations, but you will probably have some company on both ends of your journey.', 'Great vies usually but we were dealing with a ton of smoke from the fires.  Still an amazing hike - highly recomend', ""Nice hike to start your stay in the park or on your last day if you legs are worn out. The trail is flat and takes you through a nice wooded area. At the end it opens up to a large rock service to view some of the valley. Great place to spend some time looking at the different view points. We took the trail that follows the cliff edge to Sentinel Dome instead of going back to the parking area and starting the Sentinel Done trail. Great trail but it isn't well marked. After you cross the creek you turn right to stay on the trail. It looks like there is a trail to the left but it's not the actual trail."", 'Downhill on the way there, a bit more of uphill walking on the way back. I love to go here for the view of El Cap... seriously such a cool place to look at el cap from. From Taft you can also see Yosemite falls and a huge drop of 3,000 feet below you. Show extreme caution around the cliff edges!!', 'Easy and beautiful hike. We went late in the day when parking was easy and there were hardly any people at the point. Beautiful views and nice trees along the way.', 'We started this trail at 7am & there were 5 parked cars already. By the time we finished our hike around 9:30am, the parking lot was full. The trail starts as a decline with an incline all the way back up. It goes through shaded areas with a beautiful scenery all the way to Taft point. I gave this trail a 4 star because its filled of mud and MOSQUITOES! HUGE MOSQUITOES. Bug spray did not work. I suggest going early to take it all in without the crowd. Unbelievably gorgeous! Highlight of my trip.', 'Fun hike , not too hard. Did it with Sentinel Dome.', 'BEAUTIFUL hike. Amazing views at the end, and a very pleasant trail to get there. Fun to combine with Sentinel Dome as well.', 'Trail closed due to snow 30 May 17, so hiked Sentinel instead. Looking forward to a chance to hike in the future.', 'So good!!', 'Fun, easy trail with stunning views.', ""This is more like a pleasant stroll than a hike. But the scenery is beautiful and the payoff at the end is amazing. The views are stunning, and If you have the courage to lay on your stomach and look down over the over hang, to the straight drop below 1000+ ft, it's chilling and definitely worth it."", ""I love this trail! it's so beautiful and not to long. It gives you time to do other things in the valley!"", ""Awesome! Words can't adequately describe the view. Must see for yourself."", ""One of my favorite hikes! If you're feeling daring you can go out onto Taft Point or look over the cliffs to the bottom of the valley. Easy hike, even for people with knee injuries, but it can be rocky in some places. Amazing overlook of Yosemite Valley, I highly recommend this hike!"", ""Breathtaking views of Yosemite Valley. The hike is fairly easy. Even for someone that isn't in shape."", 'Great escape from the Yosemite Valley crowds. Beautiful 1000 foot cliffs.', 'Grate views', 'Arrived at trailhead fairly early, approximately 7:00 AM or shortly thereafter, on the way to the Point we encountered only one group coming back the other direction and no one coming up behind us along the trail.  The majority of the trail takes you through well shaded forest with little to no elevation gain, shortly before you reach Taft Point you will go down a short series of switchbacks, the trail will then become rocky for a short time before again becoming uniform.\nThe views from Taft Point are fantastic; you can see most of the Valley Floor below you, as well as views of Yosemite Falls and the North Rim.  There is a single small railed area approximately 8x4 feet; the rest is completely exposed so if you are afraid of heights you may want to confine yourself to the railed area!\nThe hike to the Point is easy, but the hike back out is not quite as easy, the rocky portion of the trail as well as the switchbacks are probably easy for people who are in great shape, but if you are out of shape and on the larger side like I am, this part will prove to be somewhat of a challenge, though not one that feels insurmountable.  \nThis is definitely a fantastic hike for beginners and experts alike as the views from the Point are well worth the hike, regardless of your skill level!', 'Best to combine this hike and make it a loop to include Sentinel Dome.  Total was about 5.5 miles.', 'This is a very nice trail.  I have taken it before but this time I had the opportunity to take it with children and granndkids.  We all enjoyed it very much.  I asked my oldest grandson (college age) what he liked most about this trip and he selected this and sentinel dome as the high points of our trip.   This is high praise and he has been on many hikes in Rocky mountain and Zion national parks.', 'Great little hike.  Saw some deer on the hike out and a great view at the end. combined this with sentinel dome via the pohono trail', 'This was amazing. Totally underrated. The views were stunning. The point it awesome, really more so to see as you approach. The Fissures were really cool. We combined with Sentinel Dome, taking the trail that goes closest to the cliff. The view at the halfway point was the best of the hike. Oh, and our 5 year old and 2 year old did awesome.', 'hidden gem.  took trail from taft to sentinel dome. well worth it. went on to glacier point. ehhhh crowded and a bit wider view but the peace and tranquility of taft and the trail to sentinel dome is where Yosemite is at her best.', 'This trail is easy, but not when covered in snow. Following footprints just gets you lost. We turned this hike into a big ordeal, but it was worth it when we finally made it to Taft point. We just did a little extra work for some awesome views, worth it!!! We took the correct trail on the way back and it seriously only took ten minutes ', 'This hike is much more challenging when the trail is covered in snow. As others have mentioned, the views are awesome.', 'Short easy hike with huge payoff! Beautiful views. I even stumbled upon some high liners traversing a gap at the top. It made it even more amazing. Do this and sentinel dome for the ultimate array of views.', 'Super beautiful scenery.  Easy hike.', ""This hike offers phenomenal views for relatively minor hiking. We took the trail from the parking lot and the hike was an easy downhill stroll. The views at the end of the trail are nothing short of spectacular. I've never seen a place that has such pure vertical drops of that height. The last step-up before reaching the little rail section reveals a panoramic view of the valley with a great view of El Cap. The only thing it does not offer is a view of Half Dome, but you can get that from Sentinel Dome or Glacier Point. If you have the nerve, take a look over the rail. It almost made me feel paralyzed; stunning.\n\nThis was one of our favorite places in Yosemite and we only came across 10 other hikers, much less congested than the Valley trails. On the way back, we opted to yield to the left and took the Pohono trail to Sentinel Dome for sunset. More and more awesome views. Highly recommended."", ""It was a great, simple hike. Ended my day at Taft Point. It's a great place for views of the West Valley. Looking forward to doing it again soon."", 'Easy hike, great views', 'Wow! My favorite hike in Yosemite.', ""Taft Point is a very easy and short hike with dramatic views at the end. It is family friendly but there are no guard rails (unlike Glacier Point) so keep an eye on kids that tend to wander. However, because it's pretty close to Glacier Point and it's easy it tends to get really crowded. Instead of starting from the trail head parking, I suggest parking at Glacier Point and hiking to Sentinel Dome then to Taft Point. It's a solid day hike and you knock out a few birds with one stone and you keep your parking."", 'Beautiful hike. We went in Oct. and the weather was great.(Hooray for Global Warming!) We combined the Sentinel Dome to Taft Point and the Fissures hikes and it totaled 5.5 miles. The section from Sentinel Dome to Taft point moves in and out of the woods along the south ridge of Yosemite Valley at around 7000 feet give or take. The view of El Capitan and the valley floor is spectacular from this vantage point. Moderate/easy. My  kids hd  no problem completing this and very few people on the section between the two points. Trailhead and parking very crowded though.', 'might be a better view than sentinel and combined the 2 together to make it a loop a total of like 5 miles or so.....great lookout point with stunning views of the valley el cap and the drop off is unreal...', 'it was terrifyingly beautiful. the hike itself is lovely and very mild, but when you come up to the edge of the rock faces going down into the valley it gets significantly steeper. down on taft point there are amazing fissures in the rock that allow you to see for the first time just how high up you are- i cant even..... \n\nthere are multiple spots to look out from, you can see el capitan very very well. terrifying. beautiful. wow.', 'Beautiful view!  easy hike.  Not a good hike if you like less people.', ""Glacier Point without the hand rails.  Great view, easy hike.  If you're brave, you can go all the way to the edge and look over.  Would not recommend taking kids out here for safety reasons.  Spectacular view of El Capitan, Yosemite Falls, and Cathedral Rocks."", ""This is a nice trail that ends with a fantastic view of Yosemite valley. Keep your kids close. There are no guardrails at any of the fissures and only a small one at the point. Even if you aren't afraid of heights, your knees may feel a little shaky near the edge!  A lot of diverse landscape on this short trail. "", 'Amazing views of the valley.  Caution, do not take chilLdren. ', 'Fantastic overnight backpack. Start at McGurk Meadows trailhead, hike to Bridalveil  creek, camp, hike to Fissures, return and hike out. ', 'A fun hike with a amazing knee weakening views that all can enjoy. ', 'Easy. Nice. Shaded. Beautiful views of the valley. ', ""What an easy hike with a giant payoff. The hike to Taft Point is a nice walk through the woods. It had snowed the night before, so there was snow melting from the trees, and everything was spongy and cool. There is a large quartz outcropping along the trail that is interesting. Taft Point has incredible views of the north valley wall, El Cap, and Yosemite Falls, but you have to be careful and use common sense because there are no guard rails except for the one at Taft Point itself. Other than that you are free to stand wherever you want, and it is a LONG way down. The hike back up to the trailhead is where the elevation gain comes in, but it's still fairly easy. While you are here, you should hike over and check out Sentinel Dome, as well. (2.2 miles round trip)"", ""We started from Glacier Point road - there is a parking lot right on the side of the road - and decided first to go to the Sentinel Dome Trail, a great hike! A gradual climb to the base of a giant dome.  On top is a 360-degree spectacular view of Yosemite.  Every feature except El Capitan can be seen.  This was a famous spot for Ansel Adams, whose barren tree stood alone in solitude at the top (and has since fallen on its side).  A good spot for reflection, we pondered awhile and then hiked back to the parking lot.  The parking lot is right in the middle of the two trails about 2.2 mi. RT to Sentinel Dome and about 2.4 mi. RT to Taft Point.  We still had some spunk, so decided to try the Taft Trail to the fissures at Taft Point.  The trail down is easy, but the hike back is a bit harder.   Taft was a scary place, with tubular railings not as safe as the wide rock and rails at Glacier Point.  One unknowing step into a fissure (you could see them if you knew about them) and you are a goner.  I don't recommend children under 7 hiking this trail - maybe there are better railings now than the ones they had in 2000.  The trail back up is a gradual climb, so take water.  When we got back to the car, we headed for the Glacier Point snack and gift shop for hot dogs and sandwiches, a great pit stop.

You may also go up and back along the ridgelines with lots of up and downs.     I sometimes use this park when I go out with people of different skill levels.  I will run two laps while my wife or some friends hike the loop.

A lot if runners.Public bathroom look pretty clean by the parking lot and they do have a portable potty by the south entrance. Overall, a good hike! I like it a lot. About 3-4 hills and one steep ass hill! Omg! I was literally on my hands and knees trying to climb the steep hill. No switchbacks and they do have level trails. It smell real nice with all the trees and plants on one of the cover trails. The trail with hills are out in the open. So, make sure your wear sun screen and have lots of water.  There are benches along the trails with the hills. It took us 2 hours to hike 2 trails; which is a little over 5 miles total.

We did the loop walking down through the slot first and the up the hill and along the ridge on the road. The slot is really fun!', ""Great hike through an amazing landscape. The trail is quite easy to follow once you arrive in the parking lot. The drive up the dusty road from the 78 is easy enough that 4wd is not required at all. A buddy of mine drove up in a Scion XB and had no trouble. Just be mindful of the patchy sand and be sure to stay on the designated road at all times.This hike is well worth the trip.

It had some really nice geological features. Some parts of the slots gets really tight. We had started our hike a little later in the day, but the weather was awesome and the 2nd half of the trail was all shaded. Since the trail is a loop we decided to start the trail from heading West (if facing the slots head left) from the parking. It'll take you through a dirt road (4wd vehicle use this trail too) until you finally hit a steep hill. Go down the hill to the right and head towards the slots. There is a faster option of getting to the slots which is starting at the end and either doing the loop in that direction or turning around at the end of the slots and head back the same way you came in. If you decide to start in reverse remember they're is that steep hill with loose sand you'll have to go up. We found it most rewarding doing it the way we did. But we ran into other hikers that did it in reverse."", ""it was a lot of fun, but not a year round trail. I'd definitely avoid this place in the summer.  the description saying it's shaded and cool is inaccurate; most of the trail,even inside the canyon, is in the full brunt of the sun.The trail starts out on sandstone hills, then declines gradually into the slot canyon.  once inside, the trail is extremely narrow. I could barely fit through with my day pack on.  my husband wouldn't be able to fit through most of the trail as he's a big guy, and I was scraping my legs and arms on the walls as I passed.Fortunately, the views inside the canyon make it totally worth it.  It was even worth the heat!  Would be a beautiful hike in the winter or spring, when the sun isn't so hot."", 'Go early in the morning if you can to avoid the high heat.  It is a fairly easy hike.  The areas through the slot are not very big.

The entrance from the highway is small and the road to the parking lot is sand packed one-way track with turn outs. We (3 adults and 3 kids (9-11 years old) did this easy hike and it was fantastic. Warning: there are some areas where it is more suited for slender body types and wearing a backpack (even a small one) can be a little tight. It's a nice short hike and pretty relaxed. We did this at the end of the day and by the time we came up we caught the sunset"", '', 'Walked the Slot in February and found it to by a nice hike with interesting scenery in the canyon with narrow as well as wide walled areas. We did not know it looped and did not have our AllTrails app so our hike was short, but it was nice. I wore a pack on this one, and some spots can be tight to squeeze through with a pack.', 'Great little trail. Getting in at the trail head might be tough for those that require a cane to walk, it gets pretty skinny at times but awesome fun. The trail can go much farther than is listed if you want to.

I did see Seniors (one 80+) doing the trail. People of all ages, shapes, and sizes were hiking this trail seemingly without a problem. The only hindrance would be if you needed a cane or something to assist with walking. Otherwise, you're good to go. Bring water, as always.

The map shows a loop but we kind of got lost once we got out of the slot canyon section so we turned around as it was dusk. It's really cool down there. Highly recommended."", 'Very easy hiking & what a very amazing view. I love it ', 'a great day,,,anyone can do this,  easy drive to trailhead, any car!', ""What a cool experience. It's a short hike so we hiked in from the main road. We wore our day packs, but if you can wear a smaller pack, it's easier to squeeze through the slot. Great photos ops and beautiful sights. The trail opens up after the slot and you'll notice that if you go straight there are rocks cutting off the trail.... that's the Jeep trail. There is a sharp right turn that you can take, which has many cool areas to see, but it does dead end. You can climb out at the dead end, however you cannot get back to the car lot since it doesn't connect. At that point, you can just turn back and return the same way you came."", 'Oh Wow!! what a place.. we unfortunately started on wrong side and we went to the hawk mountain but on our way back, we finally found the canyon.. A bit confusing to find where does start the trail..', 'Wow and wow!! What a nice hike, once you found it... We started to follow the trail at the post sign then, gone below as per the trail brings us. But at this point(down below) there are no signs to whether turn right or left. We unfortunately turned right, we passed a small canyon(thought that was the slot) and started to climb(we were disappointed since we thought that was the slot that we have passed), anyways we loved the hike we did in the mountain.... Returning back, at the point where we had to climb to reach the parking lot, we have decided to continue!! Oh My God, the slot was there!!! What a place!!!So, once you are down in the canyon, pls turn left to not miss it!!', ""Was there just a couple days ago. Such an amazing place! There was a good amount of people there enjoying it, but it wasn't at all crowded."", 'Very interesting hike! The canyon gets pretty deep at some points and there are tons of ledges that you can climb onto which is a plus since I enjoy bouldering. Definitely worth it to also check out the visitor center and learn more about what caused the slot area to form.', 'Beautiful and amazing! As described,  there\'s a short scramble down a rocky path to get to the trail. Did not keep going around the ""loop"" as it seemed the road just went on and on. turned back and walked through the slot again and walked right past the trail ò to the parking lot.  oops. figured it out eventually. highly recommend this hike.', ""An amazing spot to visit if you're in Anza, especially if it's the summer time and you want to escape some of the heat. The trail is easy/impossible to stray from and there's a parking area at the trailhead. I've seen alot of people confused after parking when trying to find out how to start it. So when you park facing the canyon, go to the right up a small hill and then turn left down into the canyon. DO NOT try an adventure when there's been rain or a chance of a flood coming, the trail is narrow, hence the name. And to be blunt, if you're a bigger person, you may have some problems when it gets tight. Besides that it's the best hike for kids or a simple walk close to Borrego Springs."", 'amazing!!!', 'One of the coolest trails in So cal', ""The hike is really short and easy but it's incredible.

Easy to miss the Buttes Pass road from 78, and a bit rough to get to the trail head, but once you are there - boy! This is it!\n\nThe trail is very easy - yes there are narrow passages but even a slightly large person can easily fit in. Not much elevation or anything strenuous, just a nice and easy walk. You will be amazed and awestruck with this canyon in the middle nowhere."", 'You drive down a dirt road for a little over a mile before getting to the parking lot.

Some spots were pretty narrow. Definitely check the weather, in case of flash floods. Easy hike though getting in and out of the canyon is a little hard.', ""GSP coordinates:  33.182132, -116.214176\nThe Slot Canyon out near Borrego Springs is one of the only ones  of it's kind in the area.  It is a great hike and very easy to find despite what folks always seem to write up about it.\n\nIf you are coming from Julian directly, stay on Hwy 78 and go pass Borrego Springs Road, the road you are looking for is Buttes Pass Road which is just a mile or so pass the turn for Borrego Springs Rd.  If coming out of Borrego Springs, use Borrego Springs Road directly and link up with the 78, turning east towards Ocotillo Wells, again heading east till you see the sign for Buttes Pass.  I think the trick is not missing the small brown signs that are used to denote the park roads as they are easy to miss.\n\nThe road is improved gravel, so you shouldn't need a 4x4, but stay on the trail and as long as your vehicle has pretty good ground clearance you should shouldn't have to worry about getting stuck.  I made the mistake of turning off on the wrong trail the first time out there in my car and got stuck.  It is very easy to do and can be dangerous given the right conditions.\n\nButtes Pass Road splits just a short ways in and heads slightly east to Goat Trail, continue northward towards Borrego Mountain Wash.  After a good half mile or so, you will come to a wide parking area.\n\nPlease note, the road goes on further but you will need a 4x4 very quickly once you continue from this point onward pass the Slot Canyon parking so only do it if you have one.\n\nThe initial climb down into the canyon is steep, but not that bad if you go slow and pay attention to your footing.  And as with all canyons like this, the temperature is a good 10 - 15 degrees cooler down inside the canyon than at the surface which is nice, but still make sure that you bring plenty of water and your standard hiking gear (good shoes and a hat are a must).\n\nThe canyon can be narrow in areas and you might have to take off your backpack if your wearing one.  Overall, it's a great hike.  One that you should see at various times with the light: morning, mid day, and evening.  It's simply gorgeous.\n\nBe safe, make sure someone knows where you are and take someone with you.  I don't mean to sound preachy, but folks who have never been out in the heat sometimes read these posts then they head out to do the hikes and they can get themselves into trouble if they are not prepared - that desert can get super hot.  It always makes me very sad when I read about accidents like that and I hate seeing it happen.\n\nHave fun."", ""Always worth the time - hop over and knock this one out as you're passing through the area.  Each of the two dozen trips, I've always wondered if it's my time... Thrilling for the kid-o's. Take the dirt road out, park where you can see that everyone else does, and scoot down into the slot and follow the footsteps.  It's exists from nature's power - watch the skies before you go."", 'Really enjoy this hike. Not difficult or much of a work out but interesting and fun. Getting down into the slot area is basically scambling down a gravelly slope so not great for anyone not sure footed but its not too steep.  At one point it gets narrow enough that you have to walk sideways. Definitely bring water! To get to the parking area, you are ok if not 4wd when dry.\nRoad is unpaved and the sign is very small and easy to miss.', ""Great little gem, we heard about this place while camping in Anza, Thought we'd check it out.  Awesome! The idea of getting lost in there, kinda kewl lol. A must do hike."", ""Very cool hike. I have an iPhone and used the directions link which worked perfectly, however I didn't see a trail head sign at all. When you arrive you'll see cars parked facing the slot. On the far right side of the parking area you'll see a line of rocks. Follow that trail up a hill. The trail will split, stay to your left. That will drop you down into the canyon. Also I recommend not driving a vehicle that sits low to the ground. I bottomed out my A3 several times."", 'Fun, short hike. Took both my dogs with me, didn\'t see the tiny ""no dogs"" sign at the trail head until I got back to my truck; didn\'t run into any problems having them there.', 'Pretty awesome, simply put. It\'s worth a stop, walk, and some photo ops.

To beat the heat we started our hike just after sunrise. We were done by 0930 and traveled east to Niland, CA for some sightseeing. We brought our dogs, but there were ""No Dog"" signs. We took our chances and didn\'t run into any problems.\n\nI hope this helps, I used the map on the link above and our GPS had \'Buttes Pass Road\' on it.

Beautiful views! Steep hills that were a welcome challenge. We had a great time! As someone else mentioned, watch for dog poop.', 'Such a fun and challenging hike/trail run. Great workout and nobody on the mountain!', 'There were a few spots on the hike where the paths veered in different directions, and you had to find your way. We ended up going up one path and going down a completely different one. I really enjoyed the small cave we found too. Not sure how far it goes but if you crawl in, it opens up a lot. The views were panoramic from any direction. Definitely a great hike!', 'Good workout for sure. Took about 3 hours with a few breaks throughout. The trail terrain changes quite a bit from dirt, to moss, to rocks. Definitely wear good shoes. Didn’t think the views were outstanding. Don’t think I would hike this again.', 'Was able to hike this in 3 hours including lots of rest breaks. I am not an experienced hiker and very sensitive to the heat. Really good challenge and cool to see the caves. Lots of dog and coyote scat on the trail.', 'Good trail and easy to follow. Bring plenty of water and use sunscreen during the summer. Had my 4 kids with me (10 and under) and they were able to get to the top. It was definitely hot with minimal coverage, I’d like to do it again once it’s cooled down a bit. The views were worth the climb. The distance is a little off, it says it is 4.6 miles but we went 5.41 miles total.', 'Typical SoCal hike. Good workout and accurate distance. There are a few nice lookout points but for the most part it is an uncovered grind to the peak. We went in the early afternoon on a sunny day in June and it was HOT. No tree coverage but based on other reviews did not expect any. A solid hike and close to San Diego which is a plus.', ""What can I say, this is a fun hike! The caves are so cool to see and u don't even think about the difficulty of the trail because of all there is to see! Beautiful views from the peak as well!"", 'Fun but harder hike, took kids and dogs and they were good!', 'it\'s quite the lower body burn for the first mile or so and then again, intermittently on the path. there are a few splits in the road that are not marked but you can figure it out relatively easily as the alternate ""paths"" don\'t really lead anywhere. you pass some huge homes, compounds really, so you don\'t really feel like it\'s a hike until you are near the top and the homes are in the distance. not as ""scenic"" as I\'d hoped from prior reviews but after doing Corte Madeira in Cleveland National Forrest, there\'s not much that I would be wowed by. there are a lot of loose rocks so stick to the surfaces that look most traveled as they are the most secure. took us 2 hours because the first 20-30 minutes is super challenging. use this as a workout and you will love it. using it as a scenic experience, not really. we saw a total of 5 people so it\'s perfect for going at whatever pace you want.', 'Beautiful views along with my pup and I getting quite a workout with the steep hills. Parking was good and there was barely anyone there. With that being said, we encountered a rattlesnake towards the end of our hike (we’re fine!) just make sure you’re aware of your surroundings!', 'Very steep in parts and lots of loose rocks and gravel underfoot so be careful. Views from the top are fabulous', 'Enjoyable views with a good workout on the way up.', ""The views were beautiful, and I went mid week when there wasn't anyone else on the trail. It was however very hot, and there is no shade along the trail. Be ready to be climbing a lot, and not feeling like there's much play-off. It was fine for the experience, but I wouldn't go again."", 'Great hike, did the round trip in about 1hr 45min.  Definitely bring some water with you, it was heating up at about 11am when I was on my way back and I was glad I was able to drink some water while I was at the top.  Amazing views from the top, even saw a Coast Guard helicopter flying around below me.  \n\nKeep your eyes on the trail, I was distracted by the view and came within a couple feet of a rattlesnake crossing the path, I just backed away slowly and gave him the right of way.', 'Excellent, challenging with a good, somewhat flat break and wonderful views from the top', 'Fun hike.', 'This was my first time doing this trail and It wasn’t that bad. It took me about 2 hours to do it.. The views were amazing!! I saw the sunset on my way down and couldn’t stop taking pictures. I highly recommend this trail.', 'Had a fun hike with the family and dog. Amazing views to the ocean', ""It's a tough climb but worth it"", 'This was a great hike. There is a lot of dog / coyote poop on the trail so watch out. The beggining is overgrown. Make sure to do this hike in cool weather as there is not much shade. The inclines towards the end get pretty steep and are very rewarding at the end. Some amazing views from the top. It is kind of a bummer though that there is no sign when you get to the top! While it was very enjoyable I am not sure that I will be back anytime soon.', ""This was an awesome hike. Very little people are on this trail, and it feels like an adventure not seeing the peak right away. There's a false peek which consist of steep switchbacks. From there, you'll cross over some saddles before getting to the bottom of the final ascent. The view was incredible, and I even found a rock that was shaped like a chair making it perfect for snack time while overlooking San Diego"", 'Ok I’m a pretty good hiker I’d say. This was more difficult then I thought. It is noted to be moderate but I believe it to be more difficult than moderate. The trail wasn’t occupied at all during our hike. This was on a Sunday morning starting at 6:30 AM. It ended 2 1/2 hours later. Beautiful views. The caves are cool . I’d tell you we’re to find them but that’s the adventure. Goonies “never say die” . Ha I was bummed there was no markers or signs but hey it was a fun hike and the caves are super cool.', 'Had never heard of this trail but was pleasantly surprised by the great views. Best to go early morning as you lose shade after 10am. Not too crowded yet not too far away the city.', ""Do NOT leave items visible in your car - my friend left her backpack in the backseat of my car, and someone performed a quick smash-and-grab. I came back to a broken window and her bag stolen. I talked to a local, who said it unfortunately happens often at the trailhead.\n\nHike itself is alright. There's no airflow in the beginning, so it feels pretty hot. I would not recommend this hike for a warm day."", 'It was an ok hike. Great views. would be great as a training hike. just enough steep parts to keep it challenging.', 'Cool hike up. Wish there were ways to get into the mines.  Great views on top', 'Very fun hike. Highly recommend going early', 'I’d label this trail more difficult than moderate.  The majority is a straight uphill hike that zig-zags up the mountain.  Most views are clear sights of East County hills and secluded homes along the mountain. The paths are narrow and steep which can be tricky for passing other hikers.  The top of the summit is nothing special, but overall a fun hike.  Good distance and elevation- would recommend to anyone', 'Not sure if it was because of the heat or the climb but I found this hike to be pretty difficult! There is a short flat section as you hike along the ridge line but the rest of the 2.4 miles to the summit is a fairly steep climb. There is only one or two shade spots so be safe, wear a hat, take it slow in heat, and bring lots of water.', 'Great views from the top perch including Palomar to the north, Cuyamaca to the east, and Otay to the south. Nice cooling breeze after moderate climbing. Easy to lose the main trail but also easy to find it again. Trail surface kind of hard for the most part. Lighly travelled, even on a Saturday.', 'Moderate hike, more than half the hike is usually exposed to the sun so go early. Good views from the top. Moderate traffic as well.', 'Nice views!', 'Trail is very confusing as there lots of switchbacks. There were trail signs in the beginning but then disappear in the middle  where it got confusing. Lots of forks and the map seems outdated.', 'Fun little trail', 'We were there early! Trail is very well marked with several flyers and chalk arrows on trail. There is no shade so make sure take hat and plenty of sunscreen. We did the round trip in an hour and 15 minutes. Take plenty of water as it can get really hot once sun is beaming!', ""Started this trek at 7am on a foggy Saturday. Not too much parking space available, but it doesn't seem like this particular trail in the mountain is popular. \n\nThis is a moderate hike at most featuring some rocky terrain and switchbacks early on. At about 1 mile in there's a divergence in the path. The right side takes you to an overlook, but this morning was so hazy we could not see anything properly. This same area has a mineshaft. After much debate with having to crawl in I decided to do it anyways. It goes back about 50 ft before you hit a cave in. Though there looks to be a continued path following the debris, I wouldn't recommend going further without a hard hat. \n\nThe continued path features some rough hills. There's a couple of random trail that seems like the right way but just leads nowhere, have a map handy to avoid this. You will have to do some mild rock scrambling to get to this mountain's peak. Again, with it being so early we couldn't get in any good views. But I'm still glad we chose to hike through the fog. By 10 during the descent, the sun was out and ready to burn us to a crisp!"", 'It was a good hike. But need to be ready to do some moderate exercise.', ""Awesome hidden gem out in east county. One of the most enjoyable hikes I've been on in a while. There's a part of it where you will need to look at your GPS, otherwise the trail gets a little hard to follow. We made it down just in time before the sun completely set. Only saw 4 other people on the entire trail. Great workout!"", 'Nice little trail,pretty views', 'It was a moderate to strenuous hike but so worth it. Only thing missing is the marker for the top.', 'It was a good day to hike. Not crowded. Family and had a great time.', ""Great trail with some signs, it keeps leading to different peaks, I think I ended at the right one/the highest peak I saw. The first peak or two you hit you might think you're done but keep going! Very rocky at some points- cool large rocks to climb on. I might have gotten lost coming back if I was alone cause some parts you don't see a trail too well, we saw 4 people during the whole hike which is pretty awesome. Good workout not too steep"", ""I really liked the trail, but had a hard time actually discerning the summit. Unless I didn't 'hit it', it's just a tiny rocky area with NO summit/elevation sign. I also was a bit skiddish with the very narrow trails in the beginning, I so wanted to cut all that brush off so I could have a better view if any snakes were to be near.

That said, I did really enjoy this trail. Lots of incredible views and wildflowers. There were a few parts where discerning the trail was a bit difficult as there are a few forks, and it\'s true that the area has lots of houses which can maybe take you out of the ""nature/wilderness"" mindset. The views were incredible though, and I would love to do this trail again... without the baby.', 'First time out today.

I drained the last of it on the way back and was glad to have several more gallons waiting for me at the trailhead.

I approached from Jamul Road then up the designated trail. If your biking, 60% is hike-a-bike if your a weekend warrior. I descended to the golf course, eventually. To exit, you must travel on private property and the golf course. So, be respectful and perhaps travel in small groups. Overall, the descent is one of the best in San Diego with two 3 mile sections with the lover section being more developed and the upper being rocky and very bushy."", 'Great view from the top. Took me almost 2.5 hours to complete.', 'Absolutely recommend this trail. Evenly dispersed steep areas throughout the trail with rest areas alike, makes it a very enjoyable hike. Filled with different views of Jamul, the climate changes throughout the hike also makes it one of my favorite relaxing spots in San Diego. With very little people ever around, it makes it a good area to get away from the crowds and get in sync with your thoughts. There is also a small cave you see once you are close to the top that I am definitely checking out on my next hike.', 'This is a nice one. Clearly marked with super cute markers.

I believe the distance given is a little shorter than the actual route length. My GPS indicated approximately 4.7 miles out and back. I agree with the difficulty rating. Moderate is accurate. There are some eroded areas where people have short-cut the trail (such as right at the first mine) straight up/down. This makes for very difficult footing. If all people would use the proper route, the trail is no harder than moderate, and is only that hard because of its length.', 'I would definitely not call this hike easy! Pretty steep and rocky.

It was cool seeing the quite few mine shafts through out the trail on the way to the top. The trail is bad but can get tricky coming back down due to turns if your not paying attention to your route.

I thought I was at the ""top"" and found a cave and I was like no way this was too easy. Go around a corner and there is another incline which is fine. Rinse, repeat a few times and you are at the top. Met someone there who said there is supposed to be a memorial or some kind of sign but there wasn\'t. Besides that, this trail is mostly dirt. I do prefer green with more wildlife and that is why this is given a 3 star but this is just a personal opinion, if you prefer this scenery like my friend, this hike can be at the top of your list.', ""Did this hike the first week in October and the temperature was just right with a wonderful breeze so it wasn't too warm.

The switch backs on the first peak was good, then after slightly flat until you pass the red top house and start making your ascend upwards to the Peak.  Then the following week on Jan 19, 2015 I got invited by some friends to hike the mountain from the eastern side.  This was cool, but longer and steeper from the western side.  After reaching the abandon house, which was very cool, the next 2-plus to the Peak was all UPHILL.  This was reminiscence of Mighty El Cajon/El Capitan hike.  For a minute or so, I did not think the end was near from the uphill, but I accomplished the summit and found (2nd attempt) the hiking jackpot, the Peak Log.

Its not too far away and it was not crowded. I can honestly say I saw more animals than people (quail and deer) and thats hard to say about a hike in San Diego.', ""Great Hike!!!!

I hike this often and it will always be in my top 5!"", ""Great hike.....a little more then we anticipated in length and incline. Trail head is off Jamul, there's a little dirt parking lot.

This trail reminded me how out of shape I am. The first 3/4 mile is a steady ascent then it plateaus for half a mile or so. You start climbing again with several steep slopes for another mile.

The trailhead is off of jamul drive not peg leg road, which is where the driving directions on the app take you. There is a small parking lot which was empty on a Sunday afternoon.

The whole out portion is majority uphill. Incredible views at the end made it worth it. It also averages at about 6 miles from the starting point this sets you at just FYI. We took a couple side routes to look out points that contributed to that', 'Came here on Dec 30th around 11:30am and it was easy to find parking on the residential area. Maybe it was because of the holidays that parking was easy to find. The trail was easy to find. It was a clear paved path the entire way up and down. You start off with a slight incline and keep working your way up. The incline is nothing too crazy anyone can do it, just keep at your steady pace and breathe. The trail will continue to incline and about .5 miles in flattens out. The view at the top is beautiful and coming back down you get the entire city and ocean view. Definitely would come back again!', 'I came on dec 19, 2018, it was a Wednesday so not many people were around. Parking was relatively easy but I can imagine it hard during weekends (the starting point is in a fancy residentialarea on a uphill road, and you can only park alone the street in certain area.) The first 1/4 of the rout could be a little bit intense for people who haven’t worked out much, because it started uphill right away and could be steep sometimes. Fortunately, the trail was wide and no steps or obstacles, and there were a few stopping points for photos and resting.After has its quite easy, and you would ready the midpoint (the tip). It had a great view of LA and oceans, and two benches!! (I thought that was rare.) This is a fantastic choice because one can see mountains, skylines, and ocean all at once. Also there’s a diversity of Californian native plants and various birds chirping and hopping around. Highly recommended!', '', 'Moderate climb to a steady hike. Quite busy. Go early!', 'Great hike!', 'Steady incline and amazing views of the ocean! Not very shaded but good for an overcast day', 'Clocked in about 5.6 miles on this one. Beautiful views on this trail, similar to other trails in the area. Starts out with a good incline for about 1.5 miles then somewhat levels out until you hit the summit (past the bathroom/trash cans). There are a couple of benches at the summit to enjoy the view of the coast and downtown. The trail itself is fairly wide, and very exposed with little to no shade. This is a popular local trail so it\'s heavily trafficked, and as traildummies.com says:  ""like the 405 - it is so crowded nobody expects you to talk to them."" Parking is on the residential street only, I was able to find plenty of open parking on a Sunday morning, but I heard it gets pretty hard to find parking on the weekends.', 'I love this trail and as a local I go at least twice a month. In the summer you should definitely start as early as possible because there is little to no shade. It’s a beautiful view of the ocean with lots of wild flowers along the way. As someone hiking alone occasionally you can walk alone but have someone walk by every couple minutes.', 'Great views of ocean and canyons.  Wide paths for hikers and bikes.  Trip out is mostly uphill and return trip mostly downhill.  No parking at trailhead, need to park on residential street leading to trailhead which can be very limited at times.', 'Love this hike! Greta views and a nice amount of incline to wake your body up. It’s one of my go too. I prefer going early when it’s quieter and just locals and a few early risers but it’s a great hike regardless. Parking can be tough but I just think of it as another part of the hike.', 'This is a nice hike of moderate difficulty but be aware that on the weekends its almost impossible to find parking unless you come very early. I have had to leave before due to no parking! Otherwise it has pretty pacific coast views, it links up with the los liones canyon hike as well, which is longer and a bit less trafficked', ""This was a nice moderate hike. The trail path is easy to follow and the views are great. It's somewhat of a standard Santa Monica Mountains/Pacific Palisades trail. The more I go to these different trails the more that I realize that many of them connect and for me the journey a lot of times is just seeing where the path takes me. The views are essentially the same but from higher vistas and deeper into the mountains you see things that give each their own character. I've been to Los Liones trail and relatively speaking this is a little easier. Apparently they connect at some point. It's a gradual climb, but can be moderately difficult at the beginning. There isn't any shade so be prepared if you go on a sunny day. You'll see a lot of lizards and there are signs that warn of rattlesnakes. This trail is not pet friendly and I wouldn't take a young child too far because of the initial climb and lack of shade. I can say that on this particular day there was a decent amount people on the path. I imagine it being busier when the sun is out and the sky is clear. I ended up taking this to the Parker Mesa Overlook and it was highlight of the trek up. Whether it's Temescal, Los Liones or any trail within the Santa Monica Mountains/Will Rogers Park area you'll be greeted with some great views. The journey, scenery and curiosity alway propels me up to see something special. The remainder of the hike to that point was relatively easy but also started to seem redundant because you didn't know when it would end but once I got there it was worth it. This is a nice hike with some beautiful views and I can't wait to get back on a clearer day."", '', 'It has beautiful views. It is heavily trafficked though.', 'This was a pretty enjoyable hike with a beautiful view at the end. The path is very wide and well maintained. I would say it’s somewhere on the upper end of “easy”/low end of “moderate” as far as difficulty goes. It’s a gradual incline most of the way to the overlook. Bring lots of water and sunscreen because there is very little shade and it can get hot. Parking in the neighborhood is limited, so if it’s a busy day it might be hard to find a spot near the trail head.', 'Beautiful, relatively chill trail for an afternoon walk! It was completely foggy so the views weren’t as expansive as we hoped, but being up in the clouds was a magical experience in its own right. Completed in about 2.5 hours with some time spent up top.', 'Best Ever. Really. Best Hike Ever!', 'Fantastic sunrise hike', 'This was a pretty straightforward trail that was a steady 2.5 mile incline until the very top.  I’d definitely consider it moderate.  Would be a great trail for running as well.  The top is a great view of the city and ocean with a couple benches to enjoy the lookout.  There’s also a legit porta-potty as well up top.  Still, this germaphobe wouldn’t use it.  Parking was tough along the residential area.  Very little shade if it’s sunny.  Trail is shared with mountain bikers.  I did notice that fellow hikers were not as friendly as I’ve experienced on other trails.', 'What a view ', 'Amazing views the entire trail, final outlook was beautiful. I was able to park on the street adjacent to the trailhead. Got there at 7am on a Wednesday and there were already a few cars. Not a ton of street parking available so you can consider the Los Liones parking area and then hiking up if later in the day. There is no lot here. Saw about a dozen people on trail, more later in the day. Took me a little longer than 2 hours round trip with some time spent at the top. The entire approach is a steady incline uphill. Not much shade if sunny, bring sunscreen and water! I saw some neat wildlife on the trail, birds rabbits and a small snake.', 'very accessible from west LA. but busy on a Sunday afternoon, much warmer and more sun than expected. bring water and hat.', 'l love trail with amazing ocean view.', 'Hot but a great hike! Amazing views of downtown, the ocean and Catalina. Bring lots of water with you.', ""This isn't really a hiking trail. With the exception of the final 1/8th mile, you could probably drive a Civic up to the top because the trail is so wide and the incline is pretty constant and gradual. \n\nIt was crowded, even on a Thursday evening. I passed about 30 people in two hours. There are sidewalks in LA with less foot traffic. The crowd and the road-like conditions made the climb feel very un-hike-ish. The views were great though."", 'Best done on a clear day when the views are truly to die for. Beware the lack of shade on a warm day. And the street parking can be trying on a crowded day. Otherwise, one of my fave coastal trails.', 'Great exercise. No shade. Nice breeze most times. Bathroom on top. Fantastic views.', ""Great views on this hike from beginning to end and very easy to follow trail.  The only reason I didn't give five stars is because it's too busy, so go early. Park on the street and enter beside the White House at the dead end."", 'very pretty, great after work hike.', ""I've done this a few times and it's a great workout. Steady incline for the first 2 miles with not much shade. Views at the top and going back down are stunning.  Also, they were installing a restroom at the top."", 'This is on the more challenging end of moderate! There are pretty consistent up and down both out and back. So I would recommend this for someone with a few hikes under their belt or that is relatively activ. Unbeatable views are a good pay off for the hard work. Nice clean trail, beware parking is limited. \n\nwww.meetup.com/Black-Girls-Hike/', 'Pretty solid incline for the first 2miles; would consider it on the harder side of ""moderate"". Views on the downhill trek are fantastic!', ""Trail was great: pretty well maintained, easy to follow.  The first half is a steady incline so get ready to sweat.  The view is worth it!  Parking is tricky; it's only street parking and it is limited.  I would recommend getting dropped off or going early."", 'great morning hike with beautiful views of LA and the ocean! Gradual uphill the majority of the way in is a good work out. Recommend doing the hike early to avoid the heat.', ""So intense! if you're looking for a relentless incline hike with gorgeous panoramic views, this is it. Prepare to work up a major sweat!"", 'Great view.', 'Beautiful view. Nice trail. All around good time.  Love it!', 'Loved this trail! It was terrible going up but once you saw that view, all your work leading up to the top was all worth it!!', ""Great glute workout. If you don't have the time to do the full Los Liones trail, this is a great alternative."", 'beautiful view. not too strenuous for me but very pleasant and my beginner parents did it in 3 hours total! good times', 'Pretty tough at the beginning - straight up for about a mile or more. Missed the best views today though due to fog. Good workout though!', 'Awesome view at the end. Worth it.', 'Spectacular views most of the way up. The terrain is uniform and easy to navigate, but the incline is consistent. It is essentially a dirt road to the lookout. Pretty busy as well, lots of people. Definitely not a good trail if you are looking for peace and quiet. But the view of the coast is awesome.', 'Great walk and gorgeous views of the city. Pretty easy hike and a nice start to the weekend.', ""Great walk with beautiful views. The fire road is well maintained and there wasn't much traffic which made the day great. I would definitely recommend this."", ""I wouldn't call this much of a hike, it's a large (fire road maybe). It's a steady incline and a good work out, does have great views. Lots of people and no shade, very hot!"", ""my first trail from this app!!!!!....it was a bit steep but manageable for my first hike since summer...I can't wait to do more;)"", 'Consistent grade on a well-maintained fire road with an ascent that yields increasingly beautiful views of city, mountain, and ocean that reveal themselves with each turn.', 'My favorite so far.', 'Great views on this hike; see all of LA and down to Catalina, then up to Malibu, just great ocean views. Trail was not to hard but it was hot on the day we went. Highly recommend if you in the la or Santa Monica area as it is very close and a lot of fun.', ""Beautiful view right from the beginning. It definitely feels like a constant incline, but it's a great workout!"", 'nice little challenge. beautiful views at all parts of the trail. not too many people.', 'One of my favorite hikes in LA.', ""This is one of my favorite hikes! It's challenging and the view from the vantage point is incredible!"", 'The constant incline was a great way to get the heart pumping and the muscles working. And the view coming down is gorgeous. Get there early to take advantage of free street parking. Enjoy.', 'Steph thought it was difficult.. I like the views on this one.. We got in a fight :)', 'Beautiful hike, nice workout. Good incline', 'Nice views. We should have come earlier in the day though. Today was particularly hot for the inclined trail.', 'Great hike for everybody. Nice view on top. Hard to find a parking spot at the beginning. Even saw two tv stars;)', 'Steady up hill. Great workout and ocean views', ""There were a lot of locals doing this trail without breaking a sweat; they didn't carry water and wore just everyday workout clothes as they speed-walked to the top and came right back down. I, however, had a bit more of a difficult time. The ascent was rough and I was a bit slow-going but the trail is wide enough that I didn't have to worry about blocking anyone's path. Once we reached the outlook, the view was well worth the trek. It was so beautiful and it was so awesome seeing LA from a different perspective. Overall it took us 1hr 45mins to complete. Highly recommend this!"", ""Beautiful hike! It's a bit of an uphill hike. There is a nice breeze and the views are gorgeous. No dogs are allowed."", 'you get a full work out. nice breeze and the only downside is the parking.', 'Gorgeous views, nice breeze, uphill first half most of the way so great to get the heart rate up. Careful w slipping walking back down hill or with loose rocks. New fave spot!', 'Such great views of downtown skyline to Santa Monica pier to Malibu love the hike!', 'Very good workout.', 'Great hike, with even greater views. Mostly sun, so bring water.', 'Amazing trail. A true hidden gem in LA!', 'Beautiful.', ""Pretty view of the ocean at the top. It's just a fire road hike."", ""This is the only option for Large groups as the fire road is wide enough for a bigger crowd. Los Liones is good for individuals and at the most groups of 4 because the pathway is very narrow, (easy to pass much slower folks) majority of the people come to workout as it's quite strenuous and mystical. ✌"", ""Parking is the only downside to this moderately difficult, steep trail with gorgeous 360 views. You may have to park further down from the trail and hike up - watch for cars.It's hard to know where exactly the trail ends, as there are no signs once you pass the trailhead. Never fear, the path is well defined and the other hikers are friendly :)Head down to the beach afterward to cool off and relax!"", 'Beautiful views!  It was overcast/cloudy but the hike was still worth it.  The parking situation sucked - you have to really hunt for a place to park in this residential neighborhood.', 'Dont like the parking options at this trailhead and prefer the ample parking available at the Los Liones Trailhead.  Starting from here makes the hike shorter and easier, but I think you miss the best part of the hike on the single track from Los Liones.', ""Did this trail the other day on a foggy by the ocean day and it was spectacular and clear by the time we got to the lookout.  We were able to see Mt. WIlson, Downtown LA, Century City, the Santa Moncia coast to Palos Verdes, Catalina Island (and the island beyond Catalina) There isn't much shade but there's a nice ocean breeze from time to time. Saw quite a few hikers coming and going. "", ""This is the Friday night hike of the local Sierra Club. Great incline with ridge trails for a greater workout.  The hike looks different every time you are in it due to the proximity to the ocean mixed with panoramic views of the LA skyline. I've seen rattlesnakes and lizards on this trail. So beware in the late afternoon. But they are very easy to spot. Also have seen quail, glow worms and stink bugs."", ""Pretty good elevation. Beautiful views of the ocean, hills and the city. Last Friday I spotted an owl. I've hiked these hills often for the last 2 years. It was a first time I saw an owl. Dear is very common and watch out for the snakes, as anywhere in Southern Cali - Pacific Rattle snakes are common here. \nPlease don't leave the trace. \n\nBring your sandwich, but leave nothing behind.

That part of the trail is relatively flat so great for all ages biking, strollers or wheel chairs. If you want something more rugged there are side trails with good elevation climbs and rougher terrain. There are portable toilets at the trail head as well as a couple miles out on the path. This place has a little something for everybody. We came across the Park Rangers a few times which leads me to believe this is a relatively safe and well maintained area.

From the very beginning the trail offers a beautiful scenery of the ocean and beautifully designed houses that inspire me on what I would want someday.  The trails have varying ranges of difficulty and also different types of scenery. When you start off you're on a hill where you can peer down into the valley on one side or towards the ocean on the other. As you travel you the trail transitions from rocky passage, to woodland passage. Afterwards you come to following a river until you finally come to open meadows.

Not a lot of cover though while you are walking along the ridge. You have to get down into canyon to find trees. Some trails allow dogs other don't so do your research if that is what you are going for.

Once I hit the ridge (top of the world park), I sometimes take the trail towards AlisoWoods       via car wreck, Rockit, Mathis or Lynx. Other days I go towards Downtown laguna (I call my urban hike/trail run) down park ave, thru neighborhood, drop into farmers market on Saturday morning & run back up Laguna canyon for an 8-9mi loop.  There is much to explore in these hills, don't be afraid to wander & change it up! You'll find caves, gorgeous rock formations, a creek, deer, and many other things. "", ""Very fun trail.  Starts with a nice series of uphills to get the pace set for a good hike.  However the starting main trail can become a little dull but the offshoot trails specifically down into the canyon around the caves are great.  Spotted and explored what looked to be a freshly lived in cave lower down in the canyon well worth the extra effort getting to it.  All in all it's a nice hike but don't judge it by the initial trek out."", ""Just did this trail and had a blast! It takes a while to get to the trail but once you get there it is really fun. The trail is fairly flat but there are some short off shoot trails that have some nice inclines. The short trails along the path offer the most scenic views because they take you to the cool spots along the sides, so if you go definitely don't pass them up! There was also a lot of wildlife but nothing dangerous. There were male buck deer that were about 100 feet a way and females within petting distance. Overall it is an easy trail but still really fun and I would definitely recommend this trail for people of all experience levels and ages! "", ""Short loop but mostly up hill so it'll make you a sweat a bit. Great views of the golf course, beaches & nice expensive houses nearby. Get some ice cream after for a perfect after hike snack"", ""A nice hike for being in civilization. From the entrance it will take you roughly 30 minutes to get to an unpaved trailhead.

I often mountain bike ""rock it"", one of my favorite trails in OC. I have seen a coyote or two on these trails.', 'From the best riders to a beginner rider this is one of the beat and most convenient trails in orange county. Quick and straight to the point! I ride this trail very frequently and absolutely think that it throws a significant amount of difficulty depending on the ride in which you want to do!', 'Well,, the loop sounded interesting enough for me to load up my four legged running partner and make the drive from San Diego to Laguna.  I love finding a new trail to explore.  Two words of caution,,, if you are going to attempt to find this trail,, don\'t google it.  That will take you smack in the middle of a Private Gated residential community.  Although the Security at the gate is very nice and helpful, as he says he has people showing up there all the time looking for the trail head,  save yourself the time.  The actual address of the park is on the 2000 block of Alicia Parkway.  Second mistake for me , was that since this trail had yet to have a review, it did not inform me of the fact that the ""Wilderness"" (and I use that term VERY lossy) Park does not allow dogs anyplace within the park.  wether on or off leash.  So I ended up doing a short run at a park across the street with my dog.  Then I did take some extra time to explore the ""wilderness"" Park.  I would have to say,,, first of all if you are looking for a truly,, or even somewhat of a wilderness park for your trail experience,,, save yourself some wasted time,,, the name of the park is very misleading.  it is not anyones wilderness I must say.  and if you are looking for a ""Trail"" run or hike,,, I would have to say it is more of a nature walk, where you have to pay to park and then you have to walk/run along a paved bike path for a good bit  to get to the dirt trail.  So to sum it up,,, if you are looking for some sort of rugged wilderness single track technical trail running ,, skip this one.  On the other hand if you are looking for a nice stroll with the family and no dog,,, this might be what you are looking for.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '',

Water was also a little too high so tough to get into the cave. Would recommend it for a dry day though! Very quiet tail on January Thursday.', 'The water in the cave is never warm, regardless of the time of year. But very beautiful if you are brave enough to go through. Bring water shoes! This is not a running trail unless you want to bust an ankle.', 'The water in the cave was numbingly cold mid-October but me and my 5 yr old still dared to jump in. It was an easy hike and a nice time down in the cave. Very fun, family friendly hike. Take towels and a floating device if you plan to brave the waters.', 'The river water was a little bit too cold for us in October but we did watch other people swim through the “cave“ to the other side back.Whew! Highly recommended!', 'Awesome surprise at the end.  Swimming in a cave!!', 'This is a good trail for a light to moderate hike. There are some little inclines to get up that are a bit rocky. abouy two miles in to the cave. The cave is awesome. Very cold water but you can float or swim through. The other side is open and we climbed around to the other side.', ""I was a bit worried from some of the mixed reviews but this turned out to be fantastic! Our group included kids from 4 to teens and everyone loved it! It was fun for the younger kids and the teens thought it was awesome. The trail down is medium easy and going back up is the more intense end of easy. The cave great for all ages. Younger kids and adults who aren't as adventuresome can chill in the outer part of the cave in the cold shallow water. The water isn't swift or dangerous at all, at least not in mid-summer. We took the little ones through the cave on floaties and they loved it. It is also possible to swim without a floatie but really cold. And water shoes are highly recommended as it's very rocky. We will definitely be going back!"", 'Not a running trail, it’s an ankle breaker if your not careful.', 'easy trail ...go early enough in the summer to enjoy the water', 'One of my favorite places EVER!', 'There was a toilet by the car park, which I didn’t use so can’t vouch for. It’s a really nice and easy hike down to the first cave, and there are plenty of picnic spots on the way down. When you get down, the first thing you see is the cave, which you can cross into in on the stepping stones over the river. When inside, we left our backpack with our clothes and shoes, put on water shoes and inflated our pool rings. At this point, the water is pretty cold so it’s good to bring something to float into the cave on. My partner hated how icy cold the water was and how the cave was sort of scary at first but actually, once we floated through to the other side, agreed it was awesome and actually really fun. So it’s worth persuading people in your party to go through with it!If we’d planned the logistics ahead of time it might have been good to bring a waterproof bag that could have come with us through the cave, because the other side would have been lovely to chill out on. We floated back through and got really lost as to were the path was supposed to continue, but we muddled our way down the river and found the second cave, which was pretty similar to the first. We got confused about where the path was on the way back, too, so we walked through the river in some parts. Overall, really loved the experience and the river/stream and caves were very magical, but the path itself was hard to follow after the first cave. It was also very quiet when we went, we passed only 4 people (on a Tuesday), and there were only a few instances we found of people’s rubbish so it seems to have improved since other commenters left their reviews!', 'We are not avid hikers, so it was pretty intense on our unconditioned legs! Rocky but fun points on trail, several picnic tables, and swimming through the cave was the highlight for sure! Our family was age 10, 12, 35, 57, and 63. We all enjoyed it. I wouldn’t take children younger than 10 unless they are very aware and willing to listen to your instructions as several drop off’s were pretty scary. Sweat bees or yellow jackets were all over us especially by the water.', ""Great trail.  Took my 5 year old and he loved it as well.  Only 1 or 2 spots where  there was a bit of a drop off that I had to keep a close eye on him.  Also found a tick on him so highly recommend checking your party when you leave.  Caves were awesome though and I can't wait to go back when it's warmer to test the water out."", 'Hidden gem!  Watch out for yellow jackets when you start the trail.', 'I’ve done this hike 4 times I love it, highly recommend swimming through the cave it’s breathtaking literally.', 'The hike down and up is an alright trail. a lot of trash... The first cave, you can go left down or right. regardless what route you take you can actually swim through the cave. I suggest water shoes some water tubes! had no Verizon coverage down there.', 'There is two different caves one right when you get down the trail and the other is about 10-15 walk from that one...second is beautiful', 'Nice day trip with my best friends. Easy hike in. Got a little busy. Definitely will return to swim through the cave.', 'A bit disappointed. Took this trek at the recommendation of a co worker. The walk in and out really nothing to brag about but the cavern at the bottom was interesting and worth seeing this one time. The disappointment came in when I did get to the cavern the general area had trash left behind from past lazy ass visitors who didn’t want to carry their garbage back out so instead left it behind to ruin the experience for others including myself. The worst part was the smell from visitors pissing and shitting wherever they could find a place. Smelly and gross on this day 7-23-18.', ""We thought it was a water trail, so we wore sandals.  It said you could wade across, actually you need a bathing suit to swim it.  if I were to do again, I definitely bring hiking boots, sandals and a bathing suit.  You hike down to river for about 1.5 miles on a rocky trail.  you definitely need close toe shoes.  There is a cavern with stalactites that the river goes through and you can swim through the cavern.  The river is were I'd wear water shoes or sandals.  To get back you need to hike up the trail.  To go down the hill it took about 15 to 20 minutes.  to hike up it took about 40 to 45 minutes."", 'Super easy hike! Brought 4 kids between 9 and 11 and all had a great time! Bring water and a floatie:)', 'beautiful scenery inside the cave... definitely will go again!!', 'This is an amazing adventure!  I had to gather my courage to swim through but so glad I did.  There is another cave down stream that is a bit difficult to walk to but definitely less people.', 'We did this hike, arriving at 8:15am, which was perfect because we were the first people there. By the time we left around 11am the place was PACKED!!! We went to the first cave and went inside to get a taste of the water which was COLD! We didn’t end up swimming to the other side because it was too cold. I definitely recommend floats to use instead of swimming. If you look at my recording, we backtracked trying to go to the next cave (which was the wrong way) but found an AWESOME rope to climb down about 40ft to get to the other side of the cave had we swam through. It was actually a lot of fun climbing down, but had to be done carefully. We got to the other side and explored that side of the cave and also followed the river until we realized we weren’t heading the correct way to the second cave. We backtracked again and finally made it to the second cave which was spectacular. It was more secluded and we were able to wade through to the other side. It was a lot of fun to climb over rocks and sit on ledges inside. The trail getting to the second cave was also more narrow and had more rocks and foliage around. It was super fun but might be harder for someone who isn’t as physically active. To the first cave is easy, to the second cave is moderate to harder end of the “easy” ranking. I highly recommend this!!!', 'enjoyed the hike and the cave. my daughter enjoyed it also... just remember to bring some water shoes.', 'Fun place to spend a hot afternoon.  Take plenty of drinking water or a water purifier.  The hike back to the car is a bit hot and long for some kids.  Just plan to have watermelon and some other goodies at the car for when they get back.', 'Surprisingly not much busy on a 4th of July weekday at 10am. I suggest not to take anything but water, towel, hat, water shoes ( no flippers as you can lose or easily slip) and a must floating device to go through to the other side. You can only swim, definitely cannot wade through the water once you are about 8 feet from the mouth of the cave. My friend and I put all our hiking bags, shoes in a sealed plastic bag thinking we can leave it in the water floating while we wade through. FAILED - we were not strong swimmer and cannot hold on to the bag and swim. We found out that there is another way of getting to the other end of the cave via climbing down steep rock with a rope. This is dwfinitely a must see place.', ""A fantastic hike that's relatively easy (it's downhill to the cave) and a workout on the way back up. The terrain is very rocky but not inaccessible. There is some shade but for the most part you'll be in the sun. Once you get to the cave the are some places to sit and enjoy or get in the water for a quick cool down. Highly recommended: hiking pole, hat, plenty of water, and water shoes. I got there on a Saturday about 9:30 and there were about a dozen people there - hiking back up I probably passed 40+ people (of all ages) and there just isn't a lot of room around or in the cave. Parking is available along the road (the cars can block the entrance sign) or down a paved road. Enjoy!"", ""Really a surprise. The trail is downhill from the road, a rocky path, with nice oaks and ponderous pines. Lots of poison oak along the sides. You can't see nor hear the river until you get right to the end, about 1 mile. then you see the overhang, the river and  the cavern.  It's very dramatic ... Very unique. worth the hike  for sure."", 'Amazing must go/// bring tubes /// water ///---- pack in  pack out /// keep California clean', 'Love this place.  Probably one of my favorite hikes.

Great for families.Is a short hike with lots of rocks so make sure to come properly equipped with hiking shoes or good water shoes. The rocks are very slippery , so be careful.There’s two sides you can hike down.Make sure to make the first left to the first side of the springs. Or else you will be hiking down a rope through s very steep rock. Dangerous by super fun ', 'Take the southern entrance to the trail, near the gate to the access road. The northern entrance of the loop is closed and the trail is unmarked. Once at the bottom you’re greeted with a beautiful pond and a cave you can swim through.', 'Loved it!!! Definitely bring a tube float with you so you can see the other side of the cave!', ""It's an awesome, easy trail and the creek at the end, although pretty cold, is really fun to swim through. You can also swim through the cave to the other side and walk along the creek on that side too. Overall a great trail."", 'makes it so easy to find trails and get active.  I get lost easy and this helps me stay on track.', 'About a mile hike in. Trails are defined and rugged at times but family friendly (5 years and up). The river and falls to Natural Bridges is impressive and a must see. Parking (along hwy) can be a bit tricky starting late morning, but well worth planning to go early in the morning. Swimming area is shaded in areas, shore is rocky and steep in areas. Beautiful location. Watch out for Poison Oak along Trail.', 'Great time today, on Mother’s Day, for a hike. The wife and kid braved the cold water and swam through the cave to the other side. The wife even ran into her cousin! Easy hike down, and fairly easy uphill all the way out. Bring a pair of water shoes and a towel. We will be back!', 'Really fun trail , cave 1 visually beautiful and fun to explore around in , also a neat place to swim.Hike further down to cave 2 some scrambling and climbing required but don’t leave without exploring the second cave, this one was occupied by bats and a couple other critters.On the way to the second cave the stream was flowing with fish and there are some cool spots to sit on the smooth rocks and enjoy the stream. Save some energy to hike back out remember it’s uphill the whole way', ""Writing again as a father of 4. As many have said this place can get busy. We arrived just prior to 9 AM on a Saturday and were the first ones there. The restroom at the trail head is pretty rough but usable. The trail itself is easy in length but there are a couple spots that involve significant drop offs next to the trail. You'll want to keep the little ones close. There is also a ton of poison oak so stay on the trail. The cave is amazing! It's shallow enough for smaller children and those not brave enough to head into the cold dark water. For the bigs and the brave the inner part of the cave is spectacular and the other side of the main cave is less crowded. The river leading out of the cave can be traversed for quite a ways but I HIGHLY recommend water shoes. There were plenty of places to check out fish, crawdads, and tadpoles for the kids. Overall upper natural bridge is a great place to bring the family for some outdoor fun."", 'Absolutely beautiful! The cave is amazing, too cold right now but looking forward to going back in the warm weather.', ""Great hike/climb...we past the first cave over-run with people and followed the trail to a second cave. it was difficult in spots having to climb a bit, but well worth it! there are picnic tables to enjoy your lunch and we encountered the biggest hawk I've ever seen. take care if dipping into this water as there are many crawdads and quiet a bit of trash built up in the cave. Also at the second cave, a huge wasp nest. Overall, great hike!"", 'Fantastic hike to do with family with a spectacular destination of a CAVE!', 'Great hike especially for a late spring or early summer morning.

The cave is pretty cool and easy to explore. Great family hiking area.', 'Went on this trail two days ago. Loved the wow factor at the end which was the cave.

It took us about 55 minutes to the Cave. May take some quicker but for my 5 year old first hike. I believe we did well. I would suggest take water shoes as suggested poor to my review. I took a small ice chest nothing to heavy to carry, We loved it. The water was a bit cold. We swam thru the cave to the other side. in the middle of it, you can not touch the ground.

The second cave going down the stream is gorgeous!', 'Best destination hike but you need to go super early or you will find a million kids and families in the first cave - the second cave is hard to get to but amazing - we had it all to ourselves when we went because there is no longer a trail to get to it - you must off trail and follow the water - rock jumping is a must to find your way - bring a float device with you - the water is too cold to just swim.....', 'Nice short trail is really worth the walk.  Tables along the route so plan a pick nick.  I was hear on a Saturday afternoon and it was not crowded.', ""This was even more amazing than I had expected! This is a such a unique place to visit and experience, anyone can do this hike. It's harder on the way out because it's more uphill but otherwise this cave was just beyond amazing. We didn't even bother going to the next, it was beautiful, BUT definitely bring a floaty to float through. The water gets deep and is really cold since it's in the shade."", 'Very easy and short hike to the cave. So easy even a 2 year old can do it. Make sure to bring water shoes and floater to enjoy swimming in the cave. Dogs not allowed. Picnic tables available in the trail and at the cave/natural bridge area.', 'Getting to the first cave was an easy hike, a refreshing swim awaits you when get there.  The second cave is another 30 minutes in to the left of the first cave.  This hike is a bit harder but is quite rewarding once you get there....', ""This is a hidden gem that we enjoyed a lot!  The hike is rated easy, probably because it's short, only .7 miles each direction.  Going in it is all down hill, and the trail gets pretty rocky in sections, and ends with some stairs of various sizes.  The float through the cave was wonderful!  There is just enough light inside to see the amazing rock formations.  The water looks black once you are inside, and we were too chicken to have swam where we can't see.  It is also very deep in some areas, in the middle of the cave.  We hiked up stream a little ways, it really is a beautiful place!  Amazing that something so unique and beautiful is still free, and in good condition.  Very little human trash.\nSome things to note:\nBring lots of water, there is none.\nMake use of the vaulted toilets at the top, there are no restrooms anywhere else.\nBring a floaty. The water is very cold, even in July.  We brought cheap inner tubes that we could blow up at the bottom, then deflate before we hiked out. \nBring water shoes, the stream bed & cave has some sharp rocks, and shoes make it nice to maneuver around.\nSign at the top says NO pets.\nPlease clean up after yourself & leave no trace. We picked up a bit of trash we found, to keep this area beautiful."", 'Terrific day hike! Not to hard and the reward at the bottom is a nice cool dip! Love to see it with more water. Good place for the family, young children if they are hikers will do fine. Bring a float to go through the cave. You can swim through but can see more on a float.', 'Great swimming place; how often can you swim through a cave?!!!  Short hike down the trail.  Watch out for poison oak!   Not dried up that much considering the California drought.  Definitely bring a float device or noodle if you want to swim through the cave.  It also  makes it easy to explore the travertine  formations within while you are swimming or to just hang out inside the cave for a while.  There is a rock about halfway through the cave on the right side some people were  jumping off of. The water is a  little chilly at first but you get used to it  pretty quickly  and after the hot hike down it  feels wonderful.  A very interesting fact; years ago  in the 1880s it was a  popular picnic resort.  The stream was diverted to one side of cave so that  up to 100 people could go inside while dried out and have picnics-  natural air conditioning before air-conditioners were invented!  If you explore downstream a bit,  you will find pools of little crawdads or some type of crabs  swimming around in the water.', 'Short, easy hike. Worth it for the natural tunnels the stream has made through the rock at the end. Great place to cool off in the summer. The hike is nothing particularly special but the destination is great. Went on a weekday and had it to ourselves.', ""This short hike is definitely more about the destination than the journey, down to the most unique swimming hole I've ever encountered.  It's a popular place, though not many were daring the numbingly cold water in the middle of the cave.  It was worth the chill and kept me from overheating on the walk back up."", ""If you like the cave at the end of the trail, take an extra 15 minutes and hike downstream to another similar cave! It's a bit longer and just as awesome! The trail is not quite as well defined, but just keep going down stream and you will find it!"", ""So worth the hike to get the cave at the end. The water was perfect temperature and only a few people there on a Friday. Got tired towards the end though but I did have my 4 month old on my chest. It's a fairly easy hike ☺️"", 'Went here last year with my boyfriend and his family! It was an easy ""hike,"" more like a walk. There was 2 amazing caves on the opposite ends of each other, it just requires more exploring. Also, the water is super cold to swim in, so I\'d bring a floaty next time!', ""My wife and I just got done a few hour's ago. We enjoyed the hike, we are new to hiking just started a few weeks ago this is our 3rd trail in as many weeks. Our leg's were a little tight going up hill.But the overall experience was a great one. Next time will bring water shoe's and a intertube. So we can float inside the cave."", 'At the end of the trail you arrive to a cool cave with water where you can swim. The hike is easy (we are not fit) and one of us was carrying a 6 months old baby.The views are not the best, but I think is good if you are nearby.', ""This is a famous local trail that can also be quite the party spot for youngsters with enough grit to lug an ice chest down to the water and back out again. On Parrotts Ferry Road you will see a brown landmark sign barely a half mile north of the bridge. There is a dirt entrance that doesn't look like much but plenty of parking once you turn in. A lot of people drive by without noticing the sign or seeing the cars parked which are out of sight from the road. Once there, the trail is quite groomed  and east to traverse. Wear your swim gear! The river actually runs through an awesome cave. As a matter of fact Moaning Caverns is only about 2 miles away. It can get a little crowded on the weekends, especially in the summer. So try to check it out during the week."", 'Short downhill to destination, take a float tube to explore the cave.', 'Great hike for little kids, not to long and they LOVE swimming the caves.  Water is cold but worth it.', 'Great easy hike, swim through the cold water. Picnic tables next to the river. Follow the river down about a quarter mile and you will find the second cave you can walk all the through it.', 'Good, short hike and fun place to explore. Bring water shoes! Fun to float/swim through. I prefer going on weekdays during summer when less families and children there.', 'Fantastic hike!  Beautiful views and a very cool cave.  To get through requires getting very wet, so be prepared to swim.', 'I loved this hike.  I will say though is you are out of shape, it will not seem ""easy"" at all.  I\'m out of shape but thanks to Shaun T have lost 18lbs in the past 8 weeks.  If I had not dropped that weight, I\'m not sure how long it would have taken me to hike up. lol  We completed the hike round trip in about 45 mins (less the time we were sightseeing).   But it was a wonderful experience and worth it when you can see the cave.  We were lucky to have missed the hikers going up and down while we enjoyed the views but I can see how busy it will be during the summer.', 'This was a fantastic hike,not to hard not to long.The caverns(bridges) were amazing.There were about 30 people there when we left.Go early.', 'First time there, it was quite hot today. Only one other car and even then I didn\'t see anyone. The one mile down and back using the end if the road trail can be very dangerous and hard coming back up, FYI. I wish I brought my tevas so I could walk through the whole cavern/bridge in the water. I feel the ""back"" end is more majestic but the front end was beautiful too. I recommend seeing both ends. Just know that the back end requires steeper slopes to get down and up unless you walk through the middle. I, too, had a pesky squirrel eyeing my trail pack. Being under the bridge was nice and cool, but coming back up the trail was so hot, that it almost erased my ""cool"" experience so I headed to angels camp for a cool drink. I stopped at moaning caverns along the way but didn\'t have time to do the tour or many other activities they had there. This is well worth the hike and made my day. I will come here again. It was troubling to see a few broken beer bottles and other plastic bottles. So you can see its a drinking spot. I think because of the rim fire  going on near Yosemite there weren\'t that many people on the road. At the end of my hike I did run into a woman with her dog coming down the trail. I will also bring more food with me next time so I can do a proper picnic. The front side has 3 or 4 picnic tables.', 'One of the most amazing hikes I have done! Short hike down a steep hill but worth every step! The water was cold and refreshing and the views were beyond amazing!', ""After a short single track you come to a fork in the trail, go right. It's hot and dry this time of year (Aug 13) so it was a very pleasant surprise to find a lot of cool water in the cave. Enough to jump off rocks and not touch the bottom. For first-timers if you get nervous or tired swimming through the cave, to the sides of the cave there are footholds you can grab onto for a breather/regroup. Kids love this. We had a grandma with us and she was able to do this with a borrowed floatie. Floaties are a great idea so that you can lie on your back and look up at the top of the cave. Bring a waterproof cam or a waterproof sleeve for your iphone. You will get amazing pics and have an amazing time!!"", ""Different paths to get to the cave. Brought both my boxers. Sign at the easier trail says no pets allowed, but as long as you're a responsible pet owner you'll be ok. Water and weather today was amazing. "", 'My 5 star rating is not for the actual hike itself which is quite short and easy, but for the amazing cave at the end of the trail this is the best swimming spot my family has ever enjoyed. The coyote creek is the perfect place to cool off during the hot summer. The trail is so easy to find right on Parrots Ferry road, turn into the parking area when you se the sign for Natural Bridges. The. River runs through the cave which is about 100 feet long. There are plenty of shallow areas to stand, sit or play. It is deep (well over our heads) in the middle of the cave. The mouths of each cave end are great places to hang out. The formations are incredible to look at. Simply beautiful . Hihgly recommend for families with children who are able to dothe 2 miles roundtrip. Word of caution: watch for rattle snakes. We had an adventurous encounter with a rattle snake. Also make sure any snacks you leave along side the cave mouth while you are swimming are sealed up tightly. The squirrels are quite practiced at thievery.', ""This a great hike for both families and the adventurous! There are 2 ways to complete the trail; one is a loop that starts at the end of Airola Rd. This one is more challenging of a hike and gets a little steep towards the end, I don't recommend taking kids this way. At the start of Airola Rd. right when you turn off the highway there is an easier trail that gently slopes down to the caves. Both trails lead to the same cave but there is actually another cave if you follow the creek downstream. There is a nice trail and a couple spots to dip in the water. Bring lunch because there is a lot of great picnic spots!"", ""Awesome trail for a spur of the moment lunch hike! Short and easy hike! Wear water shoes and swim suit if you plan on taking a dip, you can swim under the bridge to the other side too. Make sure to go on a weekday when there's less families and its quieter!"", ""Not much of a hike.  It's a very short trail, but it is still worth going.  It's a good beginner hike to take small children and the cave at the end of the trail was beautiful."", 'Nice little hike. Family friendly. WATCH OUT FOR POISON OAK/ Sumac.', 'a great hike to a beautiful location.  the hike back was a little more difficult but my 2, 9 year old boys and wife were no worse for the wear. swam the cave a bit but it got very deep.  panned earth from the bottom of the cave and pulled out a few lil treasures. location-wise one of my favorite.', 'this place is SO beautiful... i love it so much. i took my grandpa here and he loved it. it has some good sized fish in that cave too. great hike', 'March 9, 2013. / 11:30am-3:30pm / Sunny 64F (Felt like 70F)\n\nThis was definitely an adventure! My friends and I actually missed the, ""main entrance"" to the trail which is just after the turn off point to pull in and park your cars. If you drive to the end, you\'ll have to turn around, but there is a gate opening with a trail which is where we thought the start of it was. I\'ll just say, ""the best path is the hardest earned.""\n\nIf you choose the end of the road opening, it begins with a nice smooth trail, dirt walk/hike, and some scenic views then it becomes very jagged rock area, steep hills, drop off points, and some muddy run off areas. We actually found the opposite end of the Natural Bridges cave which my friends and I believe was well worth it, and much more impressive than the actual trail\'s cave. The trails were empty on our route and we could see some other hikers down below by the river who had accessed the area via the main trail or perhaps one of many covered, lesser traveled trails. A couple people were gold panning, some swimming through the cave, and a couple walking with their dog. DO NOT bring your animals or heavy equipment if you choose the end of the road trail. It is more of a moderate hike and while I did bring my DSLR regretting that I forgot my tripod, later during the hike I was happy that I had forgotten it due to the steep sloping of rocks and hills along the narrow trails. Amazing photo opportunities, but definitely not worth falling down for.\n\nThe cave itself on the intake of the Coyote River was utterly amazing. Don\'t be discouraged if you can\'t immediately find a trail leading down; I was tempted to slide down a steep sloped rock rainwater runoff before my friend\'s advised against it and I scoped out a higher trail that eventually lead down. You can get some great views and see faint light from where the outtake (main trail cave mouth) is shining through and the smooth limestone walls were a sight to see. A small hole shooting water out on the inner left went almost unnoticed until my friend pointed it out. The water is deep here, so tread carefully if you plan on walking through. Truly the gem of the adventurous hike there.\n\nThe main trail\'s attraction, the Natural Bridge, was beautifully laid with limestone and smoothed pebble stones beneath shallow waters accentuated the setting. We hit the time of day just right as the water was gleaming into the cave providing adequate lighting. A miniature waterfall from inside the cave provided peaceful sound among lots of water droplets all around. Be careful if your camera isn\'t waterproof! This area is shallow enough to wade through calf deep (I\'m 6\'5"") though I didn\'t have the shoes nor wanted to take the chance falling with my equipment. There are some nice spots to sit as well as a table or two for a packed lunch which I advise as the trail should be explored thoroughly to take everything in.\n\nI will revisit this sometime in the future. Please check out the pictures as I have uploaded quite a few and make an attempt to take an off-beaten path to explore the other end of the cave!\n\nCheers and happy trails!', 'Beautiful place to be. The water was cold but  it was well worth it.', ""We went hiking on a fairly warm day in Mid August. The hike was short and really well shaded. It was a fairly easy hike and has multiple splitting trails that lead to picnic areas. It can get confusing at some points but no big deal. We ventured to Lower Natural Bridge and really enjoyed the sound of the stream and a good lunch. We felt like continuing our hiking journey and continued downstream. Not a good idea. Lol It got really sketchy and dangerous. I wore shorts and my legs and shoes came out covered in some type small spikey weed seeds. Had splinters all over my fingers from removing those tacky seeds that stuck all over my shoes, socks and shorts.  So stopping at Lower Natural Bridge would have been a smarter choice. Fun hike but we drove from the East Bay (approx. 1hr 45min each way) and didn't feel the juice was worth the squeeze. Enjoyable but not worth the drive. "", 'I really enjoyed the scenic hike and the nartural bridge. The hike was easy, but I wish it was longer. I did notice a trail going beyone the natural bridge, but I was not sure where it led to. The natural bridge was very unique. The water was freezing, but I could bare it. Definitely worth swimming in! I would like to check out moaning caverns next time since it is just down the road. I really like caves and would like to see more if anyone has a place they would like to recommed, please let me know! ', 'Very cool trail and the cave was awesome!!!! My 3 year old son did great and our 2 dogs loved it. Be sure to bring your swim suits and WATER SHOES!!! Also bug/mosquito spray. ', ""An fairly easy hike that has an amazing reward. Seeing those caves were unlike anything I've ever seen. So cool. "", ""Great hike. If you follow the water downstream you will find the lower natural bridge. It's well worth the time to hike down to the lower cave. Very cool. "", 'Fairly easy trail.  Caves are interesting but not spectacular.', ""It was alright. Bring a swimsuit for inside the cave which is pretty cool. The hike itself was dry and hot but not too difficult. Would've picked something else, but it was worth the bit of exercise."", ""Upper Natural Bridge of Calaveras County is a great place to go and cool off for the day. The trail is well traveled and downhill. Going home was challenging because it's all uphill and after swimming all day my dog was even a little worn out.  Beautiful cavern that you can easily swim through to the other side.Careful to stay on the trail because poison oak is all around this area. Other than that, it makes for a great fun day."", 'This was a fun hike.  What made it so great was family time.  It was an easy hike going in, but you had to watch pretty closely as there were lots of tripping hazards.  The creek was running well and it was beautiful.  The cave was awesome, activities included catching frogs and crayfish, splashing, a picnic lunch.  After all that we did some exploring down stream from the cave and found some wonderful swimming holes when the weather warms up a bit more.  \nOn the hike back instead of going back the way you came, at the sign that tells you about the Natural Bridge, keep going, you can use this trail to explore the mouth of the cave.  If to keep taking the trail to the right it goes up and up and up.  While this is much more strenuous than the hike it, it creates a natural loop back to the abandoned road that you parked on on the way in.\nBe sure to check for ticks when you get back, our family of five + dog ended up with 7 ticks.', 'My husband and I went last weekend after he worked in the morning.  It was a good little hike.  We most enjoyed exploring in the cave once we got down there.  But in order to go further you would need a swimming suite.  We accidently went down the old trail.  Park up by the sign and the new trail head is before you hit the bathrooms.', 'This is an easy 3/4 mile hike one way into the canyon to a year-found stream which cuts through the surrounding limestone creating a cave and a ""natural bridge"".  The inside of the cave with water running from the ceiling creating waterfalls is amazing.  I hadn\'t been here in years, but it was my husbands first time and worth the short hike.  I recommend going early as it gets crowded on a summer day.

Make sure you search for the actual road name and not the falls name themselves for mapping navigation in Google. My bad!When you\'re at the correct road, it\'s obvious since there\'s a sign thanking you for your adventure pass (yes you need one).This hike is short and up a private paved road (which you must park at the base). I knew from other reviews that the road was paved, so this didn\'t ruin the hike for me. The views and rocky cliff sides, and the birds and squirrels everywhere still made this a nice short hike.We went on a Tuesday at 10 am and just barely beat a light amount of foot traffic.At the top of the road, there is a great viewpoint of the falls, and the dirt trail begins. The ""steep"" part mentioned in other reviews is probably 6-10 feet and really no big deal since you\'re walking sideways with the wall and there\'s plenty of traction. Once you pass this and round the corner, you\'re at the base of the falls.And magnificent falls they are. Totally worth this short trek to go see.', 'This trail is mostly paved road.Not my type of hike I like to do but we made the best of it by creating our own trail through the Mt. and Creek in the end we made it a very intense hike loved the waterfall', ""Very easy hike, you can't even tell you walked a mile but great scenery.

It was a relatively easy and short hike. I made it 3.71 miles taking Falls Rd to the falls, then doubling back from there and heading up Baldy Road for a little while. I turned down the service road/trail that lead to the top level of the Ski Lift parking lot. That was a very steep down hill and the bottom of it was our start point for hiking Baldy the next day in honor of our disabled veterans ""Climb for Heroes Fundraiser"". From there I had to walk down all five parking levels and down the road to get back to my car. Again it was an easy day. Great views and the falls were flowing very well. There were two individuals repelling from the falls just I as arrive.', 'Great hike, with great views. We started at the Falls Rd trailhead and took the fire road up to Baldy Notch, from there we headed North West towards the Devils Backbone. Snow covered portions of the trail and crampons were used by some to get to the peak. Views were awesome from the backbone as well as from the peak which was completely snow covered. From the peak we proceeded to the South towards the Baldy bowl passed the ski hut (which has a little outhouse in the back), and followed the trail the rest of the way down to the fire road we started on. The trail down was pretty slick and crampons were used off and on. This is NOT an ""easy"" hike, there is over 4,000ft in elevation gain and a total of about 10.4 miles. The elevation plays a factor as well. You could call it easy if you take the lift up to the notch and hike a total of 3.2 miles to the peak, but thats cheating. Its not the most difficult hike and the trail is well maintained, I can see why this is used as a training hike for Whitney. BTW check out Socalhiker.net for info on this and other great hikes in socal.', ""Easy hike, not too dangerous even during winter (caution and balance are still required). Been here several times and there's always plenty of water running downstream. Best part is touching the fresh water as it falls."", ""This waterfall is an unfortunate victim of the same thing as many local spots of this type. Graffiti on the boulders. It hurts my heart when I see it, because years ago this was not a problem in wild spaces. The hike is mostly easy, on the road. There is one sketchy spot that is on the side of a hill it curves around, and if you're not sure footed it could be tricky. I have a bad back and a bad knee, but I managed it. You want to wear hiking boots for safety, and trekking poles might help if you are uncertain.No waterfall in this region is going to be too impressive in the middle of a drought in the middle of summer, but there was water flowing when I was there recently. It's nice as far as a spot to listen to the water falling, and take a few pictures… but as I said there is graffiti. The hike is not excessively difficult. Use bug repellent, or have a headnet, or possibly both. FLIES omg. The reviews I have read complaining about flies at Manker Flats Campground across the road are no joke. The flies are irritating as heck. It's worth seeing if you've never been there but I can't say that I would take the time to go again now that I have."", ""This was an easy hike to do. It was a short distance to reach the waterfall which was beautiful and full of flowing water. There was even snow still left on the side of the hill. We continued back up the trail and took it around and down to the ski lift parking area. I'm not sure of the total distance, but it was worth going back to do again. The scenery was breathtaking and we even came across some baby chipmunks."", 'This trail definitely gives you a great work out.

The gate that you have to pass to go up the paved path is on a side road on your left hand side just past the the Manker Flats camp ground which will be on your right hand side off Mt. Baldy Rd.  This was an easy hike as half of it was up a paved road.  The rock/dirt trail that leads from the paved road to the falls could be a little rough if you're clumsy like me because of some of the rocks.  I also made the mistake of thinking that I had to climb lower to get to the falls, so I climbed down some rocks that were on my left side when I went off the paved road.  Turns out there's nothing but wood and bushes down there.  So I climbed back up and continued on the dirt around a corner of the mountain and found the dirt/rock trail to the falls.  Once I got to the falls I was in complete awe!  Since I came on a day where there was a little drizzle and overcast, I had the whole place to myself the whole time I was there, which was about 45 minutes.  I played in the water, took lots of pictures, and just marveled at all the beauty.  This may be a short hike, but well worth it."", 'Great trail for beginners to get a good glimpe of the San Antonio falls.  There were lots of other pleasant hikers on the weekend.

Accidentally went off the trail several times and ended up spending almost 4 hours on it, but the views were amazing. No water or toilets on the trail so be prepared. Reeally steep slopes at the beginning but it gets easier later. Appropriate footwear is highly recommended, especially if it has rained recently. Overall, an amazing workout for the day... More than I had expected.', 'Nice place to smoke a joint. Also there is a sweet swing about halfway up in the grove of trees on the left', 'One tough hike - even though rained a ton yesterday not too much mud. Going up is tough but not many people - when get to the top use AllTrails bc there is a ton of other unmarked trails. Coming down tough on knees and a lot more people', ""Great hike with great views. The first part is very steep. There aren't any bathrooms along the trail. Well trafficed and maintained."", 'so steep!!', 'Went on this trail this morning with my two dogs. The steep parts were killer, but doable. Got a great workout in. Half of the hike I only saw 1 person, but the beginning and end I saw tons of people, so if you’re looking to have quiet time, come early. I started at 8:45am on Saturday.', ""Really great hike except for the section after you reach Grizzly peak boulevard. It's hard to find the next section of the trail (you need to turn left at the end of the trail and walk along Grizzly peak to find the trail entrance) and then the next section is not well maintained. Also the trail is not well marked  so have a map handy. If it wasn't for that segment, I'd rate this hike a 4/5. Great views.We did the full trail and it's definitely a solid workout (some of the steeper climbs I've done). It looks us about 2.5hrs with some water breaks. Some shaded and some direct sun. Recommend plenty of water, bug spray, and suncreen. We also brought our pup who loved the climb as well and was off leash the majority of the time. Also definitely recommend solid trail shoes or hiking boots.We arrived around 9am and had no issues with parking right at the trail head."", 'Steep and at an incline most of the way so wear shoes with good grips as it is slippery downhill. Offers great views of bay.', 'Be prepared. Just be prepared. It’s steep but rewarding!', 'It’s really steep, which makes the return trip (descent) a bit difficult. The majority of it is in the sun, with limited tree coverage, so be sure to wear sunscreen! I prefer some of the other fire trail hikes that are more wooded.', 'This hike is a nice representation of California.  Know that this trail is legit hard. The uphills are steep and seemingly never ending. The views will provide just the right amount of distraction and reason to stop and rest.  There’s also plenty of shady parts. It’s a bit tricky to follow the trail on the rebound. We got off trail, but plenty of cut overs were available. The trail also had quite a few benches, so take a lunch/snacks and enjoy the view!  There’s a reason this is called a panoramic hike. You’ll have multiple views of Mt Tam, SF, Oakland and beyond. Take plenty of water!', 'I love this hike and have been back 4 times in the past 2 months. It’s about a 6.5 mile loop and the first half is all incline but you get some breaks in between each hill which helps. Be prepared for some rocky/gravel areas which can get slippery so wear good hiking shoes. The second half of the hike is easy and you get even better views from the other side of the hill. Beautiful views throughout the trail. About half is covered. It can get pretty hot depending on the weather and the annoying flies come out.', 'TSEST', 'bring your hiking shoes! very steep uphill/downhill. overall great trail, and beautiful views', 'Tough steep hills but overall great workout. Enjoyed the views but it was overcast so the clouds and fog covered the view of the city. Cool to be above the fog, though.', 'Amazing views. Yes the uphill is very steep and a bit of a challenge but so so worth it!! Definitely will be back', 'Great hike. Pretty steep in stretches, but the views are worth it! We went counter clockwise which seemed to be less intense.', 'One of my top favorite Bay Area hikes!', 'Great views and steep but there is no signage along the trails. Near Grizzly Peak the trail was covered with poison oak and overgrown so we turned around instead.', 'Overall nice trail for the good view and convenient/easy access. Definitely very good workout on the incline. Certain parts of the trail are too steep and slippery with loose dirt and rocks, so it may get unsafe if not wearing the right shoes. There were no signage along the trails and many many splits, making it a bit difficult to navigate without frequently checking the GPS on my phone.', 'Great, convenient hike! You get a solid workout from the steep climb, and the views are pretty nice.', 'Awesome hike, started counter clockwise, straight up first 1.3 Miles, then continued climb up to 2.7 Miles.  It’s hard as described, if one starts clockwise then it’s less intense. Spectacular view of Oakland, San Francisco, Emeryville, Berkley, Richmond, Lafayette, and Moraga. Lot of wildflowers.  6.7 miles with elevation gain 1,667 feet.', 'As described, hard but rewarded with awesome views of Bay Area.  Never imaged a trail like this will be nested in along those big mansions.  The first 3 miles are hard, coming down is challenging too, hiking shoes are a must.  Overall it challenged me, and will do it gain on my next biz trip.', 'Great views and only 3 hard elevations', 'Do it!  You will not be disappointed.  Views are really great', 'one of my favs. great intense inclines and areas if flat and down hill parts. fantastic views and always a great hike in this area and on this trail !', 'Very scenic trail and a great workout. Went there by myself but if anyone needs company would love to go back :)', 'Awesome hike! challenging the whole time with amazing views to reward. definitely will be going back', ""Very scenic. Saw a sign about mountain lion but didn't see any. What a disappointment!"", 'Hard. About a good 800ft elevation gain within the first .7 miles. Gorgeous view of the Bay Area. Wear trekking boots as the path is steep and slippery.', 'This hike was a great sequence of microclimates and excellent views of the East Bay. I will definitely be adding it to my list of regular hikes. The exposed section near Dwight tests your footing, so watch out there.', 'Great local hike! Th first mile is basically straight up (60ish floors on my health app). Then rolling hills. Great views of the bay. Especially beautiful in spring with loads of wildflowers.', ""I'm 42 and in decent shape but not a fitness fanatic. I thought the first 2 miles of the trail were a challenge and had to walk pretty slowly.  But after that it is mostly down hill.  About 30% shade on the way uphill that was certainly welcome on a hot day!"", 'There are some STEEP sections!  Beautiful views, terrific work out.', ""It's a tough climb up, but well worth it with the spectacular views.  It's not well marked, so I kept looking at the map on the app to follow the track.  The trail isn't as shaded as I thought it would be based on the satellite view.  I would say it's about 50% shaded, but that might be generous."", 'Beautiful and challenging trail! Enjoyed it very much. The only thing is that the portion by and along the road is overgrown by dry brush. Be sure you and your furry friends do a thorough tick check!', ""It's a steep one! First part is really tough but 2nd half is more shaded. Not a very well marked trail. Amazing views along the way!"", ""This trail should be rated hard, not moderate. The uphill portion at the start is much harder and steeper than any moderate trail I've done, and I hike a lot. You need to be in good shape to hike this incline. Part of the trail goes along a road, so watch out for cars. The trail also has lots of tall grass, so watch out for ticks too. The views are incredible, truly panoramic. We encountered a violent meth-head on the trail who tried to start a fight with us (we ran away). The trailhead also has signs about car break-ins. It's not the safest trail I've done. Women would be wise not to hike this trail alone."", 'Always an awesome hike.', ""Beautiful views all the way through, great uphill climbs. The route also tempers the downhill climb so it's not rocky and slipper"", 'Hiked to the peak with my dog. It was steep on the way, but yes, it was sooo worth it. There are a lot of flowers up the top this season. My dog loved it too', 'Nice loop where you can get the tough hiking out of the way in the first half. Decent shade and great views.', 'Can be a bit challenging for some on the way up but the views will be well worth it.', ""This is on the verge of being hard. If starting from the bottom be ready for a tushy workout. Muddy if a recent storm has hit. The whole loop isn't easy to follow. Most people turn around."", 'Very muddy trail in several sections this time!  Shoes stuck in mud -- there is no escape. A few fallen trees on trail too, but can be easily navigated. Lots of dogs that should be on leash. But overall a great experience: a golden sunset, the air filled with sweet plant smell, and some REALLY loud frogs after dark.', ""Unbelievable views. I would say this is Hard though, as it's quite steep. But great hike with views."", 'great view!!!', 'We only hiked up the Panoramic Hill (probably less than 2 miles up and down). Beautiful scenery of the Bay. Moderate traffic with lots of dogs and families. Good for children too if they are up for the uphill challenge, especially the last climb up the Panoramic Hill. The view was rewarding!!', 'The total hike was 7.5 miles. Sometimes covered with tree, sometimes not.Though we climbed more than 1000 feet, but as it was not a continuous uphill path, we didn’t face too much difficulties. It was great for exercise. The trail was not at all crowded. Very few people were hiking with us. Even sometimes we three were alone on the path.

The guide provided on this page is the best you'll find and was sufficient for when I hiked it with my friends.\n\nWe arrived around 10am on a Sunday, parked in a nearby residential area and headed up the fire trail.\n\nThe first part of the hike involved a relatively steep climb with little shade. It was tiring, warm and very enjoyable. As you climb, there are multiple points of interest with really great views. I recommend you pause and take a moment to appreciate how the view changes as the elevation keeps changing. There are great views of Berkley, Oakland, San Francisco, Bay Bridge, Alcatraz, Golden Gate Bridge, as well as both treasure and angel island. We observed as San Francisco was covered entirely in Fog early in the morning, but cleared up by midday. The view of the cliffside houses was a great addition and made for good discussion as a dream to shoot for one day.\n\nWhen we reached POI #7 (Grizzly Peak), we made the left turn a tad too early and walked through the spiky bushes, along loose gravel, continuously questioning whether or not we made the right turn. It wasnâ\x80\x99t a very pleasant experience, and was followed by a histerical laugh when we exited back onto the trail and realized that a clear pathway was only fifteen feet away.\n\nThe whole hike took about 3 hours, which accounts for several breaks, and a couple incorrect turns that had us turn back. The health app on my phone registered a walked distance of 7.5 miles and 136 floors climbed. We ran into several groups along the way, but it was still desolate enough enough that it felt like we were immersed in nature away from the city."", 'Parked on Tangewood Road and started up the stairs and it was a long uphill climb from there which is exactly what i was looking for for the type of training i am doing. Its a consistent climb and burn for the first two miles and then flattens out for a quick quarter mile run with great views of the campus and the east bay then you encounter another smaller hill which leads you to the steepest and last hill which is great for those looking for hill work. Its less than a quarter mile but steep and footing is tough. Good trail shoes needed for that last hill and when you done with that leads you to a good 3.5 mile mostly flat and smooth run back to the start. Great spot for hills and a run. Now one of my favorite spot for cardio.', 'This should NOT be rated ""moderate"" hike. From elevation hikes right from the get go, this should be rated difficult for those of us with moderate joint problems. The trip back down was more difficult than the arduous trip up. While we liked the challenge, we could not get beyond the first few miles of the trail\'s quick elevation gain. Please revise the difficulty of this trail!', 'Great hike!  But be aware, 1500+ feet of elevation gain.  Very detailed trip notes, so glad I had them with me!  However, could have used a little more detail with the very end of the hike.', 'Great views, but no signage throughout the hike, making it hard to know which path to choose in order to follow this loop.

For fitness context, I am a mid twenty year old who goes to the gym 2-3 days a week and is active during my job and my boyfriend is in his early 30's and goes to the gym 4 days a week. We found this trail really great and got a nice workout in without feeling spent or crazy sore by the end. As people have mentioned, the bouldering is the main challenging part of this hike, but it's pretty short and surprisingly easy. For example, several dogs were able to do it. It took us from around 1:00-5:00 for the whole hike, but we stopped and explored the area around Cleo's Bath a bit. Also, the trail isn't incredibly well marked once you leave the pinecrest lake loop, so watch for the blue areas and stay with your group! We picked up a lost hiker on the way back to the lake so it definitely can happen. there was no place to get portable water along the trail but there was a flowing river so bring water or a filter.

There was plenty of shade to enjoy on a hot day. Although I did see dogs at the bath I wouldn’t recommend bringing them up there.

Keep an eye out for blue spray painted arrows, piled rocks, and occasionally arrows that look like they were done with crayon! If all else fails, follow the water up!

A little challenging at times especially on the last pitch. Definitely worth it though.', ""Pretty! The loop around the lake goes by cabins and is well-trafficked and flat. The hike up to Cleo's bath is fairly flat and easy terrain (though sometimes hard to find). It truly is the last 1/4 where it gets hard—turns almost into bouldering instead of hiking. I started the hike around 7:45am and saw almost no one on my way up, but many on my way back down. Cleo's bath is freezing and still quite rough, but still beautiful and fun to put a toe in.

Some are very faded and hard to find.', ""Very tedious hike, not recommended for beginners. You begin on the side of the lake the trail takes you to the corner of the lake and starts leading you into the mountain. The first half was very pleasant. Although after you reach the end it eases you into climbing over rocks and boulders. It was very doable not too insane. This goes on about 2.5 miles of on and off rock climbing and a steady trail. The last end of the trail shoots you straight up the mountain and you're literally maneuvering through large rocks. After you get through that you finally reach the destination of Cleo's pools it was an amazing view over looking the lake and trees that you fought through to get there. I was very unprepared for this trip, expected 6.5 miles round trip ended up reaching 9.2 miles, that's staying on the trail and not wandering off into the abyss. But it was definitely well worth it. Would absolutely return, just next time I would be more prepared."", ""Great hike, just completed it last Saturday. It was close to 90F mid-day.

Bring bug spray, and lots of water! I drank 6 water bottles. Way longer than expected! It might have been 3 miles from the trail head, but the hike yo the trail head was at least 3 miles too. So realistically I would plan on 12-15 miles round trip."", ""One of our favorite hikes! Absolutely beautiful, challenging, and rewarding! Can't wait to go back!"", 'Loved it! It was a difficult climb toward the end to reach the top, but worth it.', ""Great fun hike! I'd say the hike difficulty is around 7.5. The last .5 miles is definitely strenuous. You'll need to climb over massive granite slabs and boulders to get to the top. We did a full loop around Pinecrest lake so our trip was a bit longer than the typical 6.5 miles out and back hike.\nIf you plan to go there this season, better do it soon while water is still streaming from the falls and you can swim anywhere you like (except near the dam) I heard it can get pretty dry mid-summer. We hiked last Saturday so the trail was heavily trafficked out especially around Pinecrest Lake and parking can be a pain if you're coming late in the morning. You really need to start your hike early."", 'hiked this trail a few days ago it was a challenge and was totally worth the hike! a must see for sure!', ""I enjoyed the falls up river more than Cleo's Bath.

The large pool is still filled but there is no running water from higher elevation. The journey alone was nice but starting from the southern parking lots and getting to the trail head really is like walking through everyone's backyard. I went half into the bath and the water was nice as is the lake water which you might as well take a swim while there. Took us about 6 hours round trip with probably 5 hours of movement. The blue arrow are hardly visible right now but someone was nice enough to make rock stacks next to some of them so that helped zero my eyes in. Might be worth a decent trek to come back during the winter snow."", ""Hiked from the Pinecrest Lake campgrounds to Cleo's Bath around the south(?) side of the lake and then finished looping the lake on the way back for about 7 miles roundtrip. Weather in July 2015 was overcast and cool (thunderstormy). The final push to the top was strenuous and I like to consider myself pretty in-shape. Water was clean but the level was low and I didn't take a swim due to the likelihood of lightning. Just downstream and to the right of the baths there are some climbing anchor chains - looks like people do some canyoneering or rappelling into the canyon; brr!\nStill, great hike."", 'Great hike, as others have said keep your eyes out for the blue arrows, and be prepared to use your hands to get up the last stretch, but completely worth it. Already planning on going back next spring', ""Fantastic destination hike from Pinecrest Lake to Cleo's bath. \nMy tips:\nStart the hike as early as possible. You want to spend as much of your day relaxing by Cloes bath :)\nAfter the Cleo's bath trailhead, the trail is poorly marked except for large blue arrows spray painted on the rocks.\nBring more water than you anticipate needing. I went through my 3L camelback by the end of the hike.\nThe last 10% of the hike is legit rock climbing: hand over foot, hoisting yourself up with the help of trees growing between rocks. Which leads me to my next point..Wear closed toe athletic shoes."", 'Total round trip starting at the marina is 6.5 miles.

We all made it to the swimming hole.  Climbing the rocks was a somewhat difficult, we just had to take our time and move slow. Some how on the way back down we missed a blue arrow and got off the main trail.  We ended up on a separate less traveled trail through a lot of over grown brush. Eventually we made it back to the mail trail where it meets at a junction.   For anyone deciding to do this the arrows aren't as clear heading back as they are going up. Definitely worth hiking again."", ""My daughter and I hiked this trail two different years, both times in September. It is a beautiful hike and starts out fairly easy. We were camping at Pinecrest campgrounds and followed the east lake trail to north end of lake. Once there, we crossed a little bridge by an old Boy Scout camping area and began following a trail along the South fork of the Stanislaus River. This was the easy part. Following the arrows painted on granite and the duck piles of stacked rocks we continued missing a few turns and having to backtrack. Soon we began climbing up huge granite rocks; over, around and ; in between them, third class rock scrambling. I hoisted up on my bottom & used my legs to push to next perch. The first time, we could here the waterfalls but couldn't find the final trail area to get to them.  We decided to give up and go back and cool off in the shallow clear river but turned a corner and spotted the duck pile/arrow showing us the way. The swimming hole was so refreshing and we even found a tiny piece of gold in the sand bank of the pool. I transported it back to camp in a piece of hollow licorice! The long walk back  (with uneven footing in many places) was tiring and we almost ran out of water (bring alot and conserve) but I would definitely do it again, which I did the next year."", ""I went on this trail when I had a bad knee. I ended up getting a knee replacement and went back to that trail and I made it. It was so worth it. This was back in the late 90, s. It was beautiful with the waterfall and swimming holes. That was a major accomplishment for me. If I was able to do it, then anybody can. After that we hiked half way around the lake. I'll never forget that day. I made it with a bum knee. I hope to go back again sometimes with my bum back. 2 back surgeries and bars from shoulder blades down to the way lower back."", 'During my Son\'s recent summer visit I really wanted to show them some of the places that I grew up. Cleo\'s was a great choice. The trail is painted with big blue arrows and though I think that they could have been marked a bit differently, the paint was clear and easy to see. Next a new toilet on the backside of the lake was an outstanding addition to this over used recreation area and mountain trail. Bravo Summit Station...  Once on the trail and beyond the boulder ""stairs"" you are quickly rewarded with the main swimming area. At this point you are well past the 1 mile mark, and all I can say is EXPLORE EXPLORE EXPLORE... While the main pool is beautiful, refreshing and easily accessed - up stream and down you\'ll find really great pools to hang out and cool down in. One note; while most people are absolutely sure footed and clearly descended from the mysterious Anasazi , please be mindful of the hazards of bouncing around on our beautiful Sierra granite. Carelessness begets tragedy. Also, this is a heavily traveled trail so please walk softly and carry out all or more than you carried in.

It is intense with steep climbs which makes for a great workout.', 'Beautiful hike. Its relatively moderate unless you are running the trail. Perfect distance. Not too long or short. Bring plenty of water and enjoy this gorgeous trail!!', 'Nice, nearby hike with one steep section. Probably best to go in the early morning and not anytime after it has rained as it would be tough on the downhill.', 'Tough with steep hills. Go in the early morning.', 'Beautiful and lightly challenging.', 'Really great views, but be prepared for some very steep hills that undulate up and down consistently throughout the hike. Bring lots a water. Lots of options to cut the loop short and link up to the paved reservoir loop path below if you keep an eye out - a good option if you need some shade and easier terrain.', 'Fantastic local hike with great views', 'Great moderate walking trail, completely paved with excellent views of the Lafayette Reservoir. All doggies big and small or leashed. And all of them were friendly. Drinking fountains along the way-clean out houses – benches. Next time I go I will take a picnic lunch, sit to  view  the Lafayette reservoir.', 'Did it my friend and were in all wrap coz of little shade. It was a nice area and hilly.', 'Great for a tough hilly run! The second hill (around 2 miles) is the hardest section, but around that are some great rolling hills', 'We started from Paseo Grande Trailhead, hiked up to the Jeep Trail, then to the Rim Trail around the Lafeyette Reservoir. The total distance was 5.2 miles but has some very steep climbs. It was a good hike with some pleasant view.', 'We hiked the Rim Trail here today for our first visit. It was a great workout for me with a few very steep ups and downs.  I think it’s best to do this hike before the summer heat since there is not much shade. The green rolling hills and wildflowers were beautiful!', 'Great trail for an active workout.', 'Lots of rolling up and downs. Path is well groomed but some of the hills are pretty intense', 'A fair number of elevation changes.  One killer hill.  Great views of Lafayette Reservoir and Mt Diablo.  A shorter, paved path directly around the Reservoir is nice for a leisurely stroll.', 'Muddy in the rainy season so be prepared with the right shoes, but so beautiful and unpredictable in the right amount!  It was a good work out too!!  Started on the right side facing the reservoir, at 3:20pm and completed just at sunset.', 'Started on the right side', 'I love this run esp around sunrise or sunset. Pretty challenging with lovely views.', '', 'Dec-2017: This trail is awesome for hill and interval training. It is accurately moderate for the avid runner/hiker. The trail is dry, not too rocky. The views of the reservoir and surrounding hills are refreshing on a brisk sunrise hike. Not too many people early in the morning, especially along the upper rim, you’ll find you have the trail all to yourself. Except of course, the occasional fox will trot by or flock of turkeys making their parade. Definitely a great local trail to regularly visit.', 'Great hike with some moderately challenging slopes!', 'Great hike!  Terrific views.', 'Decided to challenge myself after walking the Reservoir a few times. Gets a little slippery on the really steep parts, but totally doable for a newbie. Great views and easy trail to follow.', 'Great hike, a good combination of sun and shade, some good steep inclines, with flats and downward, pretty views of the reservoir.', 'Not for Mountain Bikes. Description needs to be updated here.', '', ""Some steep hills and not much shade so bring plenty of water. If you've done the reservoir loop and want more of a challenge this is for you. Great views of the reservoir and Mt Diablo."", 'I think this is a tough walk; there are 4 serious hills. With that being said, I LOVE that we have this so near us to do.', 'Great, challenging hike with very steep inclines.  Exposed, not much shade around the Rim Trail. Not sure why this says no dogs - dogs are allowed all throughout the Lafayette Reservoir area but just must be on a leash.', ""I run/hike the rim all the time because it's so darn convenient. It backs up to a neighborhoods a majority of the time, so it doesn't feel like a hike proper, but it's my go-to place as it's close to home. The steepest hill is rough from either direction... long with kinder grades (trailhead near parking lot entrance) v. short & *steep* to the peak (trailhead near lot exit). The view of Mt. Diablo & Briones are lovely + there are usually turkey & deer out in the evening :) I run it in about 65-70 min & hike it with 8lb pack in about 95 min. Adding the sunset trail (the 0.4 area not included on trail map) gives you a little more hill. You can also take trails down to the shore trail and back up again, adding miles and a change of scenery... there are five altogether, three of which are marked."", 'Always had a great work out here!!  Love this trail.', ""It's a good workout 5mi 90min"", 'this trail is beautiful.  there is one brutal hill but no worries there is a bench at the top :).  bring your water and have fun.', 'Sections of the Rim Trail are very steep. Views on a clear day are impressive. Best bet for a good hike is on a sunny cool day.', 'LOVE this trail, I use the PERFECT 5 mile loop from car back to car to train for Spartan races. Going left (from facing the reservoir from the parking lot) gives you what some call ""Cardiac Hill"" - you\'ll know it when you see it, then a gentle downhill for the remainder of the hike, with a couple little uphills thrown in there for funsies.\n\nThe other direction is a more mild hike, with more gradual hills and at least three really steep downhills, so knees beware. \n\nThere IS a water fountain at the top about halfway through the trial from either direction, but I always carry water just in case.', 'I got engaged here.  This will always be 5 stars.', ""It's a good exercise 5 mile loop all hill"", 'This is a moderate hike.  I was with a friend and the hike was over in less than an hour.  Not really crowded, friendly hikers, some dogs.', ""Great hike! I've started by the playground and I've started off the parking lot by the picnic benches. Either way is awesome. Love that there are restrooms at the start and finish and a water fountain by the water tank halfway through."", 'Thoroughly enjoyed our experience here!', 'One of my favs for a booty burner', 'During this rainy Sunday we hiked along the Lafayette Reservoir for two laps; each 2.7 miles for a total of 5.4 miles (under 3 hours). We were fortunate and had a break in the rain. So an ""umbrella"" hike with no umbrella was needed, very enjoyable.', 'Great undulating hill course providing a consistently great workout. Also has several offshoot trails which intersect with the smaller paved lake trail.', 'Nice loop, will probably try it as a run soon.', 'Dogs are allowed on a leash per EBMUD policy:http://www.ebmud.com/recreation/east-bay/lafayette-reservoir/', 'I love the Rim Trail. 5mi is an ideal hike length, the hills are challenging but not impossible, there is a great water fountain halfway around, and every step is beautiful.', 'Challenging hills and beautiful views. Pushes me to the limit but no further.', 'Beautiful and challenging! Definitely wear good hiking boots and bring a camera. Maybe hiking poles too.', 'Very enjoyable trail I did with a friend.  Quite a bit of ups and down but no long sustained hills.  It gets a little traffic but not much as the crowded lower trail.  We saw a lot of deer and waterfowl.  I highly recommend this over the lake trail.', 'A pleasant paved and easy 2.7 miles trail. Most people can walk around this loop in about an hour. The path offers lovely scenery of the surrounding hills covered with virgin oak woods and an abundance of wildlife. A feast for the senses and the soul.', 'We hiked the upper rim of the Lafayette Reservoir. This track is longer than the Lafayette Reservoir Nature Trail  (5 vs. 2.8 miles) and it has some very steep inclines, this is definitely not a beginner’s hike. The trail is a loop and has nice views of the Mt. Diablo and the surrounding areas. Hiking poles are highly recommended for the steep descent on some of the hills. Parking lot at the Lafayette Reservoir has daily entrance fee of $7.00.', 'Kid friendly, dog friendly and people friendly.  One of the most walked places in the bay Area.  Good for all ages and even wheelchairs.  Good to combine with upper trail if fitness allows.', ""We took the Rim Trail from the east side of the parking area to the Campolindo trail, descending down to the Lafayette Nature Trail. Campolindo Trail was very steep! The Nature Trail very busy!  Aside from the good little workout, this trail offers grand views of Mt. Diablo to the east, surrounding residential neighborhoods, and the reservoir itself. I'm looking forward to completing the entire Rim Trail."", 'Easy and scenic trail. Kids friendly.', 'Nice scenic easy trail around the reservoir. Kids friendly.', ""Lafayette Reservoir RIM trail:\nThis is definitely the more challenging and time consuming of the two walks/hikes here.  I would get an early start if a warm day due to exposure.  Very hilly, gravelly....Great work out.  Keeps dogs on leash!\nWouldn't advise in wet or damp weather."", 'If I have done this once, I have done this 1000 times.  This is in my own back yard, Lafayette.  This is very east, a quick ""just shy"" 3 miles around.  We actually start this endeavor in town, walk down Mt. Diablo Blvd and up into the Reservoir staging area, and then go around.  I would go early to avoid the walking traffic, but a very pleasant, chatty crowd.  Lots of seniors, children, power walkers and dogs. Great way to kick start a morning!', ""Great trail for all levels. Paved area leads you out of the parking lot (pay to park $3.00/2 hrs) and to multiple trail heads.  Take the trail on the left at the 0.25 mile mark, for a more challenging hike with inclines, or stay on the paved 2.75 mile loop.  The paved road has a few areas where you can turn off and take some detours with steep inclines.  Great views from the top! It was fairly crowded on a Saturday, and difficult to find parking, but once you're on the trails, it's worth it."", 'I really love this trail, amazing place to run or hike! If you prefer to challenge yourself, definitely do the 4.69  upper Rim trail which is all dirt and up and down hills, it is softer on your feet if you are a runner. The lakeside trail is paved and much easier to run or walk on. Both trails have phenomenal views and nature sounds! Overall a great place to hike or run.', ""Nice stroll around lake edge, up the top it's rather like walking through porridge if it's been raining, fun but slippery"", ""Loved this hike. Have a few spare hours? Easy morning hike! The paved way is definitely easier around the reservoir than the trail up into the hills but both are beautiful in it's own way! Challenge yourself and go clockwise up. I find it more challenging. Or go counter clockwise for an easier climb."", 'Easy', 'Very crowded down near the lake but less so up on the rim trail. Fairly bland scenery, but a nice easy walk.', 'Excellent midday walk!', 'Awesome! Easy not so much some steep hills and great workout! Love it!', 'Nice trail for great leg workout. Steep declines 8-9 in some spots and 5s for inclines.', 'It was slippery and not well sign posted but beautiful and very quiet compared to the paved loop around the reservoir.', 'Nice walk with the dog. Just a couple of slight hills. Trail around lake is paved. There are also trails that lead off into the hills- unsaved.  Parking costs $$.  Annual membership available.', 'While this is a great trail - it is misnamed. The lower trail (here) is the Lakeside Nature Trail. \nThe Upper Rim Trail is a completely different experience. Dirt fire trail, crazy hilly, and 2 miles longer.', 'Busy and beautiful!', 'Not bad.', ""We walk the lower 2.7 mile loop almost every day. Typically we bring our pug Henry and our ShiTsu BooBoo for a shorter walk for their morning constitutional. Then we do the whole loop in about 52 minutes. Occasionally, we hike the rim trail which is not paved and is about five miles long for the entire loop. More importantly, the upper rim trail involves an elevation gain of 1200'---1400' with some very steep hills along the route. When we hike the entire rim trail it takes us about two hours. The scenery from many points along the route is awesome especially on a clear and sunny day.Over the years, we've become addicted to this fabulous and rejuvenating location. Aside from the natural beauty of this Reservoir with its myriads of wild life and virgin oak trees, the lower loop is frequented by people of all ages and dogs of all breeds."", 'Jogged the paved  loop close to the lake, then walked it again. 2.7 or so.  Next time will try the rim trail.', ""Great trail, it's nice that you can choose to go up to the Rim trail to lengthen the hike. Great natural landscape, but we went on Sunday morning and the trail around the reservoir is quite crowded!"", 'This was a nice hike, if I could give any advice it would be to wear good shoes, there are a lots of hills on a dirt path.', 'I grew up with this trail. The Rim trail has great views!', 'Amazing', 'Easy beautiful trail for the whole family.  Bring a picnic too!', 'Nice scenic trail around the lake; also took one of the half mile side trails around part of the rim; hilly in parts but not overly strenuous.', 'Such a beautiful easy hike. Definitely recommend!', 'Nice easy trail for walking the dog on leash.', 'Decent day hike.  A great one for families as I think young children would be able to complete most of the hike on their own and feel very successful.', ""Great local spot. Spent a sunny Mother's Day 2014 here and needless to say the parking lot was packed.  FYI, and there is a small fee to get in.  That being said, Lafayette Reservoir boasts some pretty nice facilities: plenty of picnic tables, wide trails, and a visitor center that also hosts tours and educational camps.  There are two main trails here, the outer Rim Trail, and Reservoir trail that hugs the water for about 3 miles.  Rim Trail is markedly tougher with great variations in altitude, Reservoir Trail is much friendlier for a wider variety of skill levels and is mainly a paved fire road.  This is a popular destination for families and runners around the Lafayette/Orinda area so things can get a bit crowded at times, otherwise nice way to spend some time outdoors without going to far from home."", ""We had our third Meetup at the Lafayette Reservoir today and I loved the walk! Most of the trail was paved and it was busy with walkers, runners and bikers on the trail. What other reviews have seem to skipped on are the abundance of picnic spaces! There even was a play structure located right off of the parking lot. I think this spot will be a regular place for our group to meet as it was a beautiful walk! AbbyOrganizer of Concord's Young Adult Outdoor Adventurists Grouphttp://www.meetup.com/cyaoag/"", 'Beautiful easy loop. Cemented, but enough dirt to run on follows the edge loop. Beautiful scenery quite exposed to sunshine. Few little inclines, great for a quick run!', ""The outer loop makes for a nice outing. It's about 5miles and there is a place to fill up on water along the trail which is nice! Trail is full of people if all ages and many people with their pooches. Bring money for parking!"", 'A quick jaunt around the reservoir, perfect for all ages. Trails are well maintained and are avidly used for walking and running. Crowds are thick.\n\nNote: there is a fee to park.', 'We hike this trail at least twice a week and it is a very great trail. It takes us an hour and 40 minutes (walking) if we park by the meters. There is street parking down on Mount Diablo Blvd and it is an extra 1 mile round trip to the trail. The trail begins behind the fish cleaning station (which is to the right of the parking lot if you are facing the water). It is a loop. It is  great cardio. People who go to the gym say that it gives them a run for their money and it does. It is constant up and down, can be slippery when really dry--crumbled dirt and when it is very wet hard to navigate--clay mud sticks to your feet. You definitely need good tread on your shoes for this one. 1/2 way there is a water tower with water available. When it is foggy it is very cold, and when it is hot it is very hot.  If you start behind the playground, it is the harder way to go. The uphill is much more strenuous. But either way it is a great workout and will keep you in shape! The paved trail below is ok. very crowded. Lots of dogs and strollers. Takes about 40 minutes.', 'Lafayette Res is my ""quick hit"" place to go hiking or running. I live just a quick drive away so it is really convenient for me. The Rim Trail is a nice moderate loop with some pretty good inclines. Downsides to the Res are paying for parking (there are quarter only meters, you can pay $6 per day to park in the lot, or you can become an annual member but thats like hundred bucks) and this place is often pretty crowded. I have a better time here when I hike the Rim Trail as opposed to running on the paved path on busier days.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '',

I believe this trail has a sign that says ""No Dogs"" but I always see lots of dogs on trail.   Last time I was on her to MSJ I saw a baby rattlesnake.   Great small hike.', 'All incline so be ready to up hill it - it ends meeting up with several trail junctions so there are options to keep on with another trail with less incline. Beautiful views! And close to town center.', 'Just came off this trail. it has a well earned ""moderate"" rating as it is approximately 2.6 miles of constant grade from the trailhead the saddle.Trail is well maintained, switchbacks are well graded.

We really enjoyed the views going up, the trail to me seemed pretty narrow in many areas. I only say that because I like to walk with lots of space, we did stop to eat our snacks which consisted of turkey jerky, dried bananas, and trail mix nuts. we love our water packs which we both did not finish, my pack holds a 2 liter capacity. oatmeal is my staple to eat before a hike, it really helps my energy level to stay pretty high. but that is just what I do, there are many other foods that are great before a hike. Be safe and have a great time hiking.', 'This trail had been too busy in the past and now it requires a permit to hike it. Make sure you get your permit early in the day at the ranger station. They only issue 20 permits per day and they are gone quickly. You also need to buy a parking pass at the ranger station, except you own a Nationalpark pass already.A ranger is watching the entrance of the trail and will check your permit and also make sure that dogs are on leash.The hike is beautiful. I only made it to the saddle junction, because I didn’t have enough time. Walking a steady paste it took me 1hr 20min to do the 2.4 miles and 1800 feet elevation to the junction. Going back was faster. Roundtrip roughly 2.5 hrs.To complete the hike there’s another 1.7 miles roundtrip from the junction that I wasn’t able to do that day.However me and my dog enjoyed the hike a lot.

Beautiful and even with the temps warming up to high 80s in town it stayed cool enough up here especially in the shade. Trail very well maintained!  Lots of backpackers coming down.  Parking was full for a late morning arrival so if you're planning to go up, hit the Ranger station for your permit and adventure pass earlier in the morning.  We got the last spot.  Enjoyed lunch afterwards in the park where there were a couple picnic tables."", 'great views along trail. A little difficult, but worth it all the way up and down stopping A lot to talk to other hikers', 'Gorgeous and challenging!!! Will definitely be back to do it again soon!!', 'Hikes it on 4/7/2018 This is my new favorite hike! It’s so beautiful! Very enjoyable hike. Parking was very easy. Lots of dogs on the trail and very friendly people. The trail was very well maintained and easy to follow.  It was fun to talk to all the PCT hikers on the way up. We ate on the large boulder which marks the end of this trail and some hikers convinced  us to continue to Tahquitz Peak which is not that much further.  Make sure you put this on your list of hikes!', ""This trail is super cool! Very well kept, beautiful views of Tahquietz Peak and  Suicide Rock. Lot's of shade, switch backs and goes around mountain. Great workout! Make sure to get your Adventure pass, and requires permits at Ranger station."", 'Beautiful day out. Light snow and ice on the round made it air slippery on some spots. Once we made it to the junction it was even more beautiful and a great place to take some time to relax.', ""We backpacked this trail on Feb 16, 2018 and it was definitely a steep long trail. Most people do not backpack this route and I can see why. It's really uphill most of the way and carrying 40+lbs on your back is rough. With that said this 49 year old and her friends and kids (ages 13 and 14) did great. We slept just near Saddle jct about 500 yds north on the PCT. There were patches of snow, and it was cold at night (down in the 25 degrees) If you plan to hike to the peak anytime soon bring microspikes as there is too much ice to hike without them. \n\nThe view was really lovely, but I won't be hiking this one again. Next time I'll stick with less uphill trails as I'm still learning to pack a lighter pack :) \nHappy Hiking!"", 'Enjoyable hike. Weather cool and snow on ground and trees as we approached Saddle Junction. Round trip to Saddle Junction took 4 hrs including frequent stops for photos and resting at Saddle Junction.', ""Nice trail, well maintained. It was fairly busy, I brought my dog and she loved it! Don't forget a permit from the ranger station, and dogs should be leashed.Neither my dog or myself is in great shape and we took it slow. 1hr 45 minutes to the saddle and 1.5hr down the hill. The time includes rest stops and time to chat with other hikers."", 'Did this hike today and it was busy but still enjoyable. We took the teenagers and dog with us and everyone did well. You can feel the altitude going up which made it a bit challenging for us ocean dwellers but was worth it. I would like to go out farther next time. Remember to wear layers!', 'A beautiful hike with 1” of fresh snow. Will do it again.', 'Well maintained steady climb to the saddle. I would rate this on the high end of moderate.', 'Highly recommend this hike! The trail was crowded and it\'s uphill the whole way. Good to note there is no final ""view"" where the trail meets Saddle Junction. Took 2 hours, moving at a quick pace.', ""Took an older group of Boy Scouts (14-17 yr olds).  Got there early on a Saturday morning and had no problem finding a parking spot.  It was about 36 degrees when we started.  But early on in the hike we were able to shed all our extra gear and we're quite comfortable in shorts and a T-shirt because of the strenuous climb and the speed at which the boys wanted to tackle this mountain!  You are in the shade most of the hike, which was great.  The views are awesome throughout the hike and the best is at the fire lookout house.  What an amazing piece of history very well restored!  Not and easy hike but not too hard.  Moderate is the right ranking for this trail!  going to do it again with my family!"", 'Amazing views along the hike, but no payoff view at the junction.  You’ll have to hike further on another trail for that', 'Great hike got there later in the day but was still a great day, the hike was all uphill with lots of great views excited to come back', 'Amazing views along entire trail. There is no water at the bathroom at the trail head so come prepared.', 'I love this place', 'Great hike with beautiful views. Going to feel it tomorrow. Continued to Pacific Crest Trail for half a mile then climb rocks to the east to see views of the value. Definitely worth it to make it to the top. Peak was at 8,500.', 'Beautiful this trail leads to other trails we completed Tahquitz peak from this trail', 'incredible views, well maintained trail. our only regret was that we didn’t have time to go further once we hit saddle junction.', ""Great trail to do at midnight fir a Halloween Challenge. That's exactly what we did. It was easy to find and very easy to follow. It was the first of three trails we did that day. After this went to Suicide Rock then finished of with Devil's Peak (I don't recommend devil's Peak cause the trail is over grown with briars)  I'm definitely going back for a day hike and possibly continue on through to San Jacinto Peak"", 'Great trail. Just hard enough to feel like you’ve really done something but still very accessible.', 'Hike was good and has some good views of the area. You need a permit do this hike from the Ranger station just down the road. Also if you want to park in humber park trailhead that requires a parking permit which costs $5 and you can get that from ranger station or any big stores around Idyllwild.', ""Went with my daughter's volleyball team.  I loved the trail, it was steep but i loved it.  Still sore, but was worth it.  Will definitely head up these trails again soon."", ""Great hike going up to Saddle Junction. Untrained hikers will probably experience this hike as hard,  because there are a few steep parts. From Saddle Junction you can continue to Taquitz Peak, which adds another 2 miles (one way) to the hike. We didn't do that,  because we ran out of time. It took us about 3 hours to compete this hike (up to the junction and back). You have great views of the park. We saw some small wildlife like squirrels, birds and lizards."", 'Beautiful groomed hike. Steady climb means a good workout!', 'Was a beautiful hike. Trails were great. Views awesome. And fern canyon was magical', 'This is a beautiful hike on a nice trail! Sun and shade. Some rocks, and is definitely moderate. You gain a lot of elevation! We are novice hikers, so it was a challenge! Worth the beautiful views.', 'Great trails. Decent, not great views. Good cover from the sun.', 'Despite the name this is an extremely well maintained trail with fantastic views.', ""We drove up from Palm Springs to escape the heat and arrived about 7:30. The ranger station in Idyllwild opens at 8, so we had time to enjoy excellent coffee and scones at Idyllwild Bake Shop and Brew, a block away. Only 30 permits  (1 per group) are issued daily for the hike, so get there early. Several rangers checked our permit on the trail. You need a $5 parking pass for the lot, which you buy at the ranger station. We only hiked to Saddle Junction because of time. Next time we'll go 1 1/2 miles further to  to Taquitz Peak lookout for the great views."", '', 'I would have love to rate this hike but unfortunately we were not able to hike this trail due to the requirement of a permit. Make sure to arrive early because parking fills up and you also need to purchase a parking pass which we had no idea you needed one. We drove into the town of Idyllwild to purchase one for $5 but no one told us we needed to obtain a permit from the ranger to hike this trail. I guess now we know. Hopefully next time I can give it a real review.', ""Had not done this hike in a long while .  Is still very steep dusty and hot in the afternoon .  They still have so much of the park closed do to the fire a few yrs ago so the hiking after Saddle is limited if you don't get an early start .  And all the fallen and dead trees is kinda depressing"", ""Great hike with perhaps the most consistently amazing view I've seen from a hike in so cal. The saddle junction ain't much, but it's still great. Remember to stop at the ranger station first for a wilderness permit!"", ""Mother's day hike. Returning after 40 years. Sad part is, I live so close to this trail. Beautiful day."", ""Beautiful hike, hadn't done it in about 9 years.  Took our time going up, made it back down in 1:15.   Lots of streams flowing, amazing vistas.   Rangers thought there would be streams running through July."", 'Moderately up then back down the same relentless big water bars and stones. Great views including Suicide Rock and Lily Rock.', 'Just what we were looking for in a hike! Springs, vistas, crazy beautiful trees n rocks, and even melting snowpacks toward the top. A moderate challenge that delivered breathtaking views for my 12 year old daughter. Another positive experience on the road to getting her hooked in the outdoors.', ""Hiked this today and it was fabulous!  Yes, there is a bit of snow over the last mile and definitely in the saddle area but it wasn't icy more like soft and fall through in some places!  Loved the views of Suicide Rock and Tahquitz Peak!  We loved this hike.  I will say that the ranger kind of discouraged us from hiking this as it would be icy but glad we did it!"", 'If you are going on this trail as of march it is a wise idea to bring trekking poles and crampons, especially if you are trying to get to the PCT in saddle junction, which has about three feet of snow in many spots. This hike takes around three hours round trip and is probably the best hike in the area.', 'amazing trail wont regret  it!!!! just as in FYI you do need a parking permit as well as a permit to hike the trail as it states on the billboard.', '8200ft elevation, covered in snow as of feb 26. Was beautiful. Will come back!', 'Had a wonderful hike. Wore our yaketrak shoes', 'awesome', 'gorgeous hikenfrom Himber Park, made it to the second waterfall but the ice was too thick and we had to turn back. look forward to going to Saddle Junction and beyond in the spring', 'Pretty nice trail, strenuous but not too bad, great workout.', 'Beautiful views; fun hike', 'I hiked this trail as part of my trek to Tahquitz summit. As a standalone hike to go visit the junction, it is a good one. I saw a rattlesnake on the way back, uphill from the trail and stretched out. Just a reminder to keep watch as you hike.', 'This trail is best hiked in the early morning hours.  Sections of the trail are quite exposed.  It is a great jumping off point to many trails once you reach the junction including access to the PCT.', 'one of my best trails, moderately hard, but the view as you go p is beautiful.  once you are at the junction, there are so many other trails you can explore on.', 'This was my second trip up the Devil\'s Slide Trail. From the trailhead to Saddle Junction is about 2.66 miles. I added another 1.5 miles by heading south along the PCT to Chinquapin Flats. Had lunch there and then headed back. I ended up with 8.11 miles for the day. The Devil\'s Slide Trail is certainly challenging and offers ""almost"" grueling switchbacks. The portion of the PCT I took was easy to moderate (at times). Great morning hike! The Tahquitz Peak Lookout is only another half mile SW on the South Ridge Trail.', 'Went for my first time on a Saturday and to my suprise there was an almost full parking lot at 0745. Saw many people on the way up and down. Very nice views and still had a little snow on the top.  Several miles up got stopped by Rangers (volunteers) and Jeff said I did not have his permission to be here because I was unaware of the permit required. I nicely explained he can carry me down then  because I plan on making it to the top which I did :)', 'Beautiful conifers. Plenty of bird watching opportunities. Uphill all the way to Saddle Junction.', 'Snowing the entire way down. Very cool but a little slippery and harder overall than expected.', 'Chilly in February - plenty of snow, but doable with a day pack and hiking boots (we saw others with snow cleats & trekking poles).  We hiked noon to 3:30 pm in workout pants, tee shirts & windbreaker jackets.  Gorgeous, not TOO  strenuous hike.  Spots were challenging due to snow and obstacles, but very enjoyable!', ""I do this one a lot for the workout.  When there is a threat of rain, early morning fog and crisp breeze its the best. Not too many hikers in these conditions on the weekends.  Quiet and serene. In perfect sunny weather, there is a lot of foot traffic. Don't forget your day hiking permit."", ""It's was a wonderful hike. Challenging because there was a lot of snow and ice. The trail was slippery but still able to hike. It took about 1 hour and 25 minutes to hike to the top. Beautiful views during the hike. I was a little disappointed because I thought we were going to reach a peak for a view, but instead led us to move trails which would have been nice if the weather permitted. Would definitely do it again."", 'Steady climb to saddle junction and well worth it ! The views are spectacular looking down on Idyllwild.', 'Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous. Great place to enjoy the wonderful autumn season.', ""Great views but It's not an easy hike. With the high elevation, rocky and gradual incline, I wouldn't recommend it unless you're in good shape. Can be really dangerous when iced. Only hiked about 1.5 miles up this time, but will go further again soon. You do need a permit from the ranger station but it's free."", 'I started my hike up at about 0700. A little chilly, but not bad at all. There was no one on the trail or at Saddle Junction when I got there. I had to force myself to slow down several times in an effort to avoid the potential of getting elevation sickness. I normally hike at levels under 2000 feet and mostly sea level. I definitely felt the thinner air, but had no problems with the hike. I made it to Saddle Junction by 0819. Took about a 15 minute break to eat and explore and then headed down. My total hiking time was 2 hr 21 min. I could hear the rock climbers shouting as I was hiking. Beautiful trail, lots of wildlife. My only complain would be that I had to stop, pick up a very heavy, plastic water bottle that someone must have ""accidently"" dropped on the trail. Yes I put it in my pocket, carried it down the trail to be placed in recycling where it belongs. I can rant for a while about this, but all I will say is, ""Pack it in, Pack it out!"" After my hike I drove over to the Marion Mountain Trail and hiked the firs half mile to get an idea of the trail. I will be hiking with a group from the Marion Mtn Trail to the Peak next Sunday. Can\'t wait!!', 'Forgot to record, but it was a wonderful hike to fit in after driving up to Idyllwild from San Diego !  Went with 10 and 13 year old boys -  perfect distance', ""It's beautiful. It goes back & forth from rough terrain to just dirt.  I wouldn't say it's an easy hike.  If you're fit & workout daily you'll be fine. I think I did the minor up hill grade to the Saddle Junction in an hr & 45 mins. Started out slow with a friend and had to leave her at her own pace and I had my dog with me. I started up Round Valley after reaching the Saddle Junction, but didn't go all the way due to my friend down below. I did learn that you can do Round Valley towards San Jacinto Peak with your dog, but there is a stopping point where the dogs can go no more.  Great well marked trail. Have to have a stamped permit to do the Devils Slide now, but if you hike during the week or after Labor Day weekend, you just fill out a permit app and toss it in the slot.   So glad I decided on this trail."", 'Really great trail! Got caught in a thunderstorm, powerful! Great views, beautiful trail!', 'Beautiful hike with dramatic views of Suicide Rock, Tahquitz Peak/Lilly Rock, and the entire Strawberry Creek ""bowl"".  We hiked it August 7, 2015 with a couple of dogs and kept a slow and steady pace with a lot of water breaks for the dogs, so we were about 2 1/2 hours up, and 1 1/4 down (with a lot of photo stops too!).  Fair bit of open trail so there\'s the potential for this to be a hot hike, but the mountain breeze kept everything (and everybody) cool.  The elevation gain is even and steady. Your payoff for the hike up is an awesome lunch spot at Saddle Junction - it\'d be worth it to bring a lightweight blanket up. Make sure you get your Devil\'s Slide hiking permit at the Idyllwild Ranger Station - we ran into the Ranger 15 minutes into our hike, but had the permit in the pocket and the dogs on leash!!', ""Not a bad hike at all. Make sure to bring tons of water and watch for snakes. It doesn't get too crowded, which is nice and I didn't see any bikers on the trail. Make sure you pay attention to the elevation and how your feeling. Elevation sickness is easy to get, just be careful and take your time. Rangers are awesome! You need a permit to hike Devils Slide, which is free. Go to the actual ranger station to get it. You will also need a parking pass to park at Humber Park, I think it was $5. Please follow the rules, all the rangers are volunteers...and every donation counts. I recommend this trail!"", 'Sierra-worthy views, flowers, birds. Truly a moderate hike, but respect it and allow more time.  Get a day-use parking pass at the National Forest office in Idyllwild (closed Wed/Thur) or use your annual Adventure Pass.  Self register anytime for the free day-use hiking pass in front of the National Forest office or across the street at the state park office - either pass is honored for day-use of this trail and all those above.', ""A well-maintained trail and worth the climb. It is definitely a moderate climb and takes some time if you're not in peak physical condition. We kept a pretty brisk pace and it took us 1hr 45 min up and a little over an hour on the way down. A good trail for dogs, but beware to keep them leashed as we got busted by a ranger for not doing so.  the saddle is a nice quiet place for a lunch break, but the best views are on your way up!"", ""Beautiful hike, was huffing and puffing and got altitude sickness, but it was bearable & worth pushing myself to finish. Met some really nice hikers along the way, some adorable dogs. Saw deer, squirrels, chipmunks, neat plants and flowers I've never seen before, gnarly trees ... Saddleback Junction smells really good and is a refreshing and quiet place to chill before heading back down. Had lunch at Lake Fulmor afterwards to end the day. great first experience in Idyllwild. I would recommend getting to the trail head before 9am as parking fills up pretty fast by then. don't forget to get your parking pass ($5), and permit (free) @ the ranger station before heading to the trail head."", 'Hiked up Devils slide to Sadle junction and then took teh PCt for a while.  Beautify hike, great views of the valley, and met some great people.  Lite crowd on the trail this day.', ""My wife is an experienced Filipina climber, but she had not hiked for some time. She hiked to the top of Devil's Slide and thoroughly enjoyed it, took a photo of the snow on the ground and joined other happy hikers on the way back down. Next time - to the Saddle and onward to the top."", ""Good hike with nice views.  It's been a dry year, but there was still snow on the upper portions of the trail.  Slick in some areas.  Other hikers told us Tahquitz peak was inaccessible.  Thought we'd get some pct miles in but it was all snow at the saddle so we enjoyed some lunch and headed back."", 'Nice trail, great views. In December upper portion was quite icy making the return trip difficult.', 'Great place for summit training.', ""Nice hike. I went a day after it snowed. very pretty walking through the snow line.On the way down I got nice pictures of mountain lion tracks that weren't there on the way up."", ""This is a great trail for any time of the year if you have the right gear. One trip early spring, I forgot  my crampons and couldn't make the saddle due to the icy trail. It was a nice trip anyway. Definitely make sure you have the wilderness permit and stick to your plan."", 'It was so good to be hiking on this trail again. Last year there was only access to Taquitz from here. Now we can hike up to San Jacinto. It was very beautiful   Nothing seemed effected by the fires on this trail.', 'Great hike! Our first visit to Idyllwild--but please note: on Mar 24 2014. In other words, the ""June"" early date given for this hike seems way out of reality, at least for some years. There was a few little patches snow at the top from a rainfall about 3 weeks prior but hardly any. But very worthwhile for all the reasons given in other reviews here. We were out and back in about 2.5 hours but stopping to take photos and getting a bite.', ""We love this hike. Challenging and a definite workout. Gorgeous views. In the off season it's quiet and peaceful but gets very chilly. You do need a permit and adventure pass. Don't forget your trekking poles and a picnic."", 'Devil\'s Slide Trail is one of my ""backyard trails"", and it is wonderful, if a bit crowded at times. I\'ve hiked it many times. It offers the fastest way to get into the high-country and wilderness areas out of Idyllwild. The views are amazing, the three creeks that cross the trail often have water (except in summer), and it is a good snowshoe trail as well, especially the morning after - or during - a big snowfall. This trail was not affected by the Mountain Fire and is open.', 'Just to clarify: you need an Adventure Pass to park, but you also need a PERMIT to hike this trail. They are two different things, FYI.', 'Devils slide trail is the path that leads to San Jacinto.  It is my all time favourite way to get to the summit.\nThis is a long way....I believe 16mi return trip but the beauty of the forest is worth it and the destination is grand.  There isnt a lot of water until you get near Wellman Divide. Usually there is a flowing stream there.  In early Spring this part of the trail can be very wet!! Dont forget your permit! Obtain one in Idyllwild before you head out.  Limited access to San Jacinto during the summer months.  Bag it!!', 'Lots of rocks. Mostly shaded trail. The challenge is about gaining altitude on a already high base. The starting point (Humber Park) is at 6500 ft above sea level and saddle junction is at about 8000 ft level. ', 'The family headed up a few months ago. Great time, kids had a blast as well as me and my wife. We will be doing this one again.', ""I have been using devils slide to access all the trailheads at the top. Gettig to it or comming back I use Erney Maxwell trail from home right outside of Idyllwild. After hiking around back there for a few days it's great to get on devils slide becouse it's more open to the valley after being in the forest at the top.going up it's also a great warm up for things to come.The story goes that back in the start of the century the cowboys would drive there cattle up there to high pasture and the old trail was so steep that many cowboys and cattle fell to there death as they drove them straight up the mountain so it came to be called devils slide it's said that after devils slide was turned into a bunch of switchbacks the name should be turned into Angels walk, ha ha anyway it's a great trail I never get tired of it and there is always some water to filter about 1/2 way down."", ' Great warm up for the rest of the mountain. One of my favorite trails to do during the week.', ' Lots of scenery, we took plenty of pictures along the way. Saw two rattle snacks that day.. But be aware that horse go through there, so that means plenty of droppings LOL . I twas a nice day out side good hike along the way to Tahquitz Peak.', ""I was trying find Ernie maxwell trail couldn't find it and found this one. It was my first hike since the marines and I had my two dogs. It was there first hike too. I talked to a couple other hikers and they said it nice easy hike. So went up the trail and ran into another hiker they said we were almost there and before I knew it we made up. I like trail very much not alot of traffic on the trail. We did come across a rattlesnake along the trail other than that it great. Make sure to get permit and a adventure pass or better yet get Annual its well worth it."", ""I hiked this in April when there was still plenty of snow covering most of the trail.

We exactly followed the route in the app, and my new Garmin GPS has the distance at 11.6 miles, which is longer than the advertised 9.8. The vertical gain is spot on.

Made it up to MtLowe during a really cool foggy day. No way of judging most of  the views due to the fog. Soon after the parking area you will come across a nice tunnel made in the 1940s.

It's definitely worth it to go the entire way if you have time, the views are amazing at inspiration point and the trail is empty and quiet the second half of the way.

The trails are pretty well maintained besides a couple of downed trees... I also think for anyone prepared and that has backcountry trail knowledge, this isn't that confusing of a loop or network of trails. There are signs at every junction. Just be smart, take a map or remember to keep your phone on airplane mode cause your GPS will still work on Google Maps. ;)"", 'Wow, what a enjoyable walk!', 'I love this area but it’s easy to get lost because there are so many trails and roads. It is not moderate, it is hard if you are not in good shape! Road/trails are a steady incline but so worth it. For those asking about the swing: once you get to the campground, you will see 2 white signs. Hike between them (trail is on the right). After a short distance you will meet up with the road again. Take Sam Merrill trail east or west (there are signs) to get to the top of Mt. Lowe. I took West because it looked easier to navigate (the trial is slightly hidden by a log and I walked right past it. Look for the sign). Gorgeous views and a cool little swing. 18 miles total for me, using sunset ridge to start the hike. I uploaded the funky little map I saw, which is pretty accurate!', 'Very great hike.

The bugs were awful. I was eaten alive by bitting flies. Bug spray is a must this time of year. Be prepared for the hike back down to your car.

You are very exposed through most of the trail. The incline isn\'t bad but all of the reviews and articles I\'ve read about this trail greatly underestimate how much of it is uphill. The first half is pretty but the scenery stays pretty much the same all the way to Inspiration Point. The portion of the trail between Inspiration Point and Echo Mountain is an easy and comfortable descent and it is easily the most beautiful and interesting portion in the hike. Once you finish exploring Echo Mountain the path splits into like five different trails. Be careful; it can be very confusing. Once you finally find the right trail prepare yourself for yet another daunting uphill climb, followed by a knee busting descent back down the concrete road you came up at the start of the trail.Also....cyclists.....cyclists everywhere.', 'Beautiful hike, lots of wildflowers. There are lots of alternate ways to do this hike. We went up the creek in Millard Canyon, and it was a great choice.. a little longer and a steep climb up, but beautiful.', 'This was the first hike I did this year on Jan 2nd.  Great hike.', 'We usually take this the opposite direction, starting up towards Echo Mountain, then on up to Inspiration Point via the Castle Canyon trail then back down the Sam Merrill trail rather than the fire road. The area is really beautiful. Keep your eyes/ears open for cyclists.', ""Great trail,  it's well maintained for most of the hike and is pretty clearly marked.  Just make sure you save the main turn points so you don't get confused! It's a hike and a history lesson! Took me around 4:30 for the whole trail having to park outside the gate to the road because it doesn't open til after 6am"", ""such beautiful views! it's a steady incline which helps with the hike!"", 'Loved this trail!', 'It was a spectacular hike with amazing vistas.  We went after a rain and the clouds were beautiful. This upside down hike amazes.', ""My dad and I did a variation on this loop. We started at the Cobb Estate/Sam Merrill trail head. The Sam Merrill trail up to Echo mountain was in good condition, but was very crowded. The view from Echo Mountain and the remains of the hotel and machinery was interesting. From Echo Mountain we tool the long way to Inspiration Point via the railway trail. Trail is wide, but pretty empty after Echo Mountain. Lunch in the shade at Mt Lowe Trail Camp. Back down the railway, we went down Dawn Mine trail, which wasn't in the best condition. There were a few stretches where we debated turning back. A hiking stick would have been good to have. The Dawn mine was interesting, and there was lots of flowing water in the creek. Going down the Milliard Canyon trail was not as fun after all of the nice trails. Lots of hoping down rocks and climbing under trees. We missed the turn-off to the Sunset Ridge trail, but caught it after a brief scramble just above the falls. Ended at Chaney trail head and got a ride back to our car."", ""The views are fantastic, and as said, the side trails can get you to an amazing overlook. The history is interesting too.  Best done after rattlesnakes are away, or at least be super cautious\n - for I've sure seen a big one up there on the trail."", ""Beautiful place! At the end it's a Good spot to take a break and have a few sandwiches."", ""I didn't do the full loop I just hiked from the fire road entrance on Chaney Trail Rd. all the way up to Echo Mountain I have to say it's a bit challenging just because sometimes there's no where to go when the bikers come down sometime.  I arrived at 930 on saturday to the fire road entrance and it wasn't packed they mentioned you don't need a parking pass I think you'll need an adventure pass if you decide to camp."", 'Had a great hike. The side trails are fantastic.', ""This trail has something for everyone.  It was very challenging to do this on a mountain bike.  I started in the morning during a weekday so I didn't run into very many hikers.  (wow, that sounds bad) I didn't encounter very many hikers.  The views on this trail are amazing if the sky is clear, which is another reason to start this in the morning."", ""I've done this hike a few times all the way to Echo Mountain and back up to the Red Box area.  Best done in late fall, winter and early spring before it gets too hot as it's mostly west facing and not fun to do in the heat. Mostly downhill all the way down and uphill all the way back.\n\nBring snacks or a lunch and LOTS of water for you and your dogs. Gets rather crowded at times at least to the Mt. Lowe viewpoint, then the day hikers drop off a bit. However, this trail is well supported so if you bring your dogs be sure they are socialized and friendly with other dogs, otherwise keep them on a leash and controlled.\n\nI have not hiked it since the Station Fire so can't speak to the current watershed but most areas are in recovery from the damage.\n\nThe hike is about 11 to 12 miles so be sure you are up for it."", ""I did this hike via Echo Mtn-Castle Canyon-East Mt. Lowe trail.  The GPS clocked it in at just over 12 miles total with 3750 ft of elevation gain.  The hike was much prettier and more enjoyable after getting through the crowd on the Echo Mountain trail (though everyone we encountered was very friendly).  This is a great training hike for bigger peaks or longer treks.  I was tired at the end for sure.  It was very misty from Inspiration Point on up, which turned into rain, so I can't comment on the views but I definitely felt like I accomplished something worthy of enjoying a burger and 2 beers afterwards.  It was enjoyable enough that I would do this a hike again on a clearer day.  Trails were easy to follow and well kept The signage is pretty clear but I'd recommend bringing a map just in case because there are several turn offs."", 'Watch out for poison oak! Not fun.

Did a total of 9.25 miles going up and back down. Theres a loop you can take but i did not look for it so i just cane back down the same way i went up. Bring plenty of water and a small snack. Took us about 3 1/2 hours maybe a bit longer. We got there at 6:30am and there were hikers already waiting for the gate to be opened. I would have to say it's the best time to come if you don't want to catch the busy time which would be around 11am, non-stop hikers going up! So 6:30am guys would do it!

Went up this trail at 8pm came back down 11pm and was so enjoyable. Amazing views from the top!"", ""I'm rating 3 because YOU NEED PARKING PASS (which was not mentioned anywhere I read), and IT'S BETTER TRAIL FOR BIKES THAN HIKERS. It's all basically single trail.. narrow paths. Also not as pretty as it seems. Like I said.. bikes would be better.\n\nNot lots of people though.. which we always like. Trails are confusing and hard to find where to go. \n\nDOG: make sure it's a dog used to hiking.. otherwise you'll find yourself needing to go back sooner because the dog can't take it."", ""The railway parts are amazing!

I can honestly say the only other time I saw such a view of LA was from a plane. Would suggest doing it early morning or later in the afternoon. Also, if you'd like to just go to Mt.

Nice steady climb.   Not easy for kids.  Great views.', ""I enjoyed every bit of this trail, although the trail leading up to Echo Mtn. was very busy it was still fun.

Using Echophone and exploring the remains of 'White City' was fun. We made a mistake later, with less water and food, we started going towards Inspiration Point via the Castle Canyon Trail (just before reaching Echo Mountain, you will see the board). The trail to Inspiration point is very narrow and not properly made. It is a very risky forest unending trail requires a hiking cane for sure. Don't sit near the trees, ants will start biting you. Tip: Don't loose hope. We took 2 hrs to cover 2.5 miles till the Inspiration point (all my friends gave up in between). Its just a great view up there. And, if you hike another 2.5 miles, you reach Mt. Lowe (which we could have never done). Carry 3 liters of water (2 liters was less for me for round trip from Inspiration pt.) and Granula Bars (gives you energy)."", ""This was my first time hiking with my girlfriend and I have to say this is a great introduction trail. I am a total hiking noob so I didn't bring the proper clothing along for the hike up (basketball shorts is a no no). We went up around 4 or so in the afternoon so we got to see the sunset over the mountains and got to see an amazing view of Pasadena and Los Angeles. If you are interested in introducing someone too hiking, this is the perfect trail to start. You will see a great view! One quick tip though. If you are climbing down at night be sure to bring an LED flashlight because it gets dark and creepy!

There was water in the river and great weather, all around good hike and the kids loved it.', 'awesome hike! there was water in the river and we saw 2 rams.  beautiful palm trees at the end!', 'Awesome! We saw 2 rams and lots 9f water flowing.', 'Great family friendly hike. In December the temps are great. We packed a lunch and spent the afternoon exploring. We came across a jack rabbit, hawk, and a pair of hummingbirds.', ""Peaceful walk and beautiful scenery. The trail is blocked off towards the end of the trail right now it seems. It is also easy to lose the trail if you're not paying complete attention. But overall it is a lovely way to spend some hours."", 'A really nice hike, moderate in length and fairly flat. The oasis at the end was beautiful and peaceful.', ""This is a scenic and relatively easy desert hike. We didn't see any rams but it was still worth it. To avoid the heat, I began at around 4:30pm and got back at around 6:30 (fall time). It got dark fast so bring a headlamp or flashlight if you go in the late afternoon / early evening. And of course, bring at least 2 litters of water per person (the park recommends 1 gallon per person, but I don't think that's necessary unless you're going during the day on a hot day, which I wouldn't recommend anyway."", 'No water right now but super nice hike.', 'This was a great trial however at the time we hiked it there wasn’t much water. The alternate route on the way back is more up hill than the main route. But we did it because I like to do ‘ loop’ trails (it looks better on Strava.lol). Also there is a $10 fee when you enter this part of the park.', 'The trail is easy to following and just beautiful... that said, this is a HOT hike. I am a well-acclimated desert dweller and heat is not a problem for me, also I am an avid hiker. This was just over 3 miles of what I would consider an easy walk, but even I got a little over heated in this sunny canyon. I am only saying this so that people may take the warning and carry enough water... the park suggests no less than 1 gallon per person and I would certainly agree with that. With the proper supplies, this is a lovely walk with some very interesting geology! Saw a huge herd of Big Horn. Loved it.', 'Loved this trail!! Saw a bunny and some Bighorn sheep while on this trail!', 'Great hike! Rock climbing, long hike and great views. :)', 'Wonderful trail! Have seen bighorn sheep many times. Hot this time of year; drink water!Horses are not allowed.', 'The Palms at the end of the canyon are such a beautiful surprise. I recommend taking the alternate route back. It provided a bit more variety and elevation change. Plus it was less crowded. (Though no shade). Kids loved this hike.', ""We did this hike Saturday afternoon. We were lucky that the weather was beautiful - not too hot! There were six of us (3 adults, 3 kids in good shape (9-11 years old). There were areas to get a break from the sun from boulder shadows. I would not recommend if you have difficulty getting around as some areas require a little boulder scrambling. We caught two catci in bloom and a few other desert plants but not that much in bloom. The oasis was great and we stopped and had a picnic snack. Tip: park at the camper area - free with paid admission. Parking at the visitor's center will add 3 miles RT to your hike in the sun."", 'A very fun and scenic hike. The wife and kids loved it. Enjoyed climbing over rocks, crossing streams and the oasis is breathtaking. Didn’t see any sheep but we made it to end by 8am. We where the only ones on trail then but did get crowded by 9am. I can’t wait to go back and hopefully witness the big horns.', 'We did this hike years ago & loved it...went again yesterday with friends visiting from Vancouver...great hike & we were lucky to get to see some big horn sheep grazing by the streams edge. Weather was perfect! Disappointed that the Oasis pool is now barricaded off from getting in the water but still an enjoyable experience :)', 'This is a wonderful hike, especially if you are looking for that Oasis out in the desert spot to enjoy! We hiked it in February and the weather was perfect! Starts in sand, rock and cactus and ends with palms, shade and water!  We found it a very enjoyable hike!', 'Very nice hike. Not one to speed through. Take the time to just stop & view the varied scenery & vistas. Alternative trail down is rocky & has enough uphill to make it interesting.', 'Big Horn Sheep family What a treat!', 'Love this little hike, I’ve done it a few times now. This last visit the bighorn rams were literally on the trail. It was great!', 'Although this hike is short and fairly easy, the landscape is stunning. The weather was perfect this afternoon, sunny and warm with a comfortable breeze. Water was also flowing in the creek. Unfortunately, I didn’t see any sheep, but I also didn’t go in the morning. I felt a huge sense of peace on this hike and would definitely recommend it. Just don’t go at peak times! I heard this hike gets very busy. Pros: Ample parking, clean bathrooms. Cons included a $10 entry fee (seemed steep to me), and human feces toward the end of the trail. It was so gross.', 'Loved the water', ""This was an awesome hike! Not to much and a beautiful scenery! Unfortunately we didn't see any big horn, maybe next time though"", ""This was an awesome hike! Not to much and a beautiful scenery! Unfortunately we didn't see any big horn, maybe next time though"", ""This was an awesome hike! Not to much and a beautiful scenery! Unfortunately we didn't see any big horn, maybe next time though"", 'Easy hike, no difficulty whatsoever. Very tame compared to just about every other Anza trail, both in terms of difficulty and structural layout. National park quality maintenance, highly impressed, impossible to go off route. On the hike back there is an option to take an alternate route. Do not take this as it leads up the canyon, there is no scenery there. If you want to view sheep, best come early during morning hours. Good hike, strong running water and stunning visuals. The palm grove is the best Anza has to offer as far as green sanctuaries are concerned.', ""I really enjoyed this hike.  Saw four large bighorn rams munching away, and many females and juveniles up on the hill.  I think moderate is a fair description, as there are some sections you need to do a bit of climbing, but the giant palm groves are well worth it. I'll come back again."", 'Nice short hike. Beautiful oasis and lots of rocks to climb.', 'Great trail for beginners or with small kids. It’s about a 3 mile round trip with an alternate route back which is great. A bit crowded during the weekend when the weather is nice and cool.', 'It’s easy, and most of the time the goats come close to the trails. Don’t drink the water, the rangers have said that is definitely not clean!', 'Busy trail.  The palm oasis almost seems strange and is a stark contrast to the desert canyon in which it sits.  The path beyond the oasis is barricaded off within the palm grove, but there are alternative routes to continue beyond the palms.  Beyond the palms it is a scramble with no defined path to the upper pools.', 'Beautiful hike to oasis.', 'Great trail- I suggest packing a bit extra water and keep going up into the canyon- amazing pools of water and more interesting rocks', ""Nice but heavily trafficked hike. If you get lucky, you'll see the sheep (but not guaranteed). Bring plenty of water, hat, and sunscreen -- the trail is mostly exposed. I don't recommend the alternate trail. $10 to park -- and please don't complain about it. Those fees are the reason this place gets maintained and remains open to the public."", 'I had done this once before and seen not a glimpse of the famously hidden big horn sheep. But this time, with expectations low, we\'d barely left the car when, not more than 80 or so yards off the trailhead, there he was, not up in the jagged cliffs, but down below moseying around in the wash. Quite a sight given their rarity. Aside from the sheep the trail remains way up the list for iconic California Desert hikes.  The oasis is just that; an actual oasis, something one might find in a movie about an exotic locale in another part of the world. Maybe King Kong will be spotted parting some of the big palm trees to investigate our presence. Lots of rock scrambling and not for summer months.  Beware the ""alternative route""; no signage and trail can be tough to follow.', '', 'Fantastic oasis at the end', 'Beautiful oasis!', 'Great hike with oasis at the end of the trail. On the way out saw five big horn sheep on a mountainside.', ""We did this trail at the worst time of day . We started at 11 am and the heat started to get intense . My mom and my 14 y/o had to stay under a palm tree while I finished my way to the oasis . I get there and it's totally dry . We head back and we ddnt have enough water . Make sure you have enough water for this hike ."", 'Really enjoyed the walk.  Left before sunrise to avoid the heat.  We were unable though to go all the way to the oasis as we encountered LOTS of bees towards the end', 'Saw so many bighorn sheep!', ""My favorite hike in the entire county. Absolutely epic!  I've also since read you can continue on past the oasis further up the creek to 2 more oases, making it a bit longer and more interesting. Complete with some bouldering and multiple stream crossings. The extremely fit and adventurous can continue from the 3rd oasis up to the summit of Indianhead Mountain. That peak is savage though, haven't attempted it but heard some gnarly things about it."", ""Trail is relatively easy until the end where you have to scramble over rocks. Wear shoes with good traction. You also have to cross the steam a couple of times. Trail is marked well until near the end where we were left wondering where we should be. We made a few oops and had to turn back. There is zero shade or places to rest so wear a wide brimmed hat and take plenty of water. The oasis is  pretty. You go from desert and killer sun to palm trees and shade. I would go earlier in the day than we did to save yourself some of the heat. Glad I went once but not a trip I would do again. There is a $10 fee. There's a yellow ticket to put in your window. A ranger did drive through and check for them when were coming back to our car."", ""Great beautiful hike! Rocky in parts. Gorgeous palm oasis at the end! The alternate route back isn't easy to follow and isn't marked. I lost my way and had to climb through cactus and lots of rocks to get back to the main trail!"", 'Beautiful trail and great if you want to keep going up the canyon to explore more and make the hike a little longer and harder. See how many waterfalls you can find!Be sure to go as early as you can, hopefully before the sunrise to avoid the heat and the crowds!', 'We did this one 2/20/17. It was beautiful weather and not too hot. The trail is pretty easy and really no elevation gain. The waterfall at the top makes it worth the trip. Definitely want to make sure it is flowing before you make the trek. Lots of mountain goats at the bottom which was very exciting to see.', 'The trail takes you to an oasis. Bring water, sunblock & be aware of your footing.', 'Beautiful palm tree oasis. Go early to avoid the crowds.', 'Wild flowers if your timing is right', 'Great light hike.', 'Beautiful trail. Wild flowers are in bloom. Moderate trail but our kids had no trouble making it with small break.', ""The most beautiful hike I've ever been on.  Wildflowers and the oasis were incredible."", ""beautiful. waterfall and the desert bloom. can't get much better."", 'Get there early to avoid crowds...parking is not that big. Bring enough water. The trail is very well maintained, there was lots and lots of flowers. The palm oasis was really nice.', 'Excellent trail, a little crowded, but overall an excellent hike!! Easy to moderate, but arrive early (to avoid heat) and bring plenty of water.', ""I didn't like that the hike was pretty narrow in certain spots.  The alternative path wasn't as well routed as the original path.  Lots and lots of loose, small rocks.  The little pool by the cluster of palm trees was worth the hike up.Flowers were absolutely beautiful during the super-bloom.Oh, and I was scolded by the park staff to cover up my arms...because the sun burns!!!!  I left my sleeves rolled up and it all turned out fine, in case you were wondering.$10 to park..:boooooooo"", 'Amy and I loved this hike. Many wildflowers and even saw two bighorn sheep! Start early, 7 am latest as the crowds start shortly thereafter and parking is limited.', 'Great hike!!!!!', 'Wildflowers are in full bloom and absolutely beautiful!  My friend and I actually started this hike at 5pm, so 90% of the time we were shaded by the canyon.  Also, not super crowded at that time.  Highly recommend this hike.', 'best done starting at 6:30 am so you can finish it around 9 am. it starts to be very hot', 'This trail is outta sight!', ""Very crowded on the weekend for the Super bloom...and HOT.  Got there at 8:15am and still had to park 2 miles from the trail head.  Wanted to give up before I even started (this was my FIRST trail ever!)  But I managed to finish AND walk the 2 miles back to my car! So my round trip hike was almost 7 miles! lol.  It was beautiful but too many people for my taste...def go midweek and EARLY before it's too hot.  Saw a LOT of big horn sheep up close as they were crossing the trail to get to the stream.  Very cool!"", ""$10 day use fee if you park at the trail head. Very popular, well maintained trail with bathroom facilities at the trail head. Good place for viewing wildflowers and I've heard that bighorn sheep have been spotted further up in the canyon. The south side of the loop trail had a fraction of the people that the north side had the day I was there."", 'It was beautiful. Easy in my opinion even as a beginner to this hiking life but even if it were more difficult, the payoff is the gorgeous view.', ""Amazing hike.  Quick mile and a half but washed out rock makes the hike in, fun.  Easily read trail markers and landmarks guide your way back to the oasis.  This was my first experience at an oasis and it surely didn't disappoint.  Once you make it the oasis, the fun just begins.  So many waterfalls and great photo opportunities.  Peaceful.  Truly an oasis in the desert.  The trail splits off as a loop before rejoining for the final third of a mile in.  Next visit I will take the alternate route.  Can't wait to come back."", 'Great trail, easily marked and wicked view from the alternate trail on the return.  Worth a try for sure.', 'Very popular trail, came back on the other side of the spring with nice views of the valley... not easy as the other side but not so difficult', 'Really beautiful trail, especially after all this rain.  Did an attempt at Indianhead Mountain, but took the wrong ridge up like a dope and got stuck at about 3000 ft.  Had to call it for the day after that.  This trail here though is really pretty and easy to get lost on as the real trail disappears around the first palm grove.  Defintely looks like a cool backpacking trip, and I will be back for Indianhead very soon.  Trust.', ""Trail isn't very obvious and it can be easy to stray from it unintentionally. The end has rocks to climb though and the view it will provide of the oasis is beautiful. Highly recommend if you are in the area."", 'the alternative trail back was more difficult.  it was stoney and no trail markers.', ""A great trail, we took our kids and it was manageable to do with a two year old and our baby. It was warm when we went but not like it is during the summer, if you're going in the summer months obviously bring water. The trail has a perfect ending at the oasis with shade to cool off, and we had a good amount of water coming through the creek. Definitely will do it a third time."", 'We hiked this after hiking Hellhole Canyon and although this is easy, the up close opportunity to walk within feet of big horn sheep was the highlight of the hikes.', 'Did this in March 2016. Flowers all over. Saw a couple of female big horn on the slopes above.', 'Did this hike at night. It was cool!', 'Nice walk, lot of lizards and great variety of cactus.  End of the hike is awesome, the oasis is worth the hike!', 'Lovely trail. Lots of wild flowers and birds. We saw a wild borrego too!', 'Pretty easy hike, I took the main trail up and it was pretty easy. When I took the alternate trail down I got a little lost but not hard to find. Make sure to bring a lot of water and snacks to enjoy in the oasis. Went in the afternoon and has the oasis to myself.', 'Pretty easy hike. Very cool when you realize that you are approaching an actual desert oasis. Ice experience to sit in and cool down in the oasis.  Great early in the morning, can get crowded during weekend days.  Always fun (been there 6+ times)', 'Nice little scrambles. Take lots of water and go early if you want the oasis to yourself.', 'Nice and easy trek up the trail. Great to find water and the ecosystem around it. Watch the mountain goats, birds and yes, be quiet. You will enjoy more.', 'Nice, popular, and easy trail with beautiful scenery and an oasis. The water was running. Parking was $8', 'Pick a mid-winter weekday.  Take the kids and/or camera.  Be quiet.  See sheep.', 'Nice, moderate-easy trail. Went in December and the weather was perfect. ', ""Fun, moderately difficult for me because I'm overweight and out of shape but I made it to the oasis with no problems.  Take plenty of water.  I started in the parking lot of the campground, which costs $8.00 to access.  I didn't go any further than the oasis because I was by myself and having a hard time finding the trail beyond the oasis.  The trail itself was beautiful, running along a small stream.  I saw several big horn sheep up close, including young ones.  They were very playful and fun to watch.  There were a handful of people on the trail but everyone was respectful of the wildlife and others trying to enjoy the peace and quiet.  For me, it ended at the oasis.  I sat underneath the palms and had my lunch, enjoying listening to the stream in the shade.  Extremely peaceful.  I took the alternate route out."", ""To camp here is recommended, though a day trip is good if you come early. The stream feeding the oasis is seasonal, so doing the hike some time after recent rains is best if you want to enjoy the oasis. I went upstream and was cooling off under a waterfall in the afternoon and the flow was suddenly stopped, making me suspect there is a dam upstream that regulates the flow. There's a lot of birds and wildlife along the canyon especially in spring when the water is flowing."", ""Great hike.Easy and fun for all, but BRING WATER AND ESSENTIALS.  Met several unprepared people up there and one older lady that almost didn't make it back.  No phone service in case 911 is needed.Great oasis at the end with places to play in the waterfalls.  Was a great time with kids."", ""Don't stop when you get to palm oasis. Keep hiking through the canyon, following the spring upstream. The views are great and it is fun trying to find your way through the canyon. You can turn around when you please, but you will probably want to keep going to see what is around the next bend!"", 'Love this hike.  Take the alternate trail up and palm canyon to return.', ""Great mid December hike in the desert. Temperature was mid 70's. I am 4 months pregnant and this was the perfect length for me. Make sure to keep hydrating throughout the hike. The palm oasis is gorgeous. My husband and I brought a picnic and enjoyed the view up on a rock. We parked at the campsite parking lot and hiked to the oasis and back. No animal sightings however big horned sheep are around that area.. Good hike for the family. "", ""Awesome spring! Neat mini-oasis. Hike the egg it's a great view! (Just very strenuous)"", 'Awesome!  October temps make this one enjoyable.', 'Absolutely incredible hike! We went early in the morning during the week and had the whole trail to ourselves the entire day. The scenery is incredible, especially the beautiful palm oasis. I will definitely be hiking this again. Bring LOTS of water!', 'Today was sooo hot it was incredible. The hike was awesome with varied terrain and difficulty. A lot of fun. But I think we got dehydrated in spite of the fact we were drinking. Probable a better idea to do this in the winter', 'There were a lot of people. The upside is that most are really nice. The trail was well marked but at times you may stray. It was a good hike. The only downside was not the trail or the people on it. It was the people that work at the park. JUst not friendly and kinda cold. Lots of horned sheep....borrego.', 'Very touristy, but for a very good reason...it is beautiful, accessible and fun.  Saw lots of isolated flowers and cacti blooming.  Nearby Nature Center is marvelous with a comprehensive garden.', 'Nice short and popular trail. There are better trails in the area, but this is the classic. Bring a picnic lunch to eat under the trees. Ps bring lots of water. ', 'Very popular trail, great scenery. Look for Borregos; they can be seen along the side of the mountain faces at times, but blend in very well. A few too many people at times, no great overlooks as compared to some of the mountaintop trails.', ""Bring plenty of water and start early! We would have lingered longer at the beautiful oasis, but didn't want to hike back after 12pm. The ambient temperature at the oasis drops at least 20 degrees, very nice! Wear sturdy shoes. Went on a weekday, popular spot because it is near the camp ground. Nice day hike."", ""On advice from a Park Ranger I drove into the camp ground and started the hike from there.  There is an $8 entrance fee, but takes a lot of distance off the trail.  From here it's only 1.5 miles to the oasis."", 'Will make this an annual hike - good possibility of seeing some of the elusive desert bighorn. Make the drive into Borrego Springs to the Anza Borrego visitor center. One of the nicer visitor centers staffed by some of the nicest folks.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '',

This trail is not hard and the view at the top is very nice. Would definitely do it again.', 'Pretty easy, short hike if you’re only going to the rock itself. It’s a really dusty trail with a lot of horse poop, but I wasn’t surprised since it’s so heavily traveled by horses. When we went, there was actually an event going on at the equestrian center below, so we took our dog over to watch after the hike. The people were very nice and courteous to us.', 'Took a different way this time and went a little further then the pumpkin. I love this hike now. Not too easy but not too difficult.', 'For anyone new to this trail you can park at Pikes peak park and walk to the trail. It’s nice a great begging trail for people like me who are working their way back up to hiking.', 'This was great as there are two ways to go up/down. Cool graffiti to take photos by and a nice  breeze at the top (end of November). Be careful as there is a lot of broken glass at the top however.

I had heard about Pumpkin Rock through a friend and decided to come out from LA to check it out.  Seeing pumpkin rock surpassed all my expectations.  There are quite a number of ways to hike up to Pumpkin Rock, although I chose to take the route where Apple Maps indicates the start of the trail.  The trail starts alongside a golf course and goes up the ridge of a fairly barren hill with chaparral.  Once at the top of the hill, continue hiking over a somewhat flat slight decline from hill top to hilltop until you run into Pumpkin Rock.  You really can’t miss it, it’s bright orange.  There’s a bunch of cool graffiti and smaller “pumpkin rocks nearby, so there’s a lot to see.  Some of the graffiti is better than others, although there are some very artsy pieces.  The views from Pumpkin Rock are spectacular.  You can see over the town of Norco, and on the other side you can see one of the valleys just south of Riverside.  I highly recommend this hike, especially this time of year.  Get festive and go hike this one for Halloween.\n\nHope you enjoy!\n\nPlaylist for the trail: https://spoti.fi/2AqxCAx', 'Pretty cool seeing Pumpkin Rock up close.', 'Sooo fun!! Easy and awesome sunset with the photo op!!', 'enjoyed the hike went on the windiest day ever but it was well worth it.', 'The hike was very clean, there were many trails available.

Will go back again!', 'There were some steep bits that had some tricky footing, but the view was great.

I was excited to see the pumpkin rock but it was so covered in graffiti I couldn't take a decent picture. I walked it with my 18 month old on my back. Definitely a good workout for me but not much for my daughter to enjoy.

We parked in the equestrian center lot (Ingalls Park) and made our way up from there.  We huffed and puffed a bit at the beginning and end, but everyone, dogs and kids included, made it to the top.

We took our time, enjoyed the walk and times spent together. I’d definitely spray my kids with bug spray or something before going next time but other than that it was fun.

Also be sure u have plenty of water.', 'Easy trail my kids love it', 'I think it would be more fun to go the month of October. You get some pretty good views in all directions from the top of the hill and a good photo op with the the ""pumpkin head"". It was a short hike of about 2.5 miles and there is no shade.

When you get to the Trail head walk the trail that's to the left along the Fence. That is a quick quarter of a mile or so to get to the horses..... then so visit the Pumpkin.Enjoy.

Make sure youre wearing closed toed shoes and keep an eye on kids, lots of broken glass around. Graffiti is fun to see but not exactly PG-13. Wouldn't want to be there after dark!

For the 1mi route, I would have classified it a moderate difficulty, but since it was short.. I suppose I can understand why people would say it easy.

I know this boulder is painted but this hike is famous specifically for that boulder. Despite the graffiti, it's a great trail for a short family hike. Just watch your step as it can be very steep. I'll definitely go again since my daughter loved it"", 'This was fun hike. We had our 1 year old and dog. The trail is not stroller friendly but our daughter walked some of the way and we took turns carrying her the parts that were too hard for her. Like ya of hills. Definitely a hike to do on a cooler day or first thing in the morning. The pumpkin rock was fun to see but there is a lot of graffiti on the other big rocks. And someone thought it would be funny to paint a penis near the mouth of the pumpkin. But you can easily stand in front of it to cover it up in pictures.', ""Not jogging stroller friendly.

It would have been a 5 star if it wasn't for all the tagging...."", ""Fun little trail with good views from the top and the pumpkin is definitely a unique feature. My kids loved seeing the pumpkin. The area around the pumpkin rock is incredibly littered with large and small shards of broken glass however. Disappointing!

I had hiked pass the pumpkin and on the way back it was a little slippery with the sand and how steep it was. But overall the hike was good and my man's dog enjoyed it as well. Obviously bring a flashlight and a walking stick of some kind to help with walking down the sandy trail, when hiking at night."", 'I rated this trail 4 stars because it is difficult to follow and find the loop.

The best times I found to go hiking are either early in the morning when the sky is clear and air is cool or when it is around 3-6 in the afternoon. Even if it is 90 degrees out, there is usually a good wind blowing which controls sweating and is actually nice at the top. It is much easier to start the hike by the golf course rather than starting at the Rodeo Areas because you will have more down hill hiking this direction. If you want a good work out, start from the Arenas.', ""I've always wanted to hike to this pumpkin since the day my aunt moved to norco! It is visible from the 15 fwy and always caught my attention, so one day I set my mind to it and went! I went up with my cousin and their German Shepard. It was in the mid 90's that day so it was pretty hot! we hiked up pretty fast and had a great view from the top.

(Date hiked: March 19, 2011.) Read the full write-up at: http://www.greeneadventures.com/2011/04/04/carbon-canyon-regional-park-is-lush-and-green-this-spring/', 'Redwood trees in Southern California?\xa0 I had heard that there was a grove of Sequoia sempervirens somewhere in Orange County, but had never been able to figure out where.\n\nAs it turns out, the trees are located near Brea, California off State Route 142 near Carbon Canyon Dam inside Carbon Canyon Regional Park.\xa0 The park itself offers visitors activities including fishing, hiking, volleyball, picnic areas, tennis, ball fields, and playgrounds in a idyllic setting, and virtually every review is positive.\xa0 From my hike through the park, to get to the trailhead, I could see it was well-maintained, had plenty of grass areas and shade trees, and is certainly worth a visit.\xa0 It\'s a very family-friendly park. Parking costs weekdays is $3, and I believe I read that it\'s $5 on weekends, or you can save the entry fee and park on residential streets nearby.\n￼\n\nWhat I was there for was a leisurely day hike to see some big trees, so I headed over to the trailhead.\n\nCarbon Canyon Regional Park Nature Trail offers a 3.4 mile or shorter 2.2 mile multi-use loop trail to park visitors. The trail is easy, good for all skill levels, and is primarily used for hiking. Hikers, mountain bikers and horses all use the trail. Dogs are welcome as well, but must be kept on a leash.\n\nI was there early on a Wednesday morning in August.\xa0 Not a whole lot of traffic, and not a whole lot of cloud cover, either.\xa0 The day was supposed to be around 80 degrees, and even this early it felt like it was going to no problem pushing the mercury up that high.\n\nI parked near the volleyball courts so I could walk through the whole park first.\xa0 I walked around the lake and over to the northeast corner of the park near the native garden and amphitheater and began the hike.\n\nThe regional park is made up of 124 acres, of which about sixty are developed.\xa0 The trail follows the boundaries of the park, crossing over a stream bed, and heads off through the undeveloped area.\xa0 Meandering in a southwesterly direction, hikers should follow the occasional bright green signs emblazoned with the word ""Redwoods"" and which sport an arrow pointing in the direction you should go if you want to find the trees.\n\nThe trail is wide and mostly level and unpaved to the redwood grove, with a total elevation change of about 90\'.\xa0 As a shared use trail that includes horses, it\'s recommended that you watch where you\'re walking. \xa0I\'m just sayin\'...\n\nIn August, there is a lot of dry brush.\xa0 Not much moves around except for unseen squirrels, an occasional butterfly, and a few birds.\xa0 The air is clean and fresh.\xa0 Since there isn\'t any real cover along the trail, make sure you bring a hat, sunscreen, water, and comfortable shoes.\n\nWhen the Carbon Canyon Dam comes into view, the trail turns eastward.\xa0 Within a few minutes you arrive at the redwood grove.\n\nAccording to the park\'s Nature Center, in 1975 coastal redwood seedlings were part of a giveaway by a local bank.\xa0 The story goes that after the giveaway was over, the bank still had 600 tiny trees left.\xa0 The bank donated them to Fullerton College where they lived for awhile in the agricultural center before the the college donated them to the county.\xa0 The trees were planted, and the redwood grove began to flourish.\xa0 Since they were planted, many of the trees have grown to over 100 feet.\xa0 While that\'s certainly impressive, these trees can live more than 1,200 years and grow to almost 400 feet!\xa0 Because of how tightly planted together these trees are, though, it\'s unlikely that they\'ll grow that high, or reach their full potential of a 26\' diameter trunk.\n\nThe sequoia is native to California, growing along much of the central and northern California coast.\xa0 The tree isn\'t a Southern California local, however; there isn\'t sufficient rainfall for these thirsty giants. \xa0When you first reach the redwood grove, you\'ll immediately notice a change in the air; it\'s moist.\xa0 Under the canopy of these toddlers, the ground isn\'t dry.\xa0 In fact, you might want to watch out for mud as you wander among the giants.\xa0 Once you step inside the grove, the air is 10 degrees cooler. \xa0The redwood grove is a completely different ecosystem than what surrounds it.\n\nTake the time to smell the air.\xa0 Lay on your back (in a relatively dry spot!) and look up at 38 years worth of history.\xa0 This view is what makes the hike worth every step.\n\nThere is one bench and a drinking fountain in the grove.\xa0 During my entire visit, I was the only human.\n\nYou have a couple of options for the return hike.\xa0 If you want to get the full loop experience, you can cross over to the south side of the grove, where there\'s a concrete sidewalk, and you can continue over to the Carbon Canyon Dam, and the back around the northeast edge of the park, or you can head back the way you came, and after about a mile there\'s a trail that branches off across the dry stream bed and back into the manicured area of the park near the volleyball courts.', 'I love coming to Carbon Canyon, the hike up the steep hill is pretty tiresome and dangerous near the top as the trail has partially disintegrated over time.

affordable way to enjoy Muir Woods is: 1. Take bus(#30)/ferry to Sausalito ($6.50/$12 one way), 2. Take Muir Woods shuttle ($3 round trip; reserve seat in advance). Beats the $70+ tours! This trail was mainly in the shade but got some filtered sun. Very few muddy spots. Well maintained, wide packed trail for most of it. There is no summit (it hugs the contour line once you’ve reached max elevation) and there aren’t viewpoints. Consider the Dipsea trail if you want a peak at the ocean. Definitely nice to get away from the crowds.', 'Enjoy this hike and the beautiful views. It was hard for me because of all the stairs and steps this hike had but overall it was beautiful!', '', 'Really great hike! One of the best around. Only saw a few people on the trail and there is plenty of shade! We went in the morning and it was the perfect time. Saw some deer and a banana slug (watch out for them crossing the trail!) Most tourists do not usually hike and just check out the visitor center and around it. I recommend reserving parking in advance online, which is really all you have to worry about when going to Muir Woods.', 'I hiked this trail for the first time in January and was so inspired by the beauty, I hiked the loop a second time.  Definitely tired after 2 loops, but followed it by a great meal at BooKoo in Mill Valley. I’ve returned three times since because the trail views are lovely.  In the summer, the amphitheater is used for live theater so we planned a day around it: We watched Mama Mia and then hiked...very fun. I felt safe hiking it alone, but use your own discretion.', 'One of my favorite hikes in mount tam. Perfect level of difficulty with some steep climbs, gorgeous views, and it’s a loop trail.', 'Had a great time on this trail. It was our second time hiking and it was definitely a challenge but 100% worth it for the beauty.', 'We started off this trail towards Mt. Tam East Peak last Sunday. Great Hike despite the struggle, the steep stairs & rocky areas. It sure did kicked our butts but it’s all worth it once you get to the peak with the panoramic view of the city and the view above the clouds! It’s just so magical! Im definitely coming back!', 'Gorgeous! Can be pretty steep in some parts, but not too bad.', 'Nice hike and great payoff if you go slightly off trail on the Dipsea to see the views of the ocean.', 'Decent trail. Would rate easy to moderate. Great views.', 'Great hike with a bit of a climb opening up to a beautiful view of the Bay Area.', 'Amazing foliage', 'nice chill beautiful hike', ""So we did this trail backwards which I think I preferred since I hate walking downhill. For all the downhill part of the hike we went uphill which seemed hard to some of my hiking companions. Very nice views and not a lot of hikers on the trail. Couldn't record the entire route; the app was killing my phone while tracking and battery was draining fast."", 'Loved the trail but there are a TON of stairs. I don’t know that I would call this moderate.. I brought friends and after the first mile up the steep stairs we all wanted to turn back. I wish I knew how to do this hike backwards..', 'Awesome trail! We started from Bootjack Campground and hiked TCC trail to Cardiac Hill. Amazing views from there!', 'Great trail. Lots of trees to get cover from the sun. Lots of stairs to climb.Tall trees and a creek along the way', 'Not really a heavy trafficed trail. Plenty of shade, lots of great vista points to see.', 'Pretty good trail, for first half of the trail there’s a beautiful stream on your left clear and clean water! The canopies on these trails and big trunk trees give you the feeling of Lilliputians in the land of giants :) Not too many people, so if you want to do this solo ... you have complete privacy! But if you want to go with friends, absolutely fun uninhibited. Absolutely loved the weather on feb 3rd, moderate and the sun was out. Couldn’t record the complete trail due to phone issues, but the round trip would take you about 3-4 hours with short 10min breaks every hour.', 'Love this hike! You’ll have beautiful views of the creek as you go alongside it for almost half the hike. Lots of great stopping points along the way if you wanna take a break for a lunch in the woods!

Lo recomiendo.', 'Beautiful! ❤️', 'muy útil, y gran ayuda. gracias.', 'great', 'Beautiful trail among the Redwood trees. One of the best hikes. Steep up on Bootjack trail, but worth every step.

Completed in 2.5 hours. Lots of shade, forest to look at.', 'Beautiful trees with easy to moderate inclines.  Get there early to avoid throngs of people.  I went there on free admission day, and it was still very enjoyable.  Will be going back to try out other trails.', 'Really nice trail. A number of hills and slopes but easy to navigate.Recommended!', 'Beautiful trail. Very easy to follow and navigate. Steep moderate is accurate as it is steep in some places. Seems to be either uphill or down throughout but plenty of gradual elevation gain, just not much flat terrain. I cannot express how beautiful it is in John Muir Woods. Enjoy!', ""Really nice short hike, so nice to be amoungst the redwoods and lots of streams, pools to pause at. Went on a week day so wasn't too busy at the bottom at all and only saw one person on the upper trails with me. Steep up Bootjack, so a nice workout, the rest is gentle. Really great as the leaves are turning. Easy to make longer and break the tree line at the top."", '', 'The forest was very nice, the redwoods are really impressive. Highly recommended.

Hiked up Bootjack and then down Troup 80 / Sierra / etc.  This worked out well for us because my wife trail ran down;  this would have been extremely difficult coming down Bootjack.  Nice views along the ridgeline at the top.  Very quiet once you get off the boardwalk.  Saw maybe 20 or so people.', ""It's a pretty loop.

Second half of me is all incline!!!\nMe: Oh the humanity!!!\n\nBeautiful trail with a lot of waterfalls and redwoods. You will burn up alot of calories with this hike. Also keep it secret, don\'t push the common tourist to see this. Anyway, at the top of the trail is a meadow so make sure to play some Rocky music and do what he did at the Rocky steps in Philadelphia. You will be exhausted but proud when you get here. \n\nHead right to what looks like an incline with stone made steps, that is Troop 80 trail (enjoy the beautiful and extremely quiet at times woods and views). It will take you to the easy and do-able downhill Sierra Trail.

Knowing the area a little better, I connected with Bootjack hiking from Muir Woods & it was awesome! Nice stream & good dose of stairs.', ""Not sure I stayed on Bootjack trail because it didn't seem like a 6 mile loop. Ended up branching off a side trail down to Stinson Beach that was a little over 4 miles. All downhill so it was pretty easy. Rainy weather forced me to walk a slower pace but it was nice. Saw a few wild turkeys, banana slugs, & various birds."", 'Serenity', ""Bootjack Trail is very nice and peaceful, but start early, and know it's going to be a bit of a climb. Flows a creek most of the way. Hiking sticks will be your friend on this trail for the incline and many thick stairs. Go early to avoid crowds.

Being from Southern California, this was my first hike amongst the unparalleled beauty that is Northern California.Parked and started at theBootjack Trailhead. Parking is 8 dollars but nobody was around and all I had was 2 bucks. I\'ll pay you back someday, CA State Parks, I promise. Be prepared to walk almost entirely downhill until you meet up with the Muir Woods trailhead and it\'s tourists. I decided to avoid them and turned around and hiked up to Alice Eastwood campground, where I connected with the Sierra trail, the Troop 80 trail, and then eventually back with the Bootjack trail and parking lot. Altogether the hike was about 5 miles give or take. Bring water (2-3 16oz bottles should suffice) and some protein/food as the hike took about 4 hours.One piece of advice: if you\'re not in shape as much as you\'d like to be, maybe consider a different trail as I\'m pretty sure I saw ""the light"" a couple of times.', 'Excellent at dusk.', 'I did the Muir Woods -Bootjack-TCC-Dipsea Loop and had a blast. This was a moderate trail. I started in the Muir Woods National Monument. I had to park down on the side of the road because I got a late start in the day, about noon.  The section of trails in Muir woods proper are mostly boardwalk and have bathrooms at the start. There is a small fee to get into the park as well. At the end of the boardwalk I was able to continue onto the Bootjack trail, then took the TCC trail to the Dipsea trail and then all the way back to the Muir Woods park entrance. Somewhere around Bootjack you end up in Mt Tamalpais State Park. This part of the trail gets nice and quite and is a great forest stroll. Parts of the trails have steep inclines with some stairs to help out. Also there is some wildlife as I came around a corner and ran into two groups of Turkeys. The male was not please with my presence and puffed up and growled at me until I passed. Most of the trails also run along side a creek which had about 100 small waterfalls and crystal clear water. Parts of the Dipsea trail opened up to a meadow and some decent views of the coast. I would recommend sunblock and a hat for that section of trails. I ended up doing 6.5 miles in about 4 hours and barely saw any other people. I happened to also go late on a Friday. \nI love the variety of trails that run through Muir Woods and Mt. Tamalpais and next time I want to try the coastal trail or the ocean view trail to get a better view of the coast.', 'Not a very difficult trail. The view from the atrium is awesome.', 'Great trail!! Love to get away from SF', ""We went up to Mt Tam to do the Dipsea trail but it was packed- some event going on.  So instead we chose to go down Bootjack.  It was lovely.  The kids had a blast.  We took our time going down just so we could take it all in, the hike itself was fairly easy going down.  There was one spot of the trail that was quite iffy, it must have been rained out, but other than that one spot it was very well maintained.  We went back up the Stapleveldt Trail.  That was pretty killer, we were all worn out by the time we got back to the top, the kids refused to walk anymore once we got to the Dipsea Station and my husband had to hike the last 1/2 mile to get the car from the Bootjack parking lot.  As hard as coming back up was it was still very nice, although I think we didn't get to enjoy it quite as much as the trip down.  :)  "", ""Here's a good day's worth of trails.  Start at Muir Woods.  Take the Hillside Trail (starts at the end of the second bridge)and go left at the Ben Johnson trail.  Continue straight at the Stapleveldt trail to Pantoll Ranger Station.  Cross the road and bear right to the Old Mine Trail.  Follow up and over the hills to the Rock Springs parking lot and take the Cateract trail to the Helen Markt trail.  Lunch at Alpine lake.  Head back via the Kent trail and join the Benstein trail just beyond the Protrero Camp. Return to the Pantoll Ranger Station and back track to Muir Woods  This hike should be about 16 miles.  There are numerous other trails you can take to return to Muir Woods if you want to lengthen your hike.  All are solid options."", ""I love the part of this trail that loops down to Muir Woods from Alpine Trail.\nYou'll need to park at the Bootjack picnic area or you can park for free just up the road and cross the street to the barely visit trail head.\nThe best part of this trail is the gorgeous scenery.  It's almost as if you are on a trail in Hawaii. At the end of the trail, before it turns to Bootjack Spur, at the right time of year you can see the clouds of lady bugs flying in the air as they come to settle in the cool mist of the valley floor for the months to come.  \nTake Bootjack Spur up to Alice Eastwood campground/trail.  A nice rest stop if you want to have a picnic lunch.  Once there you can take the High Sierra trail and all it's switch backs to Troop 80 and eventually back to Bootjack. \nIt's a great hike and wonderful exercise.

My best backpacking experience so far.\nWe didn't resupply during our trip and it made the first few days extremely difficult, until our packs got a bit lighter - think about it twice before you commit to the fully autonomous mode! Also make sure you have a plan B in case your water filter breaks on day 2... but we were lucky and none of us got sick even after drinking unfiltered water from rivers and lakes for two weeks."", ""Check out our trip video at Trail Perspective on YouTube:\nhttps://youtu.be/EyCEu-icxrw \n& https://youtu.be/GLPpZOIsYAg\n\nDid a section of the JMT from Happy Isles to Rush Creek (Near Reds Meadow) in September.  Crazy gorgeous section of the trail, wish we could've had the time to go all the way to Whitney.  My favorite part of this section was the last part of Donahue Pass to Thousand Island Lake."", ""I did this trail in August with my best friend and it was awesome! It was hard of course, but the weather was almost perfect the whole time. There were a couple rain/hail storms but that was about it. Mosquitos only bothered us a few times, and it wasn't that bad. We did 21 days with three resupplies at Red's Meadow, Muir Trail Ranch, and Independence. Muir Trail Ranch was a disappointment with no services other than picking up our buckets, and we realized later that we should have done Vermillion Valley instead as many hikers said they had an awesome experience."", 'I hiked the JMT solo starting from Yose Valley in 2015, but got off the trail in mile 180 (Kearsarge Pass Jct) because of ankle and knee injuries. In 2015, I resupplied twice: Reds Meadow and Muir Trail Ranch (estimated 9 days of food until Whitney Portal). I finished the last 31 miles in 2016 starting from Cottonwood Lakes to Kearsarge Pass (it’s about 72 miles including Mt. Whitney, Lake Charlotte, and Kearsarge Pass Trail). I didn’t resupply for this 7 day hike. Final thoughts about the JMT: challenging, nonetheless it was an amazing experience. Easier to get a permit going NOBO than. SOBO. Trail is easy to navigate in low snow year, plenty of water sources on the trail, mozzies are relentless in July, beautiful views, mountains and lakes for days, and great people on the trail. Transportation set up: I left my car in Lone Pine  and hitched a ride to Yose for my 2015 hike and to Horseshoe Meadows trailhead in 2016. Getting back to my car from Kearsarge Pass, I hired a shuttle service to take me back to Lone Pine. Reasonable rate.', 'amazing. not to be missed.', ""This is a fantastic trail that should be considered by all that love the high sierra.   I did this in July 2015 over 15 days starting south of Whitney and ending in happy isles.  Days where long but not outragous.  I was on my own but never felt lonely.  Lots of people on the trail to talk to if you want.  You can also just hie along and people will leave you alone.  Finding a camp site or water wasn't hard.  I tried to finish my day making it halfway up a pass.  This way I could rest the night and make it over the pass for breakfast the next day.  Be sure to pack lite, I mean really only bring what you need as that pack certainly gets heavy after 15 days on the trail."", 'Not a very hard trail for downhill but it offers a great view of the Nevada fall and the valley. It also has a small cascade which you will walk under that brings you a great experience for the summer.', 'This is my favorite trail so far! I hiked it 5 times alone. I liked it so much that I even hiked it twice in one month (2009). Then I went back to hike it in 2011, 2012 and 2014. It’s time to do it again! I always hiked it in 9 - 12 days. I would like to spend more time on it, like 2 weeks to relax also.', 'hiked this in 2012...it was meant to be a thru hike but partner got sick so we had to leave right about the half way point. I went back 2 years later and finished it. One of the crown jewels in US places to backpack.', ""This is the single most impactful trail I've ever experienced. The JMT, when done it its 211 mile entirety, will yield lifelong cherished memories. Its not easy, and you must do months of preparation. Its beauty is absolutely breathtaking. I cannot recommend this trail highly enough. Six stars."", 'I am not a poet. Words cannot describe how humbling gods work is. Over every peak, the trail gets more beautiful.', 'Did this hike in 5th grade and planning on doing it again this year! It was an amazing experience and such great scenery. But extremely difficult and can be tough to follow if you do not have an experienced hiker with you.', 'One of the most beautiful sections of the PCT', 'check out two applications: Guthook JMT for $9.99 and Hikerbot for crowd source information. Both have better and more detailed info than Alltrails.', 'most wonderful, difficult, beautiful, amazing trail ever!  Go NOBO from Whitney.', 'Did the whole length SB July 2016.

AllTrails lists the Yosemite portion dog-legal, as per written description and according to map; Snow Creek trail, as well. Having a dog on-trail could result in a fine and possibly being escorted out of the park.\n\n""The National Parks (both Yosemite and Sequoia / King\'s Canyon) do not allow dogs on any parts of the trails. The only sections that would allow a dog are those in the National Forests. John Muir Wilderness in Sierra National Forest and the Ansel Adams Wilderness in Inyo National Forest. Therefore, you\'d have the trailheads from Muir Trail Ranch to Gem Lake (just short of Donahue) to hike with a dog (about 90 miles or so).""', 'Life-changing trip! I completed the trail SOBO from Tuolumne Meadows to Whitney portal and from July 16th to the 31st. This year was a heavy snowfall year which made for some snowy passes and high/fast flowing rivers and creeks, but it also made for an exceptionally beautiful trail! Saw the most beautiful views, met the best people, and had one of the most memorable experiences of my life. Make time to do this at some point in your life, would recommend to anyone!', 'Absolutely life changing!', 'My wife and I hiked the JMT NOBO via Whitney Portal to Happy Isles in Yosemite, with a resupply over Kearsarge Pass to Onion Valley. With the resupply our total mileage was 238 miles.Beautiful weather the entire 21 days', 'Joined up with this trail on my way back down from Nevada Falls and it has some really great views.  I recommend taking Mist Trail up and this one back down to the Valley. I was glad I did it that way because I got some amazing photos on this hike.', 'I love that trail.

After you do your homework and preparation."", 'Incredible views.', 'Amazing trail.', 'John Muir Trail from Devils Postpile to Happy Isles in Yosemite Valley\nAugust 3 – 12, 2015\n\nMonday 3rd:  We drove all day through the barren wasteland of Nevada.  The trip was made enjoyable by listening to Julia Sweeney’s standup, “Letting Go of God.”  Hilarious!\nWhen we arrived in Mammoth, we went on the Reds Meadow Shuttle down to Devils Postpile.  The Postpile was formed less than 100,000 years ago when a cooling lava flow cracked into multi-sided columns.  The basalt was exposed and smoothed by glaciers. \nOur first night we slept at the Whispering Pines at June Lake.  The outside view from the hotel was beautiful.\n\nTuesday 4th:  Today was dedicated to Yosemite.  We started with breakfast at Nicely’s restaurant in Lee Vining, California.  Then we went to Tuolumne Meadows to drop off our food cache in the bear boxes.  Next, we headed down to Yosemite Valley.  That place was crazy!  It was packed with people, most of them speaking different languages (e.g. the tower of Babel).  People clearly come from all over the world to enjoy this place.  \nWe took a hike in Tuolumne Grove to see the giant redwood trees.  I had never seen redwoods before and they are truly magnificent, ancient, and massive.\nYosemite is filled with granitic plutons, cooled, hardened and then uplifted and exposed by erosion.  There are mountains of white-gray granite everywhere.  One such rock is called El Capitan.  I think Brennon and Devon should climb it.  \nWhile we were standing there admiring the “big rock”, a mama doe and her two baby fawns walked out of the bushes right in front of us.  They wandered around for a minute and then happily hopped back into the forest.\nYosemite Falls is the highest waterfall in the United States.  Although it was a little anemic (not much water) its sheer height was impressive.\nWe left the truck and trailer in the Yosemite Valley and decided to take the car.  The only problem was that the car was on the tow dolly and it was completely dead.  Luckily some good Samaritans helped us shove the Mazda off the dolly and we jumped it with Uncle Steve’s truck.  We had gas station burritos for lunch.\nAt the end of the day we stopped at Tuolumne Meadows to scope out the backpacker’s camping spots and find the trailhead.  Mission accomplished except one tiny problem.  We’d walked around so long we forgot where we parked the car.  After much walking and searching we eventually found the car (in 15 min parking) and headed back to Nicely’s for dinner, and Motel 6 for one last night in a bed.\nDay 1:  We left Devils Postpile early Wednesday morning.  For lunch we stopped at one of the small Trinity lakes along the trail.  Each time we stopped to eat we also had to pump water for our bottles.  Lunch consisted of granola bars, trail mix, beef jerky, and craisins.  After a little more hiking we came upon Gladys Lake, which I thought was even grander than the little Trinity lake. \nAlong the trail we met some interesting people.  Today was the first time we met our friends from Canada, two men from British Colombia (although the older gentleman spoke French?).  They shared our lunch spot, and they were headed the same way we were; we would see them again before our hike was finished.  We also met a nice couple from Israel heading south.  The third pair of fellow hikers I will call the Swiss Miss Twins (although they really came from New Hampshire).  They were both blond with two braids in their hair.  They were clearly experienced hikers even mentioning a hike they did in South America, but today one of them had blisters.  They were heading to Red’s Meadow to take a day or two off and see if they could rest the feet and continue on.  We hiked 7.5 miles today, climbing 2000 feet, and Rosalie Lake was our first campsite.  It was by far the most beautiful of the lakes I had seen that day.  \n\nDay 2:  Breakfast is a Steve’s Special – a mixture of several different kinds of cereal and a yummy rehydrated milk powder (I promise it tastes better than I make it sound).  We left Rosalie Lake heading north on the trail.  We walked past a zillion switchbacks to get to Shadow Lake.  Next, we hiked along Shadow Creek, over a log bridge and past some amazing little waterfalls.  To simplify the hike experience I will describe it like this: up, up, up, up, then down, down, down, down (repeat).  We strolled past Garnet Lake, Ruby Lake, and Emerald Lake before arriving at 1,000 Island Lake aptly named because it is filled with small little islands.  We were supposed to camp at 1,000 Island Lake, but decided to press on another 1.5 miles to Island Pass.  We were tired when we arrived and it was a little cold, so we made camp, pumped water, and had a delicious Chili Mac for dinner.\nOur notable fellow hikers today were two ladies from Germany, one from Berlin and the other from Munich.  We also saw our first trailrunner.  She cruised by us just fast enough for me to ask if she wanted applause – she said yes. \uf04a\n\nDay 3:  As we ', 'I hiked the JMT in August of 2016.  However, due to the permit I was able to secure, I hiked the trail northbound from the Cottonwood Pass area.  This is the backpacking trip of a lifetime.  If there is a trail that deserves 5/5 stars, this is the one.\n\nI created a video series about my experience on the JMT.  You can view the videos on my Youtube channel.  Day one of my hike can be found at the link below.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/fwWzPV0Xg0M', ""It's the hike if a lifetime. Lyle Canyon is gorgeous. Donahue Pass .... AMAZING!!! If you want permits just go 2-3 days early and try to get a first come first serve. That's what we did. Happy Isles to Whitney. DO NOT USE MTR IF YOU DONT NEED TO. They are horrible to hikers. Go to VVR. They charge you less for resupply and test you like family. MTR SUCKS!!!!"", 'Once in a life time kind of trail, make sure you do your research before you go.', 'Awesome.', 'Amazing', 'Great hike! Took three of my girls (ages 12, 14, 18).

I am heading back this summer to complete the entire trail. I look forward to setting foot upon the JMT again."", ""Spent 12 days on the JMT with 2 friends. it was an amazing adventure & I can't wait to finish.

They're mostly fire trails so they're wide and clean. Some snake action can happen all year long, but...

There's trails for every fitness level, which is great. You can also bike on the main road and the easier trails. The scenery is all mountain, but cool. I have seen coyotes as well, by the dam. Snakes are pretty common during the summer, so I then try to stick to the road. Most of my encounters were with the red snakes on the visitor's center loop, and one black snake on the bmx trail right off of the loop. They are both poisonous! There's also a much skinnier snake which is not poisonous, though I forget the name of it.There's parking at the beginning of both entrances, and at the visitor's center and a tiny lot at the dam. You can also park at certain spots on the main road.2 days a month, they have free live music playing, usually native flutes or clarinets. Look on the calendar posted throughout the park.There are lots of birdies and bunnies and lizards (usually tiny). Lots of humming birds. I've had one hover right next to me for a few seconds, beautiful! :)Cons: It DOES get very hot in the summer, DO try to make it early morning or evening. There is one porta potty on the road, and one at the dam. The bathroom at the visitor's center has soap and water, make sure to go before you head out on a hiking trail. Do NOT leave your car parked inside the gates after closing! They WILL lock you in! We thought we were safe parking at the dam, but there's a gate after that! Also, the flies are a real nuisance!! You might want to wear some kind of bug repellent. I have found, though, that there are less very early in the morning or when it's super windy. I also hate that there are signs with misleading info, or no signs at all that point you in a clear direction. They REALLY need to work on that! And in some spots, the weeds or trees will overtake the path and they won't clear it, and there's ticks in there, so this just makes me angry. They need to hire me to make this park better! >:)"", 'Like others state, lots of options... But also stated in other reviews, trails were not marked and or clear. I felt lost all day. I wasnt sure if a trail was going to be two miles or ten. I started off the wrong way and when the trail ended i turned back. That was a mile and a half mistake. Plus i crossed a small creak and got my shoes and socks wet right off the bat. This all put be in a bad mood. Soon after i asked someone else for directions and they pointed me in the right direction. I did enjoy the stairs.

Bunnies, birds deer and snakes are all denizens of this area. Father Serra  walked this path. Plenty of time for quiet contemplation.  You will run into a handful of hikers and runners. There is a nice fusion of  flat land, low hills, and large Mts. You have options of paths to go on. If you have an hour there is at least one path for you.', ""Another heavily traveled trail, it does have a very pretty creek that runs through the canyon.

You can park at the Visitor Center or at the Mission Dan entrance. There is parking available in each area. I have been utilizing the Visitor Center entrance as of late. The trail is scenic with oak and maple trees , a beautiful stream  to cross over. An uphill climb awaits you after all this. This climb will take you into the heart of Misssion Trails. From here Fortuna W. mesa. will be on your left. Another hill will take you to it's mesa. Crossing the mesa to the end will take you over to No. Fortuna. There are signs that will help with directions. No. Fortuna Mt.  has a uphill rocky path with railroad ties  giving you foot security up some of it. From the top of this Mt. you then can travel down the other side and up and across to So. Fortuna Mt. At the end of So. Fortuna you will need to go down into Sucott wash. I have seen Mule deer along this trail. Snakes are in this park, but , just keep your eyes and ears open. They are far and few in between. Don't poke them. In the wash is a lovely little picnic area. After a snack/rest there, you start your way  back up  towards the Visitor Center. Mission Trails is a sensitive habitate area, so there are many areas that are corded off. This does not distract, and actually enhances a hikers journey . I went at a slow to moderate pace. I ate lunch at the top of No. Fortuna. The views from  atop the Mts. are spectacular. I took about 4 hours, going at a slow to moderate pace including lunch. I do this trail often"", 'This trail can wear you out!!! The service roads are steep and mildly dangerous.

It can get really hot during the summer, bring lots of water, sunscreen and a hat. We've also hiked during the winter, wear layers and good shoes, it can get icy on the ground. There's a covered picnic area that's perfect for lunch or a snack. It's fun to see the animals at the farm and see what's growing in the garden. The loop is fairly flat and is good for walking and running. Again there are adjoining trails to make your walk/jog longer. Rancho San Antonio Park is very popular, even though there is a lot of parking it fills up fast. Get there early or you might have to circle around waiting for someone to leave. There are bathrooms near the parking lots, I think there's outhouses near the farm. If your just doing the loop you might not need to wear hardcore hiking gear/shoes.

It's a great hike with beautiful views and just the right amount of hills to be a workout. I prefer the Creekside Trail route at the beginning and end though.The only downsides are:\n1) The treeless section as you climb the hill can be deathly hot in summer. \n2) This same section can be deeply muddy and rutted from bikers after a rain.\n3) Seven Springs Trail is narrow in sections and can get very busy on weekends, especially with bikers."", 'This was a great hike!

The add-on to Hunter's Point is only 0.2 miles and includes an amazing view of the bay area. It was a clear enough day that we could see Downtown San Jose and further south all the way up north past the Dumbarton Bridge. Definitely worth doing. We completed the loop in under 2 hours, with very little stopping. Highly recommended for a nice easy going hike!"", 'Easy to moderate, pleasant quick workout trail.

The views were spectacular. You get a panoramic view of the entire Bay Area. As for difficulty, this hike was relatively easy and we only took a rest to look at the views.

Although this isn't my favorite trail, I would return."", ""This is a great spot. Not too much parking though. The hill climb in the beginning on a mountain bike is definitely challenging. The back side of the mountain has some banked turns and jumps on the down hill which is fun but watch your speed because there's always hikers there."", ""This trail is sunny and has lots of hills. Most of the trails are pretty wide. You could take a stroller if wanted to actually push it up and down all those hills. We saw several people with strollers. There's also lots of cyclist but they won't get in your way because the trails are wide enough. There's some shady areas but its mostly sunny. A good hike to do in the morning or cooler months. The driving directions took us to a trail head on Regnart. It's on the left as you head up the street. There's parking off the street for maybe 5 cars. If you want the main parking lot it's on Prospect not too far away. There's also 1 outhouse there. There's tons of trails connecting all over those hills and they are marked well. You could make your hike as long or short as you wanted depending how many trails you connect to. I would definitely go here again. It's a good workout. "", 'This is about 8 miles from where I live, so rode my bike there, but did see the parking lot was full on a nice Saturday afternoon.  Had planned to run the trails, but decided to try a little off-road riding. Trails are well maintained and would consider the hike medium  in terms of needed exersion. Many dogs on the trail, but saw little evidence of their droppings.  Thank you thoughtful dog owners!  Nice enough views of the valley.

a beautiful beautiful lovely', 'Tried to do this hike on 12/9/18. The southern most part of the trail along the creek seemed to be washed out or very poorly marked. Gave up on the hike because it seemed like there was no trail and it was getting close to sunset. Turned an intended 4.6 mile hike into a 10 mile hike as I backtracked most of the trail.', 'Good trail run. Easy to maneuver, lightly trafficked.', 'Great hike. Many interesting things to see.', ""i did this tail about a year ago. the first half of the loop was fun but after the decent, well, i didn't expect to be knee deep in creek. i had a friend with me who very much did not like the second half of this trail."", ""Please be careful if you do decide to attempt this counter-clockwise. \n\nI made the mistake of assuming this will be a reasonably moderate adventurous run (since I'm very familiar with the trails around here and am often found there when not working). The trail is washed out so you'll be bouncing left and right across the creek quite often. It gets slippery at certain parts (when most of the rocks have algae / moss). If you're careful and have good traction shoes, that part can be doable. But please be careful! Now when I hit the artificial waterfall, I didn't see anything there (I somehow missed the rope leading up the wall). I instead traced back 0.1mi and found a way to scramble up on the left side to what seemed to be a trail. I had tried to go somewhere on the right but the gates were all locked up and my mab showed that left side was reasonable. But I think the trail I ended up on was abandoned, since it ended. I slipped at one point and kept on sliding. Managed to find a way to hold on to branches, and out of fear of falling kept going up, holding on to whatever I can (which is hard given that there were only a few degraded sandstone pieces that were breaking off, a minimal amount of branches, and lots of dead leaves.) Ended up needing rescuing. Never thought I would ever need that in my life, and certainly not in my backyard. \n\nI admit my decision-making seems off (fear does wonders), but please be careful and don't underestimate this path. And as people suggested, perhaps try to go clockwise or go with a few friends so you can keeo each other in check and not get lost / hurt. \n\nEnjoy the trails and be smarter than me!"", ""We did this hike on April 12th. The front side of the hike is great, easy assent and beautiful views. The back side is a different story. After you reach the top you will wind your way around to a small trail that switchbacks down the slope, this trail is nice and easily navigable. At the bottom you will find some of the abandoned structures that are shown in the photos above. After this point the hike becomes rapidly less enjoyable. The trail is not maintained and you are essentially hoping back and forth from on side to the other of a creek. This annoyance was compounded by the large amounts of poison oak, if we hadn't both had long pants and sleeves we wouldn't have made it out without having some rashes. We are both seasoned hikers and enjoy difficult and technical hiking, but the backside of this trail is just pointlessly frustrating. My suggestion is to make it an out and back to the top."", 'Loved this trail for 4 out of 4.8 miles(going clockwise) BUT as many reviews (and park ranger will tell you) it just vanishes in the lowland swampy area. You can do it but give yourself plenty of time, light and phone battery because it’s not maintained at all. Otherwise, this hike is fantastic, great elevation, beautiful vistas, lots of cool canyons and mountains back there. Watch out for poison oak on the back side (going clockwise) it’s EVERYWHERE.', 'Not well maintained, trail difficult to follow', 'Really hard to find the trailhead (our GPS was off), but the loop was nice once we got going. We trekked clockwise, so there were great views for the first third, followed by a steep decline into the canyon (watch out for loose rocks), ending with a pretty technical ~1.5 mile stretch through the riverbed. Decent outing for sure, but you absolutely MUST check yourself for ticks afterwards.', 'Great hike but I only did one half of the loop because I got a little lost. I started at the inspiration point around 3pm. I missed the trail that leads to the creek(maybe because of the overgrown land?). But then it felt like I  was getting no where and there aren’t many signs, only the “backbone trail” one. I got service and realized I just kept walking straight and I was already about 2 miles away from the rustic loop trail.  Can be pretty adventurous and spooky at 6pm. So make sure you go with enough day light, or just don’t get lost like I did  hah', 'Some gorgeous views from along the ridge, although at the moment the trail portion along the creek going out from Will Rodgers is overgrown and not easily passable. Can be a cool setting but it is tough going along the creek.', ""Actually hiked this last week -loved it!! Started at end of polo field - counterclockwise.  Once you get to the creek, you will be crossing back and forth. Someone has used red paint to try and help people stay on the trail, but it's easier to see if you are heading clockwise.  You start on the west side of the creek, but pretty quickly cross to the east side. As soon as you cross keep looking on the opposite side for the trail to pick up.  You will be going back and forth far awhile! When you get to the waterfall, and  you don't feel like using a rope to climb up the wall near the waterfall - approx .05 - .1 miles before the waterfall, look on the opposite of the creek and you will see stairs going up. At the top of the stairs, very quickly, you will see a path on your right which will take you to the top of the waterfall.  From there, just scramble  up the hill and continue with the loop!  Recommend wearing shoes with a lot of tread so you can get traction crawling over the boulders in the creek and scrambling up the hills (at times I was grabbing the roots of various bushes to help pull myself up!) Challenging, but incredibly fun!!!"", ""This is a hard trail in the sense that when you get to the creek the path deteriorates fast.

Also, wear pants and throw on some bug spray for good measure.It's awesome and fun. Enjoy!!"", ""If you’re bringing children, a dog, or anybody afraid to descend rock faces,  don't do the whole loop. If you aren’t taking any of those things and want to do the whole loop, go clockwise. The eastern half of the loop, along Rustic Creek, is poorly defined and dangerously steep in some places. Seriously, there are one or two sections where you have to ascend/descend 25 feet up a near vertical rock face and sometimes the only apparent route forward is to walk in the creek. Stay near the creek, as getting lost is very easy. The brush is overgrown. Avoid the poison oak. \n\nThat said, the challenge of this section made hiking it a rewarding experience. But it's definitely not for everybody.\n\nIn contrast, the western half of the loop, up the backbone trail, is beautiful. It is well maintained and the views are great. It wasn’t crowded even on a Sunday and suitable for any hiker or dog."", 'Great hike loved the views...', 'Great hike loved the views...', 'Went counter clock wise into the canyon. Took us the wrong way and led us climbing the side of the mountain. The map said we were in the right spot but we were not, I slipped and tumbled 20 feet but luckily clinged to a tree branch. DO NOT RECOMMEND. Trail is terribly marked in the swamp and you got lost so easily. Go clockwise up the inspiration point trail. That way is beautiful', 'I haven\'t done hiking for a while before I decided to go on this trail. My husband and started on the eastern side and I\'m glad we did. I can\'t imagine how average hiker will deal with it. It\'s not so moderate - you basically have to climb the rock at your own risk. For us it was very adventurous and fun, but looking back now I think we were ""playing with devil"" going up the pretty steep rocks without any insurance. Overall I have say if you\'re an experienced hiker you\'d love doing this hike, it gives a variety of challenges and the views are breathtaking, but if you\'re not, then better stick to the Inspiration Point trail.', ""Thinking of taking your dog here? DONT. If you decide to go here make sure to take military 8 inch high boots so that you don't have water getting in your shoes. But even then you'll still need some gators. The eastern portion of the hike down Will Rogers Trail is not visible. It is literally walking thru the river in water that is stagnant and so full of algae it clings unto you. Also, make sure you have the downloaded maps or an actual map because the trail has not been kept in years and half the time you'll be deciding wether you're still on the trail. By the way for some of you adventurer folk that seek to go here when the river has not subsided to an acceptable level, beware: DEATH!If you were to go thru this river while it is high you wouldn't make it out. Even while it's low at 6 inches--4ft in some places, the algae causes you to slip. Trekking poles would be of no use as you are basically walking thru the river and playing 'Chicken Limbo' underneath tree trunks. Furthermore, please do not subject your dogs to this hike it is horrible for them. My dog made it but we have been hiking for a while since she was young. As for other dogs they need to be carried thru major portions of it. Either way, it is completely unenjoyable for them. Good luck. Make sure to have your hands free so that you don't crack your head open when you slip."", 'Whoever marked this trail as ""moderate"" probably did not do the full loop as it is shown. I started at the polo fields parking lot and went counterclockwise, starting with the creek portion. The maintained trail officially ""ends"" when you reach the creek, so to continue on the loop as shown on this map there\'s about a mile or two of leaping on boulders across the stream, traversing the steep and slippery rocks on the side of the stream, ducking under and climbing over fallen trees, grabbing onto branches so you don\'t fall in the water, and when you reach the waterfall, using a rope to climb straight up a rock wall 20 feet. Moderate, my ass. There\'s a reason why most people who track this trail don\'t complete the full loop as it\'s mapped. That being said, the hike is a lot of fun. Just be prepared to use your hands, get dirty, muddy, and very creative.', ""If you would like it to be easier I would suggest going down the mountain instead of up. It was helpful to have gps on this app since the trail isn't always marked."", ""Tried to do the canyon  part of this hike and the trail was closed. It says it is closed until June 15, 2017. So FYI. I ended up doing the inspiration point trail and then added to it by going up to the junction where you would head back down into the canyon past the highest point of the rustic loop. Then I turned around and came back down the way I came. Good hike even thought it wasn't what I had set out to do. The hike up wasn't that hard even though you go 900ft."", ""We did the hike counter-clockwise, ascending up Rustic Canyon.\n\nThe biggest issue is the over-grown factor when you're going up Rustic - plus there is a ton of graffiti.  Once you get to the backbone you're 70% complete, and the views are fantastic.  \n\nNext time we'll probably skip the loop and do it clockwise - and once we hit the ridge just turn around and make it an out-and-back."", 'Definitely not for beginners. The start of the trail from the end of the Polo field is sign posted ""not maintained"" they\'re  not kidding. After the first part of the trail winds off down to the creek bed the trail literally does not exist for a mile. So only walk this way if you plan on scaling rocks and getting wet. If you walk into the trail past the dry creek going clock wise from inspiration point then only traverse the creek if you are experienced.', ""Great trail for more experienced hikers! We took the trail clockwise starting from the top of the canyons which has some amazing views of the coastline from Malibu all the way down to palos verdes. About two miles in it takes a turn down deeper in to the mountain where it's pretty steep and rocky. Not too bad but then it starts to get harder once you reach the waterfall where you have to find your way down (about three stories from the top) and the trail is much harder to find. After finding our way down past a beehive and swarm of bees we followed along the river where the trail is sometimes on and off the river. There are some parts where you need to cross the water and or climb rocks along the side where you can easily lose your footing. We did consider turning back because we were pretty stumped on how to continue along the trail, almost went in to panic mode when we thought we were lost and would have to go all the way back lol. Once you reach the end of the river/trail you'll see the orange sign telling you the trail ends. Best feeling ever. Definitely one for the books.

It is not well maintained but it has amazing sight! Had lots if fun and will be back to conquer it! Ita more of a harder short trail ! You will get wet!', ""It's tough and beautiful. The first quarter of the hike is deep down in the canyon, following a creek which we had to cross at least 10 times, including some climbing. That strenuous part of the hike took us about half of our total time. Please note: the trail is NOT MARKED and NOT MAINTAINED!  You must have a sense of finding the right way, otherwise this hike is not the right one for you. After that it is a nice uphill to the top of the backbone trail, leading you down from there to the parking lot with beautiful views from downtown LA to Santa Monica.

So we had to backtrack 2 miles"", 'Great hiking gotta go again', 'Very good hike challenge the deeper you go happy camping mate', ""I like hiking, but I'm not physically fit for hiking uphills and going through rocky narrow paths and that's what this trail gave me mostly haha. Even though I feel like I almost died, this trail was such an adventure and we didn't even go through the graffiti abandoned buildings and the backbone bridge that everyone is talking about -- sadly, we didn't know about those spots. We had a friend who apparently has been here before who lead us through a looping wooden stairs (that's probably about 400 stairs) that's all covered in dirt and then we were supposed to go through this pathway thats over the edge of the mountain but it was closed so we decided to just go down, which was the muddy and wet creek area. Going through the creek was all our first times so we didn't even know what was ahead of us or what obstacles we had to face (even the guy who had been to Rustic Canyon trail before). Going through the creek felt like I was at an anaconda movie, thank goodness there weren't any snakes. After a rain and going through that creek with  a non hiking shoes was not the greatest idea, but again it was an adventure. Then we finally found an actual trail path which lead us to the Will Rogers park and walked up through an actual trail (that's when we started to see other hikers..I was so happy. I thought I'd never get outta that creek). About .5-a mile into this canyon trail, we got lost of trying to go back to where we started without going through the creek. So we went back. Back down and through the creek. And that's when we realized that there were poison oaks at the creek. Going back up was the hardest. I had to stop so many times and my two friends who was with me had to keep motivating me that we were almost there. Going back up those wooden stairs killed me more, I told my friends to just leave me. I couldn't feel my legs. \nIf anyone has hiked the Potato Chip Rock, this hike was worse for me. I got battle scars all over my body from branches and thorns to prove it and a sore ass body the next morning. Again, it was an adventure but never again."", ""This was an interesting adventure. I took this clockwise (I'd recommend the other way for better views). In the direction I went...\nThe hike up to the peak is a great trail, well maintained, with spectacular view of the LA basin and Santa Monica Bay. Could see all the way to downtown LA, San Pedro Hill, Catalina, and even Santa Barbara Island. \nThe trail down to Rustic Canyon is somewhat overgrown and seriously eroded (but empty, if you want solitude). Fairly steep in places.\nUpper Rustic Canyon has a number of deteriorated buildings and foundations, all covered in graffiti (an interesting psychedelic look on the 'barn'. Unfortunately, the graffiti extends to trees and rocks.\nLower Rustic Canyon is an 'unmaintained' trail... it's overgrown in places, but also it really means it is mostly in the creekbed, so with a few inches of water as there was today and many crossings, it requires some agility (and will result in wet feet, if you don't have good shoes).

Careful because they're steep!"", 'I feel lucky to have made it out from here the same day I started. I made the mistake of starting late and pushing my luck with daylight. I had not read the reviews here, so had no idea what I was in for. I came down from the Backbone trail into Rustic Canyon. After passing the camp, I first went wrong by following the road that heads to the left. However, I realized this wasn\'t the path when the road took a sharp turn left and headed the wrong way. I retraced and found the path, but was completely unprepared for being plunged into the foliage and the accompanying darkness (it was almost sunset). Afraid of getting lost in the dark, I plunged forward at an almost-spring pace. I dread to think of the number of spider webs, ticks, poison oak, snakes and other scary things I must have pushed past as I collided with all manner of branches. I lost whatever trail there was many times, and found myself pausing frequently to work out which of the slight spaces in the bush was a trail. Fortunately, the trail and I stayed close to the stream and whenever I thought I was completely lost, some sort of path emerged from the stream bed. Eventually I reached the dam/waterfall and thought I was at a dead end. An obvious, very dusty trail ascended at a near-cliff angle up to the left. I tried to make my way up, but very quickly slipped and almost fell down the dam. I thought better of it and searched for another path and finally found the path off to the right of the dam which took me down past it. I thought I would be in the clear then, but it only got worse. Eventually I found the stream entered a ravine with sharp walls on either side. For the first time, there was absolutely no sign of any path anywhere. I tried retracing my steps for a while, but I couldn\'t find any trail. After 5 minutes of doing this, I gave up. I thought about heading back to the camp and up the road, but it was now almost completely dark (sunset had happened over 20 minutes before) and I was very afraid of getting completely stuck out here. I even started to make plans for the night (and to entertain thoughts of getting consumed by a mountain lion). I didn\'t think I could afford to go back, so my survival instincts kicked in and I decided to just wade downstream from there. In the dark, I almost tripped and got submerged many times (and almost lost my iPhone -- terror!), but ploughing down the stream turned out to be my best decision, as the going was much easier and I could see slightly better. I just hoped there weren\'t leaches under there (vivid memories of ""Stand by Me""). Thank God I had the AllTrails iPhone map and had downloaded the trail, because (1) this reinforced the decision to stick to the stream (if I had gone off to the side, I\'m sure I would have been lost all night), and (2) I could tell that the trail had to make a hard right at one point. At that point, on blind faith I left the stream bed (I didn\'t see any signs) and hiked uphill on a slight gap in the bushes that could have been an animal path. To my great relief, I suddenly found myself on a real trail, with wooden railings and all, and made my way back to the parking lot in only another 10 minutes.  A ranger was by my car (giving me a ticket) and if I had been two minutes later, I would have been stuck in the park all night. I feel thankful I made it out. DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS IN POOR LIGHT and I *highly* recommend a GPS/map combo, like the AllTrails App, or else you could get very lost. As others have said, go round the dam to the right and stick to the stream (don\'t be afraid to wade) and you\'ll end up okay.', ""The trail pretty much disappears under overgrowth and poison oak after the old barn (if doing the loop clockwise). \n\nFun and interesting hike if you have a GPS and patience to find the hidden trail along the creek, but don't underestimate the time it takes to make it through the canyon.

amazing. The route totals about 12 miles and is perfect for a 1 nighter if you\'re backpacking\n\nIf you\'re starting at Big Basin then you will need a permit which is easy to get and you have to park at JAY CAMP not the headquarters. \n\nI would HIGHLY recommend to plan the logistics on who will pick you up and drop you off if you do not plan on hiking back up. There are no UBERS or LYFT there once you reach the beach. I was lucky and was able to hitch hike off a ""van lifer"" that just so happened to have slept at the beach the night before.', 'My friend and I hiked this trail in 8 hours and 31 minutes. It was fun. The trail is 30 miles. Keep in mind my friend and I took a wrong turn which cost us valuable time. We could have hiked this trail in 8 hours if we had not wasted half an hour looking for the right path. We were racing the sun since we did it in January. The park ranger in Big Basin said we might be hiking in the dark and the risk factor was very high. We proved him wrong and finished 40 minutes before sunset.', 'My wife and I did the thru hike in late December over three days/ 2 nights. We got a late start the first day and hiked the last 2 miles in the dark to waterman gap from castle rock. This part of the hike is poorly labeled at some points, so make sure to talk with the ranger at castle rock if you have not done this hike before! Second day we hiked to Jay camp at big basin hq. There is a store and rangers readily available in case you need anything. This night got pretty cold, but we were ok with 15 deg bags. Last day we hiked to Waddell creek via the ridge trail, which is a few miles shorter but does about 1800 ft of elevation. This trail is very challenging and is mostly downhill. If you have any weather or are tired I would stick to the skyline to sea trail. But the views from the ridge trail are amazing! All in all this is a great trip and well worth the effort!', 'We started at Castle Rock instead of Saratoga Gap. This was highly recommended by the rangers and afforded us beautiful scenic views on Day 1 until meeting up with the traditional trail which mostly follows the highway for the first day. \n\nDay 1: Starting from Castle Rock, hiked 9.5 miles to Waterman Gap Camp. Super remote, but had a bathroom and water spout so it was perfect. Campsite 1 is the best!\nDay 2: Hiked another 9/10 miles to Jay Camp in Big Basin Redwoods State Park. There are facilities here and it is not as remote but still great.\nDay 3: The last ~ 10 miles take you back to Waddell Beach.  A much recommended detour visits Berry Creek Falls. We actually ended this night at a beach in Davenport at the main stoplight across the highway from the restaurants. There were fire pits for a bonfire and we stayed the night on the beach. This was actually our favorite night. \n\nThe trail is closer to 30 miles than 25. We parked one car at Waddell Beach and another at Castle Rock since there is NO SHUTTLE and none of us had phone service either. The start and end points are roughly one hour away from each other driving. \n\nWEATHER was GREAT, btw. We slept half in our bags as we had really warm nights even now in mid-October. Overall a great trip and I highly recommend it for this time of year when it is really cold elsewhere.', 'Did it in one day, starting at Hwy 9 and 35 , finishing at Waddell Beach. Its around 29-30miles, not 25. Took us 9.5hrs excluding 2 breaks to eat and tape up our feet. Would have done it in 2 days but Big Basin is reservation only and books 2 months in advance so book early.', 'Completed the trail in 2 nights & 3 days. 1st day hiking was harder than the other 2 days. Basin was  crowded. Tip: A couple people thought to break in their shoes on this trail = lots of blisters. Also, bring poles if you have bad knees = lots of downhill.', 'Started at Castle Rock HQ, ended at Waddell Beach and loved every minute of this hike. Camped at Waterman Gap and then Jay camp and both were in good shape and nice. Thanks to our awesome state park rangers, staff and volunteers! Definitely would do this again.', 'Super fun. Ran skyline to sea marathon with Pacific Coast Trail Runs. Very fun event. Highly recommend.', 'Did 11 miles out and back since I couldn’t get a ride home from the beach. Downhill helps but there are some climbs for sure. Take plenty of water.', 'Perfect Beginner Backpacker 3-Day Trip. Don’t camp in your car the night before hitting the  trail. Ranger Rick didn’t like that at all. Otherwise the trail follows a highway for the first two days. The second day you stop by Big Basin HQ where you can reload on any food or gear you may need. Even have showers. Third day you leave the highway sounds and follow a creek that leads to the ocean. This is the most rewarding and beautiful day. (Camped at Waterman Gap and Jay Camp)Apparently the shuttle no longer exists. We hitchhiked to downtown Santa Cruz and then 50$ Uber’d to our car at Castle Rock State Park. Weather was never permitting long sleeves, even at night. The shade under the tree groves was perfect, no chance of getting sunburned. Mosquitoes were heavy though and had to remain in our tents any time we weren’t moving.', 'Did this again on weekend of 6-29-18.  Has become my early season Sierra stretch out.  Really nice and bugs not bad. No trail hassle with deadfalls, but make sure you get into your trail camps early to get a decent pitch area.  Not a solitude destination with road noise and weekend campers at Big Basin, but a great trek nonetheless.', 'Did this with 3 of my family members and a friend, decided to cut a mile off the hike by going down a ""equestrian trail"" what a mistake. As we got to the bottom sign reads not advised for hikers. this is mostly a downhill hike all the way. Very hard on the knees. Got to the point I thanked God for any up hill parts of the hike. Beautiful scenery. I say go for it. I am 55 years old.', 'My husband, 11 year old son, and myself tackled this one last summer. It was our first through hike. The trees were enormous and we found the scenery inspiring. the camp grounds were easy to find and well maintained. We had no problem refilling water bottles at the camp sites. At the end there was a moment of of wonder and achievement as we caught site of the ocean. I just wish there had been an easier way to find the trailhead and some way to call a shuttle at the end as we had no cell reception and had family “guessing “ when to pick us up.', 'A friend and I walked from Castle Rock to Big Basin. We certainly could have finished at Waddell Beach in one day. There is day parking available throughout the Skyline-to-the-Sea Trail and you can pick up the trail in various spots. This is a fairly easy, uneventful trail. We saw a deer and a turkey, felt (!) loads of mosquitos and heard the gunshots. All in, I’m disappointed to say that this is my least favorite trail in the Bay Area. It lacks gorgeous views throughout most of the trail and the logistics are cumbersome. Still if you want to log 30+ miles and end up in the beach, here are a few tips: call the Big Basin headquarters and check for trail closures the day before and aim for a cool day as the trail can get unbearably hot. And do NOT rely on a cellphone connection to call a Uber/Lyft, taxi or friend.', ""I'd give this hike 2.5 stars, so I'm being generous rounding up to 3 stars.\nI don't typically write reviews, but I felt indebted since I often use AllTrails, and I wished someone had told me what I'm about to write -- so hopefully what I write can serve as value for someone in the future.\n\nWe backpacked this trail in 2 days, spending 1 night at Jay Camp (near Big Basin HQ).\nAs most have commented, it's more popular to backpack over 3 days, and I didn't see any comments regarding 2 days, so that's my purpose for posting in detail.\n\nFirstly, especially important for backpackers, unless you're getting dropped off, you can't start at Saratoga Gap, you'll need to start at Castle Rock (for parking a car) which will add additional mileage (~3 to 5, depending on which trails you take to meet up with Skyline-to-Sea). \nWe didn't know about the extra distance, and the popularly noted first day hike to Waterman Camp is only ~8 miles, which felt short for one day, hence our decision to try to squeeze the more popular Day 1 & Day 2 hikes into just one Day.\nAlso, a significant portion of this hike is along the side of the highway (though not directly on the highway, you can clearly see and hear the cars zooming by and you're often walking along side peoples private property and houses) which I find to be a huge drawback and is why I'm subtracting at least 1 stars from the rating. You can take some alternative trails, as we did, to minimize the portion along the side of the highway, but this adds more distance to the total hike and you'll still be spending a significant amount of time along the highway regardless.\nAll in all, it took us over 20 miles to backpack from Castle Rock to Jay Camp, which is a lot longer than the estimated 15 miles we had in mind, and this can be an extremely tolling addition, especially when carrying 50lb backpacks.\nWe also found that the trails weren't always clearly marked and the trail markers present were few and far between, so you're often unsure how much distance is remaining and you also can sometimes get confused and question if you're on the right trail.  This fact is another reason why I'm subtracting a star.\n\nIn summary, I found the best part of the trip to be the first few miles starting in Castle Rock to the High Way (taking as many alternative routs to avoid getting to high way quickly) as well as the last part of the trip from Jay Camp / Big Basin HQ to the Waddell Beach.\n\nIf done again, I would simply do an out&back from from Waddell Beach to Jay Camp / Big Basin HQ OR an out&back from Castle Rock to Waterman Camp instead of doing the Skyline-to-Sea.\nOther downside (which effects my rating) that I want to note are; from Castle Rock to Waterman Camp you hike near a gun club and hear a lot of gunfire which is disheartening when trying to enjoy the sounds of nature and, as other folks have noted and I feel honor bound to repeat, Big Basin HQ is very popular and crowded with tourist, so it can get loud and not as relaxing to camp and enjoy the sounds of nature."", ""I hiked this trail on the weekend from the Saratoga Gap parking lot to Waddell Beach. I did it in one day, starting at 8:30am and finishing around 4:30pm with an average pace of about 20min per mile. This was a comfortable pace for me since most of the time it's downhill. At 8:30am, the parking lot was already 50% full, so come early! At Waddell Beach you'll have full cell phone reception with Verizon but non with AT&T. So factor that in in case you need to organize a ride back up."", ""What a visually stunning hike! One of the most beautiful old growth redwood forests I've had the pleasure of hiking through. From about 2 miles before Big Basin Headquarters and all the way to 1 mile from Berry Creek Falls, are pure trail magic. We hiked the Saratoga Gap route (which I recommend), and experienced stunning views within the first few miles. Diving into the old growth redwoods on day one was amazing. The next 15 miles hiking through BIg Basin is out of this world. SO gorgeous. Overall, this trail is wonderful. Great hike for beginning backpackers.  We used this trail as an early season backpacking trip trip, and had a great timei\n\n\nCons:\n-Hiking along Hwy 9 loses the backcountry experiance.\n-Waterman Gap Camp forces you to camp quite close to neighbors.\n-Camping at Big Basin Headquarters is extremely touristy."", ""A great 3 day hike for beginners. Beware if you are looking for views of the coast and oceans, this is not a hike for you as most of the trail goes deep into the redwoods. I would recommend arriving early at Big Basin Redwood State park to get a camping spot through the lottery (if you don't have one ahead of time). Other than that, the path was very well indicated, my only complaint is that at times the trail went along Highway 9, so on weekends it's not unusual to hear cars driving by."", 'It was okay, not my favorite.', ""A great starter backpacking trip, although I recommend having one experienced backpacker in your group. We split this into 3 days and for us it was the perfect amount of time. Beautiful scenery, especially between Big Basin and Waddell Beach, where you feel like you've stepped back in time to the prehistoric days. Hips and feet were a bit sore by the end of the third day. Taking off my boots and putting my feet in the water has never felt so good!"", 'Did this with my husband for our anniversary a year ago. My first official backpacking trip! We took 3 days. Tips for the person picking you up, be sure they know where they are going! A breakdown in communication had us waiting almost 2 hours, there is no cell service at Waddell Beach. I would do it again and split the hike into two sections instead of three. I would also stay an additional night in Big Basin to explore that area more!', 'Four of us decided to do the Saratoga Gap to Waddell Beach hike all in one day. In order for us to accomplish it form sunrise to sundown we needed to run a good portion of it. We estimate we ran about 15 miles of it with on and off with breaks of course. We are all active, but none of us are long distance or avid runners. The trail is well marked and soft and moderate for the most part. It was difficult and arjurous trek to do in one day. We took 8 hours total with about 1 to 1.5 hours of breaks. We took a long break at big basin where we grabbed a quick bite at the store, then kept going until we hit the beach at 3:45pm. \n\nI would not recommend hiking this entire trail in 1 day unless you can keep a 3.5 mph speed non stop, otherwise you are looking at a 12-14 hike to complete without running. \n\nTo the guy that complained about view and there only being redwood trees. He is right there are only redwood trees, lots of them. The only complaint I have is not of the trail itself ,but of the beach. It was very sandy and I got it all over my feet and inside my shoes way too sandy for my taste. \n\nEnjoy!', 'Beautiful hike through the redwoods. We did it in a day. The only problem was it was a 30 mile hike not 25 as it is called out here. That meant our timing got messed up. We were supposed to reach the sea by sunset and instead had to hike the last part with flashlights and missed the sunset!', '....planning this for the first time. gonna break it into two days from big basin. Just not sure how I am getting up to big basin yet...and back home.', ""It was an amazing trip. Too my dad and I two days. It's best to have someone drop you off at the beginning and pick you up at the end."", 'So we dove head first into this trail as my first backpacking trip. Going in January was a risk but the weather was perfect. We started at Castle Rock staging area and headed towards Waterman Gap. The views here are epic and the trail was a great challenge. My friend and I were very wore out by the time we made it to Waterman Gap. It was a great day. Waterman Gap was a cool little place and we were glad to see there was a bathroom and water. We had our choice of sites since we were the first ones to arrive. I found a good site with perfectly spaced trees for my hammock. We were bummed you can’t have a fire. Woke up the next morning and headed out toward Jay camp. This was by far the toughest day. The climb out of camp is 3 miles long. Anyone that says this is “all downhill” never did this climb! Once we got to the top of China Grade we only had about 4.7 miles to get to Jay camp. We arrived at park headquarters at 4:15 and the gift shop closed at 4:00 so no goodies for us. We hikes to Jay camp and chose site 6 for the night. Barely found trees that worked with my hammock. We slept good and headed out about 9:00. We were both pretty sore headed into day 3 but this was by far the best day. Leaving headquarters brought us deep into the forest that felt like we were in a different world. We had to take a little detour because part of the trail was closed but the atmosphere made it worth while. Another 10.5 miles to the beach!! All in all it was an epic trip. Most of the people we met thought that we were crazy doing this hike as our first backpacking trip but we made it!!!', 'What should I say, I very much looked forward to this hike after someone had recommended it to me. And then what do you know, last year\'s rainy season had pretty much closed off the whole trail and I had to wait another 3 months, until April of 2017, to hike it. The anticipation welled and and April had rounded the corner. I\'ll just get down to business. I was disappointed. More than an entire third of the hike runs alongside a paved road (with cars!). The first trail camp is conveniently located along a tokyo drifting hot-spot and offers bountiful tire-screeching and engine-revving for the no-sleep enthusiasts. The second ""trail"" camp (Jay\'s trail camp) isn\'t even a flipping trail camp. It\'s at big Basin HQ and let\'s just say look forward to the crowds and gift shops to complete your wilderness experience. Anywho Berry Creek Falls was pretty cool...', ""Loved all the scenery, steady slope of trail, cushioned, great weather for mNovember, but the first half of the hike (castle rock to Jay camp) just hugged a road the whole time. My group and I felt like hitchhikers and didn't get the satisfaction that we were hiking deep into the redwoods. Second half was MUCH BETTER (Jay camp to Waddell beach) and would definitely do that section again!"", 'First backpacking experience. Only did the roundtrip hike/camp from Castle Rock SP to Waterman Gap.Downhill to Waterman - pretty much all uphill back to Castle Rock. Good variety in terms of scenery. Took off 1 star because of gunfire and highway noise (although honestly not a big deal). Looking forward to completing the entire Skyline to Sea Trail in the future.', 'Can\'t believe there are people actually complaining about ""too many redwoods""- you just don\'t appreciate redwoods properly.  Anyways, only 4 outta 5 cause signs can be awful at points.  Started up at Castle Rock and didn\'t find out about the trail still being closed until I got to Big Basin- thanks for the heads up, guys.  I guess the powers that be can write endless tickets should someone stay past sundown, but they can\'t update the main park sign or post anything to reflect the new distance.  Was trying to do this in a day and had to turn back after Berry Creek Falls, was already at 23 miles coming into Big Basin originally due to previous unclear signs and some bad planning on my part.  The 4 sided posts with arrows going in vague directions often don\'t help- just mark the side facing where the hiker will be coming from with ""Trail X, take right, trail Y, take left""- I\'m confused as to why this isn\'t the standard.  Then I missed Sunset Connector Trail (only sign for it was on the back of the post, so you\'d only see it coming from one direction), not sure if that woulda worked as the detour posted at Big Basin HQ was the 12 mile Berry Creek one- ya, just a mess of a hike in terms of clear directions.  Anyways, as to why it\'s still a dope hike- Castle Rock is a beautiful place to start in the morning, loved seeing clouds cover the valley with my ultimate (unreached) destination, the sea, in the distance.  The stretch beside the road isn\'t the best, but there\'s enough to keep you interested.  There are some open sections over some interesting rock formations, plenty of impressive redwoods, and there is some wildlife- lizards, hawks up at Castle Rock if you start later, and I saw a green snake chowing down on a mouse which was insane.  Obviously I can\'t review the whole thing since I had to stop short, but it\'s a heck of a thru-hike taking you through some nicely varied terrain- and yes, there are lots of Redwoods, still can\'t believe people manage to make that a negative.  Anyways, I\'m planning on finishing the last 12+ miles once my feet hate me a bit less, heck of a hike from what I did cover though!', ""Great hike, around 31 miles in total, 3 days. I'm a beginner backpacker and I found this beautiful and not too challenging. We had a nice slow and steady pace throughout, around 2mph, and I found that very doable.\n\nWe started at Castle Rock around noon on Tuesday. There are some exposed sections and a couple of short scrambles around Goat Rock. Also: beautiful views. We stopped for a snack at Castle Rock trail camp (pit toilet, water), and then left for Waterman Gap. Camp was quiet and secluded, but near highway 9. Car noise died down early and we had a peaceful nights sleep. There's water and a pit toilet, no food lockers. Total day of 9.3 miles. \n\nDay 2 we started around 8:30 and hiked the 10 miles to Big Basin Headquarters. There are a few short exposed sections here as well, and some steep up and downs. I didn't find it very challenging, and enjoyed it. Took a long lunch break at HQ, it was crowded, but we were able to grab some supplies we needed and a quick snack. Left for Sunset camp around 2:30, made it there around 5. I've done the reverse hike (Berry Falls to HQ via Sunset trail) and found it more challenging in that direction than going this way. Did feel like we were a little late getting to the camp, many of the sites were occupied by large groups, and only small/awkwardly placed ones were left. There are food lockers and a pit toilet, no water. Water is available about .4 mile away, down a fairly steep grade, at the falls. We'd stocked up at HQ and decided to skip it till morning. The total for the day was 14.3 miles.\n\nDay 3 started around 7:30, hiked down to Berry Falls and spent some time filtering our water for the day. It's a beautiful spot and there was no one around that early. First couple miles are a little varied, steep decline along the falls to start, than some ups and downs, but the last 5 miles or so are wide, flat, and easy. We stayed on the bike trail rather than the hiker bypass because my partner was having some shoe troubles, and finished around noon. The day's total was 7 miles. \n\nWould highly recommend this for entry-level backpacking, helps to have an experienced friend."", 'nice day jog. started at Castle Rock around 10 a.m. finished the 25 miles shortly after night fall.

Such beautiful scenery and amazing trail. Going from the mountains to the ocean so mostly downhill but always more uphill than I remember. For a long hike, so far to me this is as good as it gets. Only done it as a day hike, although there are two potential campgrounds along the way. If you run the flats and downhills you can finish in less than 6 hours. Or you can take your time. Refill water at Big Basin HQ."", ""Great trek through a mostly shaded canopy over three days.  Day 1: ~9.5 miles, trail time 4.5 hrs. Began at Castle Rock SP at noon and overnighted at Waterman Gap. There are exposed, hot areas as you leave Castle Rock, but you will descend into the shade after about an hour.  Water as you cross the San Lorenzo River, about half way.  Shaded all the way to Waterman.  Nice campground, piped water and a pit toilet. No food lockers so plan on hanging your food. Day 2: ~9.5 Left Waterman at 7:30 am and was at Big Basin HQ by 12:30.

Left Big Basin at 7:15 and arrived at Wadell Beach at 12:30.  Leaving Big Basin, it is a climb up and out of the basin, but then mostly downhill from there. The last 6 miles after passing the Berry Creek Falls area, is     mostly flat as it follows Wadell Creek.  There is a small hike up and down before getting to the Racho Del Oso trailhead and then about 15 minutes down the road to the beach. No cell service, so plan your ride accordingly if you don't have a car parked.  Permits are required and necessary for any trail camp you stay at.  This could be done in two days, but they will be long. Overall, the trail has an elevation loss, but it is up and down all the way.  The only knock on this is the massive number of people in Big Basin, so it lacks solitude within that area, but do this trip a relaxing three days with decent and very doable mileage."", 'Beautiful redwood groves - one qualm is being near the highway for a pretty good stretch but minimal traffic.', 'great trail started off by the nutmug trail took it down to the medows and continued on for about ten miles ....the journey down was breath taking but the jouny back up was a different story...lol', 'A beautiful backpacking trip though there is a lot of downhill  through Big Basin Redwoods State Park. \nWe backpacked this trail in June and the water was gushing, and ferns were a vibrant green.

Storm damage is evident throughout the trail, but there's nothing too difficult or impassable. Currently one section is closed, just after you pass through Big Basin HQ up to Berry Creek Falls. You take the Howard King Trail as a detour, and although this trail only adds an extra ~3 miles give yourself time to move slower! Its almost entirely steep uphill and downhill, with little in between. It does offer some fantastic views though! The detour is by far the most challenging part, the rest of the trail is mostly a easy, gentle downhill. After the detour there's a side trail to Berry Creek Falls.

You'll be dodging day hikers every 2 minutes with no room for yourself.\n\nTLDR:  Overall I give it two stars.

Day 3 from Big Basin to Waddell starts with 2 miles of climbing steadily (not hard) and then is a gradual downhill for the rest of the day. One of the other reviewers here said it's steep downhill, which it isn't. Maybe a few very small parts, but it's a super easy last day along the creek, past some farms, and out to the beach.

Not many places between SF and big sur that provides this type of experience.', 'Two of us are doing the trail from 9/22 to 9/25 - we only have one car so if anyone else is hiking those days and is willing to carpool, please email me at keelssd(at)gmail(dot)com. If anyone has any suggestions on how to get a ride back, that would be greatly appreciated also!', 'This is an awesome trail. Generally done over the course of 2-3 days, we did the whole 32(ish) miles in one day, about 10.5 hours. Starting at Saratoga Gap / going east to west is mostly downhill, which does make it a little tough on the knees.\n\nCheck out my whole review  here: http://bettermoveonfrog.com/2013/05/skyline-to-the-sea-part-1/', ""This was the first major hike I have ever completed and it was amazing. My fianc and I did the 7 mile hike to berry creek falls and back to Waddell beach. There are some inclines along the way but it wasn't too bad. Occasionally ran into other hikers. Beautiful scenery along the way. Great views of the beach and you hear the rushing creek along the way of the hike. You cross a couple bridges and see tons of wild flowers and berry bushes, butterfly, birds, lots of little lizards and harmless snakes. It was a beautiful hike. Seems great for mountain biking too :)"", ""I've done this trail a number of times over the last 5 years.  Each time, I start at Castle Rock State Park and return, making it a 6 day hike.  It's a great early season hike when the Sierras have too much snow."", 'My wife and I have biked this trail a dozen times or more and always enjoy it.  Park in the parking lot along highway 1 and bike in along a road which turns to trail after passing a few farms growing vegetables and flowers.  It is shaded and relatively flat but slightly uphill going inland,  as it runs along a creek for most of the trip.  At the end you can park your bike and walk further to the falls. Takes us a bit more than an hour total.  Would not try it in wet weather as the path next to the creek in some places may be difficult.', 'A must for BA hikers. Not sure if anyone else does this but My friend in I conquered the trail in 1 day insteadof three! read about it on my blog and follow it if you like it!\n\nhttp://markhertzler.tumblr.com/', 'Would love to hike the skyline to the sea trail at some point... trying to find the time! Would Oct / Nov be a good time to do it?', ""I've done the full trail once and most of the trail a second time.  It's a great 3 day trip and fairly easy (slight downhill the whole way).  You pass a variety of scenery and terrain (rocky and dry to forests with creeks, all the way to the ocean).  You feel far away from people most of the hike, but can still stop at the Big Basin headquarters if you want to pick some stuff up (like marshmallows...).  Great hike, nice scenery, very highly recommend it!"", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '',

I felt safe on this trail and never once had a bad feeling while walking up there. There were many trails but I took the powder canyon trail since It seemed the easiest not to get lost on! it lead to a loop of dirt near some power towers which I was kinda disappointed in, no view at all!

I was a little confused at first when I got there becasue it mixes with a trail that loops the parl itself. The park trail is the 2.6 mile walk, where as the widerness south of it into the hills is the tougher hike most reviews here  illustrate- as well as mine. I opted for a large loop of the entire Powder Canyon region starting with a hike uop the main central road and left up the narrow path onto the Schabarum path ""extention"" trail. This zigzags up the hill side and drops over thetop heading for Fullerton rd. Once near Fullerton rd, look for the double electical towers and make a sharp right slightly uphill away from the homes nearby, then left onto the service access road (this part was a lttle confusing as we had to backtracck to that point a few hundred yards when we ended up almost to the sidewalk of Fullerton Rd and fenced off from the widerness)/ At the bottom of the access road and the utility center, we headed south on Nogalas trail to a parking area again near another corral. Passing the gate here, we proceeded to Powder Canyon and followed that all the way up then left onto Purple Sage trail- this is an adequate climb all the way up to nice scenic views south to OC.as we merged onto the right  top path at a broken gate and kept climbing. That trail eventually levels off and winds westward around  the point then downhill and another sharp right north. Here the trail winds a bit again on a very slight uphill grade away for the water tower to the south path and ends up in a confusing point again beneath a few electrical towers. A quick survey of the area showed we had to climb a little rise of one tower on the right side of the road and picked up the unmarked Schabarum path that headed back east/noth/ east directions as it twists its way down a gradual decent to the west end of the Schabarum Regional Park where we began. The entire loop without the few cutback mistakes measures out a nice 7.6 mile loop completely circumferencing the wntire wilderness area of Schabarum Park/Powder Canyon. \n\nAll in all, coming on the heals of ""Bridge to Nowhere"" and ""Big Santa Anita loop"", my buddy and I were both pleasantly surprise to have a feel of a mountain hike, but with the fireroad sections of the trail making up about half the distance, it did seem a little too close to home/civilization to render it a real adventure. Thus 4 stars for a first time experience.', ""I just got back into hiking and decided to come to Schabarum I like to hike in the early mornings I didn't go all the way because I had to work but there was some shade I suggest hiking shoes they have better traction then running shoes, bring water for sure a hat.  I notice people listening to their i-phones I don't see why I would rather listen to my surroundings and not be distracted my opinion.  I came alone but better if you bring a friend with you.  I hope you decide to come hiking here and hope I tip was helpful.  Oh I ate some fruit before starting only because I'm diabetic so bring your meds."", ""Lots of parking!!!! Yay!!! Went on a Sunday....paid $6 to park all day.  Lots of short trails. My sister and I did a few little trails....all add up to a little over 3 miles. Some steep hike going up to the water tower. Lots of dog and horse poop. Also, lots of Asian people. I am asian too :) We went at 7am; that's when the park open but we saw people in there way before the park open. I'm sure you can park on the street and just start hiking. There are camping grounds there too. Over all a good hike for beginners. My sister didn't like it much because we were so close to houses and a lot businesses. It's across from a shopping mall and shopping plaza. She like to go on hikes with mountain views or waterfalls at the end of the hike. I didn't mind it at all. It was a little crowded on the hiking trail at 7am. Some of these Asian will not step aside for you. They hog up the trail and if their in front of you going slow, you kind of have to hang in there until the trail get a little wider, then you can quickly go around them."", 'Good trail! Recommend!', 'By far this is my favorite trail. It has great views and great workout. It has moderate shade but it is still great. Try to go in the evenings because there are a lot more snakes in the early mornings. Do watch out for mountain bikers as they sometimes do not warn you they are on their way down. Easy to find parking :)', ""Great hike! The park itself seemed pretty busy, but the hiking trails were not. I went on a Sunday around 11:30 and had no trouble finding parking. The beginning of the hike (first 20-30) minutes is a bit tough as it's pretty steep, but the remainder is relatively flat. Very little shaded area along the trail which is the only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5, so don't forget water! I brought my dog and she got pretty hot towards the end and kept trying to lay down in every shady spot:) Great wildlife, saw a few hummingbirds, squirrels and other birds and butterflies. Didn't see any rattlesnakes but heard them in the bushes not too far away, so while it's a rule anyway, I'd definitely recommend leaving your dog on leash."", 'Free parking during weekdays. There are lots of trails with great view. My favorite trail stars behind the horse camp site.', ""Really fun and challenging trail.To avoid paying for parking I park across the street and ride into Schabarum park. I stay East into to the park and take the first trail on the left, which is a double track that rides the perimeter of the park, until I pass the horse stables. This is where the fun begins. Heading south towards Powder Canyon for roughly 100m I take the single track on my left that'll lead me thru some crazy-fun uphill switchbacks. If you get the chance, bombing down these are a must if your looking for an out and back run. However on this track, once you get to the top it's almost nothing but a fast and windy single track on a gradual decline all the way to tHarbor/Fullerton Rd. Head south on the side walk and turn right onto Old Fullerton Rd. jump on the fire trail immediate after the water tanks and drop gears because you'll be in for a long steady climb to try top. Once you've accomplished this just ride the fun and windy trail west till the trail T's, then go right ( north ) for a few easy inclines followed by some smooth sailing back into the park. I love this trail and can't wait to do it again!"", 'Hidden gem.   Has many connecting trails.  Have done at different times and days of the week and at times it has been crowded and other times deserted.   Highly recommend.   Great views.', 'First time on this trail in years. You must get there early before the sun gets to high but it is a good workout to the summit. The trail from the entrance on Colima climbs and connects to the Buena Vista trail near the summit. Great views of the San Gabriel Mountains and the Valley below. Great Hike.', 'Great challenging trail, hope to someday mountain bike this trail.', 'This review is coming from an extreme couch potato so please keep that in mind.  I went up the west side of the hill and came down the east side and I had to stop several times to catch my breathe and gain my strength back.  But I kept the goal in mind and was able to make it to the top!!\n\nI saw more butterflies in 30 minutes than I saw all summer in the city.  I saw squirrels and birds and I heard a California Quail.  I saw a fair amount of people walking the trail, many of which were older which was quite humbling.  :)\n\nSome beautiful scenery and it was refreshing to walk from the sunlight into the shady cool areas of the hill.  Had a great time and a good nap when I got home!', ""This was the first hiking trip I ever took. It wasn't hard, thank goodness. You do have to watch out for horse poop and animals and poison oak, though. There are tons of families having birthday parties and stuff because it is a park. Parking is easy to find because there are a lot of areas to do so and there is sure to be a trail close to where you parked."", 'great views. 5 mile hike is a bit tough.  There are 4 or 5  links to other hikes ranging from 2 to 8 miles. crowds are light.  switchbacks are easier than the straight schabarum trail. some shade along the way. great for beginners and moderate hiking.l', 'This a fun little hike for the kids.

I was the only one on most of the trail.  A very easy 8 miles except for the last half mile of the loop back up to Rocky Peak turnoff.  That was very steep.  I climbed up it. I think going down would have been just as hard, but I have bad knees.  It was a good hike.', 'love this trail..', 'This was my first time hiking in the Simi Valley Rocky Peak area. I really enjoyed it. Instead of simply doing an out and back to the peak, I did the loop at the top - continue north on Rocky Peak Trail to the next fire road, then back down to a fire road cut off to the right (at the big tree stay to the right.)  This additional loop turned a short 4.6 mile into a nice 8 mile hike.  I was alone throughout most of the loop. Cool rock formations, peaceful surroundings, great hike.', 'This hike offers great views of the San Fernando and Simi Valleys!

The view is just amazing.', 'A very wide an open trail easy to find from the exit of the freeway. Sandy and rocky the whole way the trail winds and twists as it ascends through the mountains. The sounds of the highway eventually dropping away to pleasant silence. There is an interesting sandstone cave open on two ends early on the trail. The landscape looks to be filled with scrub brush, boulders, and plenty of side trails branching off in all directions for those that want to explore features in the distance. Please exercise caution if you choose to do this. The main trail is easy to follow and is about as wide as a small street. Not too hard but certainly a good workout the trail is fairly moderate with some steep sections and an extended steep section as the last push before the summit. Well worth the trip with good views of Simi Valley, and the San Fernando Valley. The trail seemed well traveled on the day I did it but was not so crowded that one could not enjoy peaceful solitude. Will certainly tackle this trail again.', 'Its a brutal climb to the top with a mountain bike. But well worth it for the view and long descent. The down hill portion is fun, and a little chunky in some parts. But nothing too difficult. Not recommended for beginners though.', 'The rocky topography (boulders all around) distinguishes this trail from others in the L.A. area. Definitely a good workout-steady uphill climb to the peak (more intense toward the end). View from the peak is great, and the wind at the top offers a nice respite from the Simi Valley heat. You can also sign a trail log at the peak. Dogs will be fine for most of the hike, but will struggle with the final approach.', 'Great moderate workout on paved road above Chatsworth. Partly scenery of the city below.', 'This is a good moderate steady uphill climb with great views of Simi Valley and the San Fernando Valley. Just note that when you get to the first fork, head left rather than right to continue up the trail. I had veered right and there are a few scrambly climbs and a viewpoint and beautiful plateau like area with wildflowers, but to continue the trail, go left.There were a surprising number of people on the trail for a weekday evening and everyone was quite friendly and seemed like experienced because no one seemed taxed.I started the hike in the evening around 6.20 and wanted to get back before dark so I did not make it all the way to the top, so I definitely am coming back.

It’s awesome being able to see both sides of the mountain.

You can even see the ocean and the islands on a clear day!! Be prepared with a LOT of water and for a pretty long and slightly strenuous  hike if you're casual hikers like myself and my boyfriend.

The sand and dirt in the eyes make it hard to enjoy the views, so bring shades just in case. It's a tough first start but gets easy after the first 3/4 mile. It can get confusing if it's your first time, as it was mine. The trail opens up atop the first mountain with multiple trails leading different paths. I started a small cairn that will direct new hikers  to the right path (pictured in gallery), hope this helps. I would like to see a taller cairn next time I visit this trail, so please contribute to the cairn as you hike by it. It's a great place to have a small bite when you reach the peak of the mountain.

Ive done it both directions now and while clockwise is “easier,” I find counter-clockwise to be more rewarding because the peaks are kind of the highlight after the long ascent then you have the reservoir and caves as icing on the top, making the trek feel “worth it.” Can’t go wrong either way - it’s a great leg workout & challenging cardiovascularly, but very doable even if you need frequent breathers. Yesterday we were strapped for time to get back to the shuttle by 4pm so if you’re in a hurry, you can finish in 2hr30mins but I recommend to take it slower. Like everyone else said, take plenty of water & a snack if you wish to hangout at the beautiful peaks. There a bathroom, lots of places to sit and chill, and a ranger toward the evenings to make sure you end on the correct side of the park. I highly recommend this trail! But if you want a shorter trail that also gets the peaks, the Juniper Canyon Loop from the west entrance is a nice option, about 4 miles.', 'This is one of my favourite trails in California, the loop takes me about 2 hours. 1:40 if I hustle, 2:20 if I take a break. The steep and narrows are super fun but do require maneuvering and a little scramble. Restrooms about 3 miles in. Beautiful views. Great in twilight. I prefer counter clockwise.', 'Amazing view along the way', 'Did this trail after the rain and had some pretty stunning misty views. Went counter clockwise and really enjoyed, I found it to be a nice ascent with a gentle decline after finishing the steep and narrow segment. Saw three condors in flight at he highest points (prior to the picnic trail fork) which was spectacular. Made frequent stops and still finished in 4 hours. Probably one of my favorite hikes.', 'Arrived later in the day (around 2pm) as the early birds were starting to leave so I scored a parking spot at Bear Gulch. The ranger at headquarters recommended doing this loop clockwise since that makes most of the steep & narrow parts be ascents (nicer on the knees) -- I listened to her and it was a pretty easy hike! Took me 2h15 to complete -- I only stopped a couple of times for water & picture taking. Lovely rainbow views on the high peaks trail thanks to light rain. Considering it was a holiday Saturday, not many others on the trail until I got to the condor overlook.', 'Great hike. Spectacular views. Take this loop counter clockwise and add Bear Gulch caves/reservoir to get the full Pinnacles experience. Don\'t forget to look up often for condors. This should be ""moderate"" instead of ""hard"" as far as Alltrails ratings go. Expect 4-6hrs total time.', 'We walked this trail, including Bear Gulch Cave/Reservoir trails and it totalled 18.5kms. A beautiful day out. It took 6 hrs but we stopped for 30 minutes for lunch and 15 minutes watching Condors and several minutes chatting, so 5 hrs walking time say. This park is so different after Yosemite and Sequoia but still beautiful! We drank 2 litres each but it was November and 22C as a high. The tight narrow part was no problem for my wife, who hates steep drop offs. A very good trail with cut steps and hand rails.Highly recommend.', 'Great hike. Did it in CCW direction and took the spur at the end to the reservoir. Tried to do caves on way back to car but chickened out. I’m 6’4” and claustrophobic. Thankfully there was an obvious bypass trail close by to go around caves!', ""A lovely hike. We came in mid-June and, originally, thought that we'd do the whole loop, continuing along the High Peaks Trail. By around noon, however, the hot weather started to get to us, so we decided to call it a day and hike down through the Condor Gulch instead.\nFor how short this loop is, it really does offer an outstanding taste of what Pinnacles are all about - lovely views most of the way and we even saw 4 condors - one soaring overhead and three sitting in a gulch in the Condor Gulch.\nHighly recommended!"", 'Great little unique trail. Pack enough water. And be prepared to scramble on rocks through narrow trail.', 'Really awesome trail! Well maintained and not as strenuous as expected. I stopped multiple times for ten plus minutes and still made the loop in less than five hours. Great trail!', 'Very good trail.  Awesome views and narrow trail section that makes you pay attention to your footing.  Makes you feel like your rock climbing to a point.  Overall the trail is smooth and not too steep.  Usually crowded during peak times.  I would stay away in the summer it gets way too hot.  Best in spring when the flowers are plentiful. Be sure to stop along the way and soak up the views.', 'Did this hike in the direction shown on All Trails and I thought it was nice for this time of year (Oct). Not too hot in Condor and i liked the direction we took up the steps and down the switchbacks. Views were amazing. Fun times with the carved steps and rails with my 5-year old. Saw two tarantulas and three condors. Nice day.', 'Moderate hike with very beautiful views. Go through the bear Gulch caves for bonus experience. It is not shown in this all trails map.', ""High Peaks Condor Gulch Trail parking at Bear Gulch area then onto Bear Gulch Trail thru caves, and then onto the high peaks can be an e moderate hike depending on conditions, and the views are spectacular of the surrounding hills and valleys.  This hike of High Peaks Condor Gulch Trail in Pinnacles National Park is well worth doing, great all year long.  This video was shot on the relatively wide trail of Eastern side of the Peaks, so very little of both ticks and Poison oak as hazards if you don't get too close to the sides or go off trail.  Lots of wildlife if you look for it. It was very hot, so carry lots of water.

It was 94 when we went and it was probably like 104 up by the rocks. Bring a good amount of water. I brought 2 liters and drank every drop of it. All of it was worth it. But in the heat it is hard.

We loved it."", ""Lots of foot traffic but doesn't distract from the beauty"", 'Very beautiful, very hot.

They joined my son and I who had hiked this trail back in the Spring.  We all left San Jose at 6:30 am to try and beat the heat.  We were on the trail at roughly 8:30 am with plenty of water, cooling towels, and provisions. \n\nWe added the hike to the caves so my daughter could experience it, but hadn't seen that they were closed.  We were shunted around to the reservoir.  We charged our cooling towels in the reservoir and headed up the high peaks.\n\nAs we were expecting, it was warming up as the day wore on, but it was comfortable.  There was occasional shade and we stopped for breathers.  We made it to the bench in about 2 hours.  We stopped and ate our snacks and enjoyed the view.  We saw a few other hikers although more coming from the opposite direction.\n\nWe continued the high peaks.  Saw some birds that may have been condors.  No bird experts in our group\n\nAs we worked our way down, the temperature rapidly rose and our towels were losing their cooling ability.\n\nIt's a long, dry, steep hike back down to the cars on Condor Gultch Trail.  The scenery is gorgeous, though, and well worth it.\n\nWe got back to the car, exhausted.  It was about 12:30 pm when we arrived.\n\nEveryone loved the hike.  What really surprised me was how many people we passed heading up as we were coming down and the heat was rising.  Very impressed.\n\nWe stopped at the park store on the way out and enjoyed some cool drinks.

And it is easier to start clock-wise than climbing up from the Condor Gulch Trail.', ""This trail has everything - incline, a bit of rock climbing, if you extend 1 mile to see the reservoir then you'll get to hike through caves  too. There's no shade for most part of the trail so wear a hat and bring lots of water. Go early too for a chance to see the condors.

We went and had cloud coverage the entire hike so it helped but I can imagine in the sun it would very warm. Saw condors at the end after looping through the reservoir area.I don’t consider myself an advanced hiker and did this no problem. Yes it has elevation up with first 2 miles or so but take breaks and it is absolutely doable. I was concerned because of the rating but nailed it!', 'Very pretty. Bring lots of water, I went through 3L', 'Very nice hike! We first actually started at Moses Rim Trail-Bear Gulch and went through the caves through the reservoir, making the hike 6 miles, then went up on High Peaks trail, down to Condor Gulch and down. Their is a spectacular vista on Condor Gulch where Condors love to show off.', 'Awesome hike!  Great views sufficiently challenging. Walking from the overflow lot adds about 6 miles and going through Bear Gulch to get there is a nice start.', 'The incline starts as soon as you get on the trail, but it’s very doable if you take breaks going up.  I started around 8:30am so the sun wasn’t bad on the way up.  Great views and rock faces towards the top.  Bring a ton of water!', 'Loved it. Lots of vertical.', 'This trail gave me more than I expected. It was a great workout along with some stunning views. Not too difficult but be aware of the heat. We started this hike pretty late, 2-230pm, so the sun was really beating on us. However, that did not take away from the enjoyment. Added the cave trail which made it even a better loop! I will definitely recommend this trail/Park. See ya soon Pinnacles!', 'Started at approx 11:30 - ranger suggested going up Condor Gulch & coming back down High Peaks. Only saw 2 other people on the way up. At the peak we found a place to sit & have a snack (approx 2 Miles in) and we were surrounded by condor who were perched or flying very close to us. Ran into a few groups coming up the opposite direction as we began our descent. Back at the car by 2:30. Not much shade on Condor Gulch Trail, but lots on the way down. Admission to the park was $25.  Fully recommend!', 'We got a little bit of everything in this loop, got to walk through a zing caves and see six condors.', ""We did the loop clock-wise starting at the Bear Gulch area. It was a demanding yet fulfilling hike. Saw plenty of condors. If you can't find a parking spot in the Bear Gulch trail -head parking lot and you hope to do the hike between 10am and 5pm on a weekend, then there is a free shuttle service between the Visitor Centre and the above said trail-head. We used that."", 'Awesome hiking trail!', 'Great hike and got the a chance to see a California Condor.', 'This hike is the best in Pinnacles National Park!! Awesome views and great chance to see Condors!!', 'Worth the hard incline for the views at the top! Loved the narrow peaks part of the trail with the rocks that had holes for your feet carved in to climb up and around the rocks & the single railing ledges! Definitely for the more adventurous hiker!', ""Great hike. Due to overcast skies, we didn't see any condors and the Peaks were obscured a bit, but still a nice hike. Will more than likely go again in order to get a true view of everything."", ""The rock formations are so fascinating and the condors are so majestic if you get to see them! We learned that January and February is when you will see more of them in the park. We got there very early and parked at the Bear Gulch area upper parking lot. We went clockwise and didn't find the Steep and Narrows section to be that difficult going down (all in all, took us about 3.5 hours). It will definitely get your heart rate up, but the views are stunning."", 'Beautiful hike! Saw three condors and lots of other birds.', 'The steep and narrow part is for real steep and narrow. If you have young children or any mobility issues this hike may not be for you. The views are truly stunning and even though it is only 4 miles it feels like a hearty hike. Highly recommended, bring your cameras.', 'Loved this trail. Saw 2 condors! It is steep but not bad.', 'One of my favorite hikes! Went on Thanksgiving weekend with my sisters. Had no clue how cool the pinnacles were. We started on the condor gulch trail side which was an uphill workout all the way to the high peaks. We had lunch on one of the rocks at the steep and narrows section overlook and saw 3 California condors flying together. Awesome day and great exercise.', 'Amazing views and actual condors loitering over the Gulch. The ""high and narrow"" section lives up to the name, with some near-vertical stone steps. The actual trail surface is pretty smooth though, and easy to traverse. Lots of switchbacks help with the elevation.', 'Great hike with awesome views! I did this in the counterclockwise direction. The high peaks section is beautiful and the cut outs in the rock are a fun addition. It’s definitely a moderate hike, though.', 'What a great trail! Alot of uphill but well worth the effort!', 'Great trail. The steep and narrow portion is fun. Condors perching and flying. Hike early as very little shade. We finished at 11 am and park rangers were already discouraging individuals from starting the trail at that time because of the heat even thought it was October.', 'Great hike! Perfect for hiking in winter:-)', 'Great hike', 'Great hike to condors and views', 'This was an amazing hike all around. As others have stated, be sure to bring plenty of water during summer months. This hike is definitely a workout, but the views are phenomenal. Pictures do not do this place justice. We went on a Friday and once we climbed closer to the peaks, we rarely saw other people. We saw quite a few condors up close once we made it to the top. I would suggest hiking this one on a week day if possible as I hear it can get busy on weekends.', ""Great little trail. We enjoyed the views. This would be a fun trail for families. Unfortunately we didn't see any condors but had a great time anyway. We would like to come back and stay at the park a few nights to hike more of the trails and check out some of the rock climbing. And of course, see condors!"", ""Difficult hike if you have foot problems like me, it didn't stop me though! It was very rewarding and I loved the High Peak view. Take plenty of water and snacks. You'll need it! Always check the weather! It gets extremely steep once you start to get closer to the High Peak because of the staircase. Not good for those who have fear of heights but no worries! They have railings for you to hold on. :P Great view of the National Park once you reach to the top."", 'Love the hike - hard to find anything like this near the bay.  Easy to find trailhead however the last 30 minutes will drive you crazy on the country roads. Was on the trail early (830) & parking lot filling up.  The first 2 miles is straight up but with great views.  Even though we have had a lot of rain this winter, trail was bone drive. Nota tone of people the first 90 minutes. For first timers there are a few places that unnerve you once you get to high peaks - couple places there are actual iron rails to protect/help you (see pictures) but amazing views at the top and 2 different condors. Near the bottom, took the Rim Trail to the reservoir - not much there and super crowded,  I would pass next time. Bring a lot of water and sunscreen,', 'We thoroughly enjoyed our hike on the Condor Gulch Trail. We saw 2 Condors and many turkey vultures. The scenery is amazing! You MUST get here early! Very limited parking', 'One of my top 5 favorite hikes in central California.', ""This trail was amazing.  It is definitely a workout, but the experience and vistas are well worth the effort. We hiked this trail in November.  It felt private even though we saw maybe 20 other people.  This hike begins across the street from the Nature Center at the Bear Gulch Day Use Area.  It is a loop, marked by a bench and a vault toilet in the middle (nestled in the high peaks).  Be advised there is no water here. The right side of the loop (via Condor Gulch Overlook) is the more technically challenging side with steep stairs that you have to navigate alongside cliffs.  The left side is just a trail.  Both are steep.  However families with young children might find it easier to just go up and down on the left side (which is what we saw many people doing). We did the loop in the counterclockwise direction as it was easier to navigate going up on the difficult portion than going down.  About 1 mile into it you'll encounter Condor Gulch Overlook.  You might see some condors flying overhead but keep going.  The views from the top are beyond compare.  About 1.7 miles up you intersect the famous High Peaks Trail - take that route.  It'll lead you around the Peaks to the vista in the middle by the bench.  As mentioned there are some difficult bits but it is manageable.  Bring lots of water, a snack, a jacket for the higher elevations, and hiking poles.  Using a single pole make navigating the stairs much easier.This was one of my most favorite hikes I have ever done.  The experience was amazing topped off with seeing 6 condors.  It is definitely a not to be missed experience at Pinnacles."", ""Great!  I didn't expect the scenery. We also were lucky to see some condors!"", ""I've gone twice. Love the views of the fog. It's best to start earlier in morning. You can make it around the park by mid-afternoon and still have the rest of the day. Bring plenty of water in the summer. If you've got a camelbak pack, you're golden. Can't wait to go, again!"", 'breathtaking.  make sure you bring enough water', 'Several years ago, I visited the park from its West entrance; this time, I drove to East Pinnacles from King City. Arriving shortly after 7AM, I deposited the Day Use Fee ($10) at the Visitor Center (closed, but the standard self-pay ""park fee envelopes"" dispensers were available. From there I drove to the Bear Gulch area upper parking lot. This parking lot only accommodates about 12 cars. If you arrive later, you will likely park at the lower parking lot (the two lost are just about .25 miles apart anyway).\n\nI had hoped for a longer hike (larger loop starting from parking lot, to High Peaks, down to ""Old Pinnacles"" area and back to parking lot (10+ miles) but I was breaking new shoes and decided to switch to the shorter loop, taking the 1.7 miles spur trail when coming down from High Peak, to rejoin the parking lot. All told ,about 5.25 miles.\n\nFor a relatively short, hike, this route has much to offer, starting of course with the amazing rock formations the parks get its name from. I am not a climber but it is clear that this is prime rock climbing territory as well. The park is home to a large population of California Condors. When I got to the High Peaks section of the trail around 9:30 AM, it was a gift to see about of dozen of them perched on rocks below me, surveying the valley below and observing a couple of their fellow condors gliding on the thermal currents.\n\nThe 5+ miles loop also provides a non-negligible workout (at least for older folks like me). It pretty much goes all up from the parking lop to the High Peaks, through many a short tight switchbacks. The trail is however well cut and well maintained. The highest section is where the metal railings and steps cut in the rock face trace a root through the peaks. Sure footing and a little bit of agility does help manage that section. Sharing that porting of the trail with many others could also result in a few short retreats as there are many ""one lane"" sections to negotiate.\n\nThe trail is clearly popular and probably heavily used by late morning on weekend (I crossed path with several large parties on my way back down). Having started early, I had the whole trail pretty much to myself; I only met a young couple at the very top. There are many picnic spots along the short trail joining the two Bear Gulch parking lot. Could be a nice spot to sit down and relax, stretch before getting back on the road.\n\nThe visitor center building also holds a Camping store (several campgrounds nearby). If you realize you have forgotten something (sunscreen, canteen, hat, etc.) you may want to get it there.', 'Awesome trail. Great sites. It will definitely tire you out but the rock formations are pretty awe-inspiring.', ""Did this trail on Sat 6 June at 4:30pm.  Weather was cooling down & was perfect.  Fairly steep ascent but easily done on foot with cutout steps in the rock & metal handrails.  I'd rate this moderate at worst unless you are in your 70's, in which any hike requires a bit more planning.  Midday heat in summer is likely to be the biggest concern; you must carry your own water.  Beautiful & fun hike; got a close up view of a condor as a bonus!"", ""This place is awesome.  Super clean park.  The east entrance is best because you can go really early.  The high peaks are super cool.  The hike up changes many times so it's like you're doing multiple hikes in one.  The hike is moderate.  There is a decent elevation climb but worth it.  The caves are really cool."", ""Love love love this place. I've hiked it 4 times in the last 60 days. Never disappointed. The rocks are uncharacteristic of any terrain in the area. There are many trail options and they are all breathtaking. I'll be doing a lot more hiking here."", 'Great hike to get views of surrounding hills and maybe condors. Connect to high peaks trail for a 5.1 mile loop.', 'Dogs are not, in fact, allowed on this trail! This trail is inside the Park and dogs are never allowed on Park trails. I drove here hoping to do a nice sunny hike with my dogs in January, and was quite disappointed to see the ""No dogs allowed"" sign at the trailhead. The good news is that the Park entrance fee is only $5!', ""Very fun trail! I've grown up hiking this trail on a regular basis :) \nGreat to go with the family - but it can be a bit of a challenge. \ngreat for Dogs, my brothers have gone a dawn - running up to beat the sun, and running down to get to school on time. Yes 5! Enjoy!"", ""We did this trail just this past weekend. We wanted to take this trail to the high peaks trail so we wouldn't have to do the longer high peaks loop by itself since we didn't get an early enough start.  At around 10:30am it was already pretty warm and by midday it was probably in the mid 90s, which made this uphill hike to the high peaks trail quite difficult. Once we got to the high peaks trail, it was much flatter and more downhill than uphill so it was definitely much easier. The view was much better once we reached that point. There was even a bathroom on the trail for visitor convenience. All in all, this trail and the high peaks trail down to the bear gulch caves area took about 4 to 4.5 hours so I would definitely suggest starting it earlier in the morning to avoid as much heat as possible. Also if you hike during summer or fall months remember to bring lots of water (at least 2-3 liters per person) and sunblock!"", ""We began this Pinnacles National Monument hike from the Bear Gulch day use area.  The elevation gain is only about 541feet.  Total elevation above sea level is 1800.  It's an easy, path up to an overlook point with a great view of the Pinnacles Formation. It's also an easy way to see some of the sights in the park, with the option to connect to the High Peaks Trail loop and continue your journey.  We saw over 6 condors.  We stayed overnight at the campground, so from there a day use shuttle service is available.  Summer months would be uncomfortably warm/hot.  I would recommend late spring. After the rains when you can enjoy the green hills and plants in bloom.

It took us a total of about 4 hrs (both up and down the mountain). The view was breath taking, definitely worth it - I can’t wait to do it again once there’s snow! If you have 4WD, there’s a service road you can take that will get you 3/4 the way up the mountain (which would cut out about 2 hrs of the hike)!', ""I've done this hike twice in the last few years and the one thing I hate is that hike it a tad bit longer then main article here indicates.  From top to bottom, this is at least 5 mile each way hike.  The first I attempted it, I did it too late in the day and made it up about 4/5th of the way, but turned around as I was running out of water and light (no flashlight on me).  The second time around I left early in the day and made it up in the early mid afternoon.  The views are some of the very best.  On the downside, their were I think 3-4 fires going on in that region so the views were also kind of spoiled too by a bit of haze.   Oh well.  Maybe next time?"", 'Uphill hike all the way to the tower but sooo worth it for the views. It was extremely windy, and that made the shaded areas chilly. My dog did great on the hike up but once we hit the stairs to the tower, I felt is was extremely unsafe for her. We made it up to the third set of stairs with me white knuckling my grip on her harness before I had a bit of anxiety at the sketchiness of the stairs and then decided to carry her back down. The stairs are somewhat wide gapped with absolutely no protection around the side rails and it is a sheer drop down. My friend ended up staying with my pup so I could make it to the top by myself. And I did, but with shaky knees to be honest. If you’re afraid of heights, skip the tower itself. But the view from the tower itself is breathtaking !!!!!', ""amazing hike...the views from the tower are just beautiful.  steady climb to get there but not to bad. i would say depending on your dog whether it would be comfortable for them or not up the stairs. mine made it fine but i held her harness to help her. this has to be my favorite hike for the views alone. can't wait to do it again."", 'Beautiful vistas, especially from the top of the fire tower! A steady climb the whole way up, but not horrible. We even had a very light snow shower on the way back down. One of my new favorite hikes!', 'Beautiful hike. Wouldn’t recommend bringing big dogs, the stairs are pretty sketchy for them to get up. Uphill the whole way but it goes by quick. Great views.', ""9/15/2018: Our group including 5 adults and 3 kids (ages about 5-11) all wearing regular shoes, made the trip up and back with time to stop for lunch and views in about 5 hours.  It was a stunning day to be outside as it was nice and brisk but sunny.  Bring a windbreaker though- it was downright COLD with the wind up near the top and out of the tree line. \nSide note: It's been several days since our hike and my calves are still barking!  As others said, it isn't overly steep, but it'll still get ya!  \nWe'll definitely be headed back! (I heard the flowers are lovely mid-summer!)"", 'Great hike! The stairs to the lookout are not for the vertigo challenged folk!', 'Beautiful views even with the smoke in valley. Took my dog and she had a great time until she got to the steps. She did the first two sets but the third set she could see the valley below, they were steeper/ narrower than the others so we turned around at this point. Stunning views!!', 'Amazing views! I would rate this hike as hard instead of moderate   Start early it gets hot.', 'Great trail and great views. I took about 6 hours, but I like to stop and take lots of pictures! Definitely wish I had hiking poles for this hike since there was a good incline/decline! My Fitbit had me clocked at 7 miles round trip! Not a bad day!!', 'I’ve hiked this trail almost every year since middle/high school. Absolutely breathtaking views at the top with incredible (and diverse!) scenery along the way.', 'Great hike, definitely a little work out but amazing views at the top of the fire look out.', 'This hike is awesome and makes you feel so accomplished but it is a little harder than “moderate”, especially on a hot day. The first half is entirely inclined and not mildly. Make sure to bring a LOT of water and food. You won’t pass any lakes so if you have dogs make sure to pack lots of extra water for them. It is a dog friendly trail though, and my active dog loved it. The view at the lookout is truly spectacular and makes the whole hike worth it. I’d say it took us around 4 hours to complete from the lookout trailhead.', ""Stellar scenery on the way up and fantastic views at the lookout. Can't wait to do this again."", 'Awesome 360 degrees views. Will be back!', 'Finally did the hike today. Such amazing views and what a workout! All the sweat is paid off when you make it to the tower.', ""Great trail with some serious rewarding views all throughout the hike. But really brutal trail. It's a fairly steady steep incline that wears you down. We had to take frequent breaks despite being weekend hikers."", ""Great hike! Easy to follow and views galore! Don't forget the sunscreen at this high elevation. Will definitely do again❤️"", 'Pretty cool hike. Dog didn’t want to go up the steps though', 'I accidentally followed one of the atv trails on the way back down and got off trail a bit but the AllTrails map got me back on track. Amazing views at the lookout', 'Great trail- good workout, mostly up and downhill, lots of variety. Shade in most parts of the trail, pretty windy at the top, so I was glad to have my puffy jacket. Follow the app directions to the trailhead, not your gps, which may lead you onto some rough OHV roads. Don’t count on cell service anywhere in the area. Saw Lassen in the distance from the fire lookout!', 'Why does the All-Trails Map look so different than Google Maps? It looks like the trailhead is off Butcher Ranch Rd. But you can hardly see it on All Trails Map.', 'Must do', ""I did this trail 5/28 it still a little snow on top. but it's possible to reach. lookout was open on this time. very windy! Amazing hike!"", 'One of the most scenically impressive trails in the Sierra. A must do. Trail had plenty of snow still but was easily passable.', 'What a wonderful view!  My wife and I did this day hike back in the early 1990’s and it was definitely worth it.  Lots of wildflowers and bees....would recommend bringing 2 liters of water because there are no real sources to get  water up there.  The final section to top is  completely exposed.  The push up to the very top uses a staircase that leads directly to fire lookout.  The stairs have an open view below....(not for people afraid of heights). There was a fire burning that day over by Truckee, but far enough away to not abstract our view.  It turned out to be a pretty big fire and burned  through the entire corridor around int. 80.', ""Amazing hike. Covered in snow right now. Yak tracks might be best option for walking on snow that is more like ice in parts. Needs 4 wheel drive to get up to butcher pass rd then we walked up to trailhead. Didn't make it to the top as we started our hike around 1pm. Knowing what we know now we'd probably try to aim to start the trail no later than 10am."", ""i didn't reach the top but it was still an amazing hike. there was a lot of snow on the road preventing my car from getting to the Butte trailhead so I used the packer saddle trail.  the trail is fairly difficult to surpass right now as there is snow with ice under it.  the easiest way is the long way by talking the service road to the rec vehicle trail.  i had to turn around by the time i found it but I'll be back!"", 'Great hike! Super hard on the way up and the lookout is cool but terrifying!', 'Great hike beautiful views, didn’t care much for having mountain bikers on the trail, seems they will damage the trail. Also makes it more hazardous for hikers and dogs.', 'Incredible hike with gorgeous views. It snowed a few days before we went so the trail was a bit muddy. The fire tower is pretty awesome although it can be a challenge for those with a fear of heights.', 'Beautiful hike.  Well travelled for good reason.  Head out early to avoid crowds. The fire tower is simply breathtaking.', 'A little steeper than I expected but very worth the hike took us 3 hours round trip as we took quite a few breaks. the end staircase to the lookout is definitely not for anyone afraid of heights at there is about 1000 foot drop underneath the stairs! great hike though!', ""One of the best hikes I've ever done. View is worth every step uphill! A moderate 2hr out and back. Bring your camera."", ""The Sierra Buttes lookout trail was beautiful. My 8 year old struggled for the first mile having a hard time with the steepness. Even he would say it was worth it once we reached the top. The stairs made me nervous although my boys didn't seem to mind."", 'Such a beautiful hike!', 'My goodness!', 'It was harder at the top but the hike was worth the view.', ""Amazing hike with gorgeous views. Starts off very steep, so be ready to ascend almost 2000 ft. Lots of shade in the morning, but much less on the way down in the afternoon hours. Be sure to pack plenty of snacks and water. Enjoy! It's worth the trek."", 'Amazing view of The Valley below, plenty of shade on the way up.', 'Well worth it.', 'Phew!!! That was a lot of uphill. But totally worth every breath stealing, thigh burning step!', 'The road there was s a bit long for me. When I arrived I saw this little forest fire watch tower on top of the nearest peak and thought the hike must stop somewhere short of that far away place; but as the hike progressed I saw that indeed that peak is a mere 2.5 miles from the parking lot. It looks so much more daunting that it actually is, though the hike is quite steep in certain spots so gets the blood moving a bit. (All the better.) I certainly would call it unusually steep however. I was surprised at how quickly the walk was done. At the top, that stairway surprised me by taking my breath away. Apparently I can fear heights under visually bracing situations. The tower is seriously perched on quite a precipice, and those stairs seem to put my body up where it was never meant to be. Ha. Very much worth it though. A bit of terror is good for the soul. Ha', 'Wow this is quite an amazing trail!  The top of the lookout point affords the most stunning views- I quite recommend this trail to everyone.\n\nI think the directions to the trailhead need to be a bit updated- you should see signs for the Pacific Crest Trail at the trailhead as well.  We actually started at the Tamarack Lakes trailhead and eventually connected to the Sierra Buttes trail, but it added a few extra miles to our trip.', ""7/3/17 on the trail by 9-ish... i met only 3 folks going up and had the watchtower to myself for 30 minutes... still snow around and its an easy trail up... i came down too far west out of the snow, followed the PCT the wrong direction for a bit and ended up bushwacking down to a FS road... walked it back NE to the parking area... i added about a mile to my hike... not sure exactly where i erred... i assume some folks access the area from the PCT and i followed the wrong tracks in the snow... some of the beat views i've ever seen in the Sierras... from Lassen Volcano to Donnèr Pass... highly recommend but it was busy around the 4th holiday as i headed down, 20 folks heading up"", 'Great hike. I did it off season, on a weekday so there was no one on the trail but myself, loved that. The views on the top are great. You can see Lassen peak easily.', ""Wow this was one of the best hikes we have done in a while. Only comparable to Mt Tallac. Amazing 360 panoramic views. Beautiful clear day. Even on a 4th July weekend fairly mild traffic. It takes some time to drive too but very scenic one that worth the haul. The roads are a little tricky and you can't really count on the Alltrails to be available so make sure to bring a topo map. Though it's a short hike it feels long because of the challenging uphill climbing and maneuvering through snow to find the trail. DON'T FORGET MAP or good GPS. Just keep heading uphill towards the East you can't miss the lookout. Also you will be following a pretty distinct ridge line to guide you.  Lots of wild flowers too. My 8 year old went all the way to the tower. We saw this couple that was about 80 reach the top, so no excuses! If your afraid of heights don't bother going up the tower. Just make sure to wear good treaded hiking boots and treeking poles to go across snow fields. Once you reach the peak section there's very little snow. We had fun sledding down short hills of snow on our butts on the way back down. Be aware there's a OHV trail and PCT connect with this one, it's easy to wonder off on the wrong trail. Again just stay along the ridge."", 'One of my favorite hikes! Such stunning panoramic views at the top!!', 'Shit was tight my niggas', 'Hiked this trail from tamarack lakes with my dog yesterday. Still lots of snow but melting fast. It was difficult finding the route at times but the last stretch to the lookout is snow free and the views are incredible.', ""6/10/2017 HikeWe were only able to drive up to about 1 mile before the trail head, the road is covered in ice.  We hiked a mile and followed the road but couldn't go further because it's too slippery without proper snow shoes and it's too dangerous with kids.  The ice is hard packed slushy snow.  The views were still breathtaking and that tiny little 1 mile hike was still worth every minute.  We will definitely come back when all the snow is melted, probably in a month or so.  I give this 5 stars even without seeing the lookout!"", 'One of my favorite trails. Love it ❤️', 'I love this area. The sierra buttes lookout is absolutely breathtaking.', 'was awesome in June . fairly easy to follow even with snow.  anyone know about snowshoeing this trail or parts of it in winter months?', ""The lookout is absolutely amazing. I have not hiked this portion of the Sierra Buttes simply because driving straight up the southwestern side is irresistible (if you have a good 4x4, that is)!!  My wife and one of our boys has hiked up to the lookout and they reported the trek to be quite steep. This is a popular and very worthy hike/4x4. It's all about the view."", 'beautiful views, be sure to have jacket!!', 'great hike. ond of a kind. cool stair case up to the fire look out. from Sacramento it felt like a long drive to get to trail head which is up high. the trail is groomed and good condition. moderate challenge and can be enjoyed in half a day. the view is great. i would do it again.', 'Great views, not sure how rates moderate,', ""Really Amazing view. All over. Every time on the way to look about house. Even dow it's very stiff up. Lots of shades."", 'This was one of the most scenic hikes my wife and I have taken. Well worth it.', 'I fell in love ! Great place ..  I started my hiking way down not from the Sierra Trail ..', 'Wonderful hike with stunning views all around!', ""This hike was so much fun! The views are absolutely beautiful! Many places to go off trail to take photos. We took both our dogs, and they both made it. Tied off at the base of the tower, I don't recommend taking your dog up the stairs. Take plenty of water, we did it in about 50 minutes."", 'Great! We took our dog and two 5 year olds. Pack water for your dog as there is none along the way. This hike is all up then all down but the trail is great and not very technical. The views are amazing', 'I love this trail. The panoramic view of the mountains and lakes from the lookout at the top is amazing, and completely worth the steep climb. The trail is part of the PCT,  so if hiking part of the trail is on your to-do list, this is a great section to mark off!', 'You are at the top of a mountain range with spectacular 360 views -- what more should I say.  It is fantastic.  The day we went we were so very lucky as we were the only ones up there for about 30 minutes or more.  Wonderful day.  Air is a bit thinner up there.  Worth the drive!', 'Did this hike over labor day weekend. was a great hike and very well maintained. Great views the entire way up with a spectacular view at the end at the top of the lookout. We had lunch before coming down. Overall a great day. I recommend taking a good amount of water and wear good shoes.', 'Fun, quick hike.  Great views from the top.  Graeagle is nearby for a nice lunch afterwards.', 'Beautiful hike, did it in june, and there was still snow. but recommend the views of the lac were georgeous.', 'This was my first hike I\'ve ever taken.  A fairly large group of us went as a Birthday Hike.  My Husband, I and our 3 children ages 8, 10, 12 did this as our first hike!  It was very tough!  But we managed to make it up.  I would do this again in a heart beat!  I would definitely take it slow and bring lots of water, snacks and good shoes.  We brought only a couple of bottles each and we ran out before we made it the top.  I tripped on some rocks on the way down and tore my ""running"" shoes, and also bounced on my rear once.  I probably looked ridiculous and very amateur, but it was a lot of fun and exciting.  The view is AMAZING no matter what direction you look.', 'Impressive Hike! Stunning Views!', ""love !have done it several times, if you're a hiker this is not the hike to miss! yes there is a lot of climbing, stairs to climb at the end, even with a friend petrified of heights accomplished it proudly. the views are breathtaking! oxygen or lack of, may slow you down if you're a beginner but if you allow the time to take it slow, you'll be so happy you did!"", ""Beautiful scenery......totally worth it. We did it at the end of April 2014 and there was still some snow on the ground but completely navigable. This is a difficult hike, but getting to the lookout (and the way there)  gives you views that are priceless. Pay attention to the way up, it's easy to take the wrong trail down (as we did, and added a couple more miles to our descent). Take enough water and hiking boots."", ""The view from the top is spectacular, however it's all about the journey up.  Many wonderful resting and viewing areas amid changing terrain. The very last leg is barren, windy, rocky and steep (you are on a switch backing jeep trail).  I was thinking where's the Look-out?  Tada! There's the infamous stairs. The trailhead starts at around 6800 feet and ends at 8400.  I definitely felt the difference in my lungs."", 'Very fun hike. Some of the best views around. Fire lookout is very cool and precariously perched on the jagged rocks. We were first up and saw 30+ people on the way down.', ""This is one of the best hikes!  First time I came here was while hiking the PCT in 1986.  Shortly after that I was employed on the Plumas NF and this hike became a frequent one, whether I was walking. running or mountain biking.You can't  go here to many times!"", ""An amazing hike. The trail keeps you on a an awesome ridge almost the entire time, providing beautiful views for miles in almost every direction. The view from the top is pretty incredible. The weather does change fast, make sure you don't get stuck up top, or on the stairs during a thunderstorm. Also, on the way down,  make sure you pay attention & stay on the right path. I took an unintentional detour down the 4WD path & this hike went from about 5 miles, to over 7."", ""Beautiful views on this Hike.  If you want some great views but can't make the hike, there is a 4wd path that takes you about 2/3 of a mile from the top.  After the hike, I tried the 4wd path and made it almost to the top before turning around.  You'll miss the great views of some of the lakes but it is an option.  Well worth the trip.  Lots of people, especially on the weekends, this would be a better hike during the week if you can make it.  :D"", 'The Sierra Butte was well worth the trip! My BF, and I had a great time even though it started raining once we hit the summit. The thunder storms were amazing...even though I was terrified  I continued up the metal staircase, and faced my fears. The view from the summit was worth the fear! The metal staircase was the worst part, only because it was wet.  We took the wrong way at the start of our hike... instead of taking the trail right at by the parking area(the green gate) we walked the road. Bad mistake...a long and steep one once we got off the road. Non the less on the way back we got it right, and the trail was awesome. Alot of wildflowers, and ""Rock Stacks"" from previous hikers. :)  The lakes are beautiful, and cant wait for a trip there next year when it warmer. Great hike for sure!

Good views of rugged desert terrain. Oasis is cool break. Palms are great.', 'lovely go in December', 'Better for trail running than hiking. I took my young two daughters so it was a good challenge for us. No shade until the oasis.', 'I love this trail. It’s very well maintained for being rated moderate. I was disappointed because I didn’t see any water at the oasis but the palms are beautiful there.', 'Very nice trail for running. Some tough points due to elevation but overall it’s fun and safe. The oasis end point is absolutely gorgeous.', ""A lovely, short hike that offers some pretty views along the way and an oasis at the end. \nHaving started with the Ryan Mountain hike in the morning, we only got here at around noon and hiked out at about the same time that everyone else was coming back. As one would expect, it gets really hot in June (110+) but the hike isn't long and the oasis offers some shadow to rest in before heading back, making it doable even in summer. As always when hiking in a desert, just make sure that you carry a lot of water and wear a hat."", 'On the easy side of moderate. Hiked this Memorial Day weekend. Great length for a warm day. Very cool to see the oasis pop up amongst all the rocks. Nice shady spot for a break before heading back to the car. Sad to see tons of people going beyond the sign that marks the sensitive biological area and tells people not to go beyond it. :(', ""great 3 mile total hike. 2 hours, did it at about 8am to make sure we weren't overwhelmed with the heat.  As mentioned by other users, entry is free and parking is readily available."", 'Hiked this trail in Dec 2017 with the hubs and Feb 2018 with our (grown) daughter.  Loved it both times. The trail changes so much it\'s interesting to hike.  I can see why there are warnings to not hike in summer and in heat.  There is pretty much no breeze and were it not ""cold"" (i.e. 45-60 degrees) when we hiked, it would be dangerous. Worth it, but only in the winter.', 'Great and easy hike.', 'Ranger at visitor center commented that this hike is at lower elevation than most other hikes inside the park.  It therefore is hotter.', 'Very scenic hike on Joshua tree.  Ample parking.  Bathroom at trailhead.  Wide well maintained trail. Very enjoyable hike.', 'It was nice. I can recomend it to palm lovers.', ""Great hike! Definitely had me sweating at times but wasn't hard! Agree with another poster--the trail was better than the oasis but I enjoyed it all around!"", 'Terrific short (3.5 miles ft), moderate hike.  Best early AM as trail traffic increases after 10/10:30AM.  Trail is actually more interesting and rewarding than the oasis.', 'Just enough elevation climb and diversity all around was amazing. Kids could go off trail and free climb some boulders. Loved the oasis.', 'Located a little south of Hwy 62 and you can do this hike without paying to enter Joshua Tree National Park.  There was plenty of parking when we were there in February.  There is also a bathroom at the trail head.  It is pretty steep for the first .75 miles of the hike and then you go down and reach the oasis about 1.5 miles from the parking lot and since this is an out and back trail RT is about 3 miles with about 600 ft of elevation gain.  We did it later in the day and it was pretty busy.  Takes about 1-2 hrs to complete.  Some good views and the oasis area with the palms is pretty cool.', 'Fun trail run', 'I thought this trail would be so-so because it’s very popular and heavily trafficked. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised to be wrong. It was our first hike in Joshua Tree and a great choice. The scenery and views are incredible. If you hike fast enough you can get a bit of a workout. The oasis is really cool and there was a ton of water there when we went.', 'Nice hike!! Start early and beat the heat!', 'Nice little hike off the beaten path in j tree. Did it in the morning so the trail was about 50% shaded. In the winter when temps are mild I’d say this hike leans on the easy side of moderate. We did it in a hour and 20 min with a fairly long rest in the oasis. I can imagine it being very challenging in the summer heat.', ""it was ok. the thing we didn't see no wild life at all"", 'We hiked this with a 5 and 10 year old, challenging but doable with kids. Took an hour each way, plus some time to rest and hang out at the oasis. Most is in full sun so better for cooler months but still bring lots of water! Signs indicate people have died here due to heat.', 'Great moderate hike on the edge of Joshua Tree; good exercise without being too strenuous.  The palms at the end really do spring up out of nowhere.', 'My wife and I were staying at Indian Cove Campground and did this trail during our stay. It’s right up the road from the campground. It’s another fun little hike. Clearly defined trail that I’d say is moderate. We did this in December the temperature was around 60. I’d imagine this hike is brutal when it hot. As there is little break from the sun until you get the the oasis. That said, we really enjoyed this one.', 'I just love this hike.', 'The palm trees pop out from no where. Very cool. We were there around 11am so part of them were in the shade, would have been better in the sunlight.', 'Awesome place to hike.', ""Great hike. We did it in 100+ degree temperature weather against park ranger advise. It wasn't that bad - make sure you bring lots of water and make sure you're dressed accordingly with sunscreen. It's brutal if you're not used to hiking.  The Oasis is AMAZING!!!! One of the cooler hikes I've done because it just doesn't quite make sense to have something like that in the desert. Super cool."", 'Beautiful trail with a lovely surprise at the end. Some parts a very vertical but there has been rock steps placed to make it easier. It has a magical way of easing you out of city life in to nature and back the other way.', 'No water in the oasis today. still a pretty hike, very hot so bring water with you', 'awesome trail, lots of water and palm trees, as you can tell by the name, fun to explore, high traffic but totally worth it, great place to have a picnic.', 'At my backdoor. Awesome hiking', 'The hike was through desert the entire way until you reach the oasis. Seeing the palm trees in the distance really gives you motivation to continue the hike, and the end is worth it.', 'Great hike! Best to go early though, for both heat and crowd reasons. Challenging for newbies, but not impossible. Looking forward to hiking this tail again!', ""This was a great hike, but make sure to go in the morning or evening because of the exposure to sun the whole way to the oasis, which is where you'll find the shade. Make sure to bring lots of water! There is an incredible amount of stone stairs to climb and descend on the trail as well."", ""Really cool hike. No water at the oasis on the day we went. Great side mission if you're staying in the J-Tree area."", 'Really nice short hike for early morning or later in the evening. You will be exposed to the sun the entire hike so bring plenty of water! 3 miles out and back took us about 1hr 45 minutes. That is with a lot of stopping for pictures. You may encounter some rattle snakes and lizards. We seen a lot of lizards and one rattle snake.', 'Great trail run! Word the wise because we have friends who\'ve struggled with this trail: aim for spring/fall seasons for hiking if you\'re not used to this weather or trails-- take water and snacks! I read somewhere that it\'s a good idea to head back to the trailhead when your water is half gone.... this trail will be strenuous if you\'re not used to hiking. No shade while hiking, once you get to the ""oasis"" you\'ll find shade. Hydrate for this one especially. Enjoy.', 'Excellent hike. Be careful at the end after descending the steps there is a false trail which takes in the wrong direction but to a dead end. So come back to the steps to take you back on the original trail.', 'The hike goes up at first and has lots of rocks. Also,there are stone steps.The hike has nice views of the hills and snowcap mountains.In the middle of the hike you start getting views of the oasis you are heading to.When you reach the oasis it is very cool and shady.', 'Very fun hike', 'love this trail, great views!', ""The trail itself isn't hard the oasis is really all that makes it worth it. Not very impressed with Joshua tree overall but this oasis was the highlight of our trip and we saw quite a bit of the main park."", 'Better to go earlier in the morning then later in the day when more people are there.  By 10am all the parking spots were taken.', 'Amazing moderate hike to beautiful oasis. The only problem is that since people do not enter through ranger station, a lot of them do not pay.', ""A wonderful hike, but longer than advertised. NPS literature claims the trail is about 3 miles round-trip, but our tracker placed the length at well over 4 miles. NPS also says the trail is moderately challenging, but for some the stairs will be quite challenging.\n\nA generous population of barrel cacti reside along this trail and they shine bright red in the sun - great picture opportunities. I've seen desert tortoises - two different times - on this trail.\n\nBest to do this trail very early in the morning when both the heat and the tourists won't be so overwhelming.\n\nThe oasis at the end is a cool wonder. Sadly, some idiots have carved their names in the bark of the palm trees. It was much worse several years ago, and some of that graffiti is no longer visible, but what is left is very annoying. Always report vandalism."", ""Constantly losing and gaining altitude makes this an awesome workout. In the end you're rewarded with a real oasis in the desert. A unique experience for me. My wife and I really loved it."", ""It's beautiful"", 'we loved it. if you like to climb a little you can always find your own way around. the oasis is visible from far.', 'Fun! But very crowded.', 'Nice hike. Enjoyed the views and the rock formations.', 'Great moderate trail with a strenuous final stretch toward the oasis, which is a beautiful spot: In the middle of June it still had water trickling down a couple of yards and wild blooms. Great for a fine picnic, then a short rest and back up the hill!', 'Not a super pretty hike, but not bad either. Great trail for some exercise.', ""Real shame it's so crowded now. Used to live on Canyon Rd, hiked up there all the time when very few knew about it. Not too rigorous a hike. Our Irish Setter thoroughly enjoyed it. But, that was all back in 1975 too!"", 'Loved this hike.  Getting up over the mountain was a little difficult. Make sure to bring water. The end at the palm trees was a great reward. The trees were agreat resting spot.  There is no cover along the route so wear a hat. The hike was less than 3 miles out and back.', 'Good view', 'Great short trail, lots of hills with semi-steep climbs. Good for a short workout.', ""Great hike. A bit short, but great bang for the buck, so to speak. Be aware that there are a lot of stone steps, some not so necessary. I'm not a big fan of steps where they are not needed and kind of wished that I knew about them beforehand. The oasis is impressive, but access to it is limited due to the fragile ecosystem that it supports. Please don't be like some of the hikers we encountered ignoring the signs and trampling areas that they shouldn't."", ""Well established trail with very high use except during extreme summer heat. Though it's described as easy, I'd say it's actually moderate for those who smoke or rarely hike or those in poor condition because there's a bit more climbing than they usually like. Don't get me wrong, it's easy for regular hikers no doubt. The trail is undulating in many places and does climb quite a bit overall but coming down is easy. This trail is also highly used and as such it's noisy and crowded more than I like. One goes to an oasis in the desert to sit quietly and patiently watching for wildlife coming to sip the life saving waters. I've never got to see anything more than birds or lizards with all the cacophony from inexperienced visitors while at the oasis. The exception is when I visit in the heat of the summer when rarely anyone else goes, and I can sit quietly and occasionally see four legged desert dwellers:-)"", 'It is a great morning hike. Not to crowded . Beautiful at the end. Not much water, maybe by this winter it will be running.', ""Great hike through the desert hills to a fascinating palm oasis. Lots of cacti and desert critters. It get's hot quickly."", 'Gorgeous varied hike.  Can be strenuous at parts on uphills but not too bad.  We did it with kids.  Bring water, and be prepared for beautiful views and the awesome first glimpse of the oasis from afar.  Really unique hike.  The rocky landscape is stunningly beautiful.  We hiked down at sunset, which was lovely.  There was water in the oasis.', 'Not too hard. Took my mom there today and we had a great time seeing the oasis.', 'This is one of my favorite hike in JTNP. It is pretty short, fairly strenuous, but nothing too bad. But the best part is that being one of the few water sources in the park, the wildlife viewing is usually pretty strong. Our last time there we saw a small group of big horn sheep (see photos), including a ram. Keep your eyes peeled on the surrounding hills near the oasis.', 'Nice afternoon hike. Oasis is quiet, not crowded when I was there. Always seems longer than you think.', ""Hiked this with my husband and two boys, ages 5 and 4. I carried our 4yo most of the way up but our 5yo did it all by himself. we enjoyed the scenery, and you can't beat the views. The oasis was very cool. It was a great location for our lunch. There is a steep section of the trail that's uphill on the way back, but otherwise I would even call it relaxing."", ""Worth the hike (moderate) out to the oasis. Lots of bird activity if it's quiet enough. "", 'Great hiking to the Oasis. We were a group of 17, with ages ranging from 4 to 45. Great experience.', 'This trail is probably my most favorite in San Diego County. We saw big horned sheep high on the ridge line. The gem at the end of the trail is worth the hike.', ""Nice morning hike. This is a fairly moderate hike for a beginner. The trail is very easy to follow and well marked. I just started hiking again after many years and it was a decent workout. A couple spots I had to catch by breath due to the stone steps on the way back. But other than that it was easy hoing in both directions. I was hoping to catch a glimpse of some Big Horn Sheep but didn't see any. There was a significant storm that hit the area several days ago so I figured there would be much more water than there was when I got to the oasis. Only a few small puddles. This hike is nice for landscape photography. When I got to the oasis, I sat down and had lunch, explored for about 20 minutes and then headed back. It's about a 3 mile round trip and it took me roughly 2 hours and 15 minutes. I'd like to do it again after I get back into good hiking shape. "", 'This hike completely snuck up on me and surprised me as I did not read the description carefully and had no idea about the Palm Tree oasis at the end of trail. That fact alone made this hike fantastic. The adorable pink cacti dotting the landscape was the other highlight of the trail.  No shade - wear sunscreen, hat, sunglasses.', ""Trail was marked well. For me personally though, there wasn't enough of a pay off at the end of the trail where the oasis was. It was beautiful don't get me wrong, but I think it would have been better if there was more water. The views of the canyon, and the city of 29 Palms below also made this hike enjoyable. Cholla and Barrel Cacti pepper the landscape and was also very nice to see. Nice hike but a bit anti climactic for me."", 'i often bring my marines out here for a good pt session', ""This was a very pleasant hike and it leads to a hidden and secluded oasis. You'll see a few dozen fan palm trees.. The Lost Palms Oasis hike begins at Cottonwood Spring, 6 miles inside the southern park boundary. We did this hike in the spring and it was like paradise...  thumbs up... 5 STAR!!!!"", 'Pretty easy trail, there is a lot of uphill. The trail is clearly marked and once you arrive to the oasis it is totally worth it.  ', 'This was a good trail. The best part is when you reach the turn around point and see how beautiful it is. not to difficult either.', ""I did this immediately after doing the Boy Scout and Indian Cove trails. So, I was a bit tired but figured since I was in the area and it was only three miles, I could do it. It was about 3:30 by the time I got to the parking lot. The lot was about three fourths full, which was a turn off. \n\nThe trail is pretty moderate. I passed lots of families with small kids, even a grand mother who was hiking with a helmet and hiking sticks, but this isn't a hike for folks who might loose their balance.\n\nThere are two pay offs to this hike. \n\nThe first is the Oasis itself. Pretty once you get there. There is even a view of the Mojave Desert Preserve.\n\nThe second payoff is doing this hike later in the day close to sunset. I left the Oasis as soon as the sun passed the ridge. By the time I got to the ridge overlooking Twenty Nine Palms itself, sunset was in full mode, the colors of the sky were amazing pastel pinks, corals, yellows and blues. Bring a flash light in case you stay longer to take in the views."", 'This trail is pretty demanding, but has beautiful views of the mountains and surrounding valleys of the Joshua Tree National Park. The terrain is all mountainous and the trail is littered with rocks and cactus. Watch out for snakes and scorpions, this is their home If you go during the summer, take plenty of water.

Based on  someone's comment below I took the far left trail going up rather than walking up through Caballero Canyon.  The far left trail which doesn't seem to have a name (it's the trail left of Little Hectic) was steep and challenging to be honest.  A bit more than I wanted to do.  Not impossible but it took some work.  I was hoping to hike 6 miles so the plan was to hike up the un-named trail, do the figure 8 at the top, and come down Lower Hectic.  I ran out of light for an unknown trail and came down through Marvin Braude Mulholland Gateway.  The trail to the far right, the one west of Caballero Canyon, is beautiful, not too hard, and fun.  And I highly recommend taking the time to hike out to Farmer's Ridge Trail overlook.  The view of Santa Monica and Catalina was fantastic."", 'Fun for the family.', ""First time on this trail.

Once to the Mulholland Fire Road the views opened up and were spectacular. It was raining slightly ( in July!), so it was really beautiful up there. I could see that the fire roads weave all around those mountains, and I was wishing I had my bike at that point! Anyway, I headed right and got back on a smaller trail that was very steep in sections-glad to have my poles. The trail eventually looped around and came down to the main trail that followed a creek back to Reseda. I plan on exploring all these trails.

The trails along the top of the bluff are well maintained. Some of the trails down to the beach are a little narrow in places. The northern beach is good, but the others are rocky. I do this trail once per week with my dog. Being able to stop at the golf course outdoor grill for lunch is a real plus, and they serve water to dogs if you ask. Heavily trafficked.', 'Loved this trail. Scenic rout along the beach and there are so many option of trails to explore.', 'Trails in Trump golfcourse. Beautiful views down by rock beaches. Waves crashing, multiple trails.', 'Great hike good mix of easy and hard course depending on the routes you take', ""If your looking for a scenic yet relaxing hike, then this is the place to go. I went with a friend and we enjoyed it very much . Nearby parking is at Trumps golf course (it's small lot, but hopefully you can find a spot)"", 'Beautiful place to walk/hike along the ocean! You turn on Trump Nat’l Drive into golf course then hang a left, there’s free parking/no time limit but the lot isn’t huge. There are picnic tables off the greens to chill. You can do the main easy trail (some parts paved) with ocean views or hike one-off steeper trails to the beaches. I hadn’t hiked in years and I was fine with all. Says “No Animals” on beaches (probably just for safety, it’s all rocks) so use your judgement :) I will be going back!', 'It was a bit confusing trying to find where to begin the hike but just walk through the golf course and signs will lead you to the trail. Keep going along the rocks and the trail will continue. I ended up just going along the beach (rocky and sandy) bring sunscreen, a camelback, a sheet to lay on the beach if you want to take a break and enjoy the scenery. Loved it because there was not a lot of people at all and I came on a Sunday afternoon.', 'perfect challenges climbing over rocks for the young kids', 'Gorgeous seashore landscape and few people actually. Almost all the way exposed to sun. No outlet on the east side, you have to get back the same route becuz of private property', ""Great trail, beautiful area. I prefer doing the trips down to the beach on the way in (get them done). On a hotter day this is a great trail to do, great ocean breezes. Unfortunately I accidentally turned my recorder off for 23 minutes so didn't record over a mile of my hike, bummer, at least my fitbit was recording."", 'memorys of childhood all over this place my father who always brought us here even spend the night once super cold but amazing experience glad I had the opportunity to leave my mark and footprints all over this beautiful beach♡ and gorgeous sunsets for in love with this place and thankful to my father who made it happen', 'Very nice scenic trail with options for the whole family. We saw several dolphins near the shore along with rabbits lizards and birds. Easy to medium level trail great for sunrises or sunsets', 'beautiful hike overlooking coast and tide pools, was disappointed to see that all the pathways down to the coast said ""no animals"" I was  .  looking forward to walking my dog on the beach, maybe next time I\'ll just do it because it was empty. aside from that we enjoyed a much shorter hike along the 2 to 3 miles that we could take our dog.', 'Beautiful trails, going down to the beach and back up gives you a good workout, and there are several different places to do this at. I really like that there is a good dirt path next to the paved.', 'Dog-Owners! The main trail here is mostly fine, but some of the side loops off the main trail have cactus lining pretty narrow pathways. Some of the cactus overflows. Mostly observed on the adjacent loops heading up and east, not the side loops heading west to the water.Side note - Dear Admin, If this trail is owned and run by the Palos Verde conservatory, can we change the name on here? Thank you!', 'best hike its my fave we go twice a week..so many ways to hike easy trails tough trails dwn to the ocean trail benchs over looking the ocean to have lunch on..', 'Amazingly scenic. In fact you need to be careful to watch where you are going you don’t run off the edge of the trail and off a cliff. Lots of hills  so it is quite a good workout Especially if you take The switchback trails down to the beach and back.', 'Beautiful views and great versatility.', 'Great place. Only draw back no shade. None. Bring a hat and water. Windy too so lip balm would be great too. Beautiful ocean views and some inclines. Especially if you go down to the tide pools. I went on a Sunday and the parking was full when I left. Lot of dogs and most were following the rules and had them leashed. Watch out for bikes. I did not know they allowed them.', 'Amazing views. Not much of cardio. If you want more workout take couple of to the beach and back sub trails.', 'Nice hike from my girlfriends condo down to the beach.  The short, steeper trail down to the beach was a nice workout coming back up.  Weather was perfect today!', 'Beautiful Hike..  Go USA.  Love the American Flag!', 'Went to the Trump Trails for the first time on Sunday morning, & I fell in love with the trails. Beautiful views to relieve some stress. Less crowded in the morning.', 'This trail serves multiple purposes and is great for a walk, run, or hike.  The trail overlooks the ocean and consists of moderate climbs. It also contains various activity levels so you can casually walk or challenge yourself to increase your heart rate.', 'Great trail to run .', 'Nice Moderate hike!', 'Good all around trails. Beach access on a couple trails challenging at most but doable for my 6 year old.  Fun all around great views nice rocky beach.', 'Lots of beautiful trails of the main trail! It was a fun hike and had very challenging potions.', '4 stars for scenery. I recommend an early evening hike to catch the sunset. Trails are rather easy.', 'Nice trail . Nice ascending and descending routes. Beautiful scenery rain really change Things for the better . Will be back for more.', ""The view is amazing. Always so peaceful every time I go. I've definitely become a regular."", ""Started this hike around 11 am on a Tuesday and we only saw a handful of other people. Took a right at the first fork and a right at the second as well. Then walked for about 3 miles on the shore. Definitely need hiking boots or good athletic shoes the rocks aren't stable and move around under your feet. Can easily make this as long or as short of a hike that you want. We walked for about two miles north on the coast and then walked back to the second fork and took the left path. That path is much more steep there are some stairs built into the mountain but they don't make the incline/ decline much easier. Some of the best views in the area. If your lucky you'll see seals we saw plenty of sea life in tide pools."", 'Beautiful views', 'Heavily trafficked but nice views and variety of skill levels with a couple different beach access points. Plenty of free parking near the Trump clubhouse.  There is a nice park with picnic tables near the trailhead by the clubhouse.', ""A great Saturday morning walk. But don't expect solitude, there were lots of people on he trail even at 7am. Good for me and my dogs. We had fun!"", ""I was very pleasantly surprised by this trail. I went on a Friday around midday and I only saw a few people in the 5 or so miles that I did.First of all, the scenery is gorgeous on pretty much every part of it--you are right along the water for a lot of it. Definitely the prettiest hike I've done in PV. Most of it is unpaved except in the area right by the golf course. There isn't much shade, unfortunately, but the coastal breeze helps. Bring water! Second of all, it really is a truly moderate trail. I followed the map almost exactly, and it has its fair share of hills--you'll be going up and down for about half of it but that makes it a nice workout. I didn't go all the way down to the water on every side trail but that would definitely make it more strenuous because of a steep uphill trek on the way back. The golf course also has public restrooms and a free parking lot just for people using the trail (golfers aren't allowed).Would definitely do this one again and recommend it to others!"", 'So beautiful!', ""LOVEEEEE these trails. There's so many different directions to go, somewhat all connecting together. Great work out with Amazing views! Don't knock it because it's TRUMP trails."", 'What a beautiful trail!

Bonus: the best burgers in the clubhouse!!', 'Love these trails with the ocean view and breeze.', 'It was a beautiful trail!', 'Great views. Nice trail down to beach off the cliff.', 'This is a great place to start if your new to hiking. My kids 10 & 11 love it too! Beautiful views everywhere you are on the trails.', 'Free parking and gorgeous views!', 'These trails have good variety, you can go down to the beach or stay on the trails above. Definitely try the killer ""steps"". Parking is free, that\'s always a plus.', 'I love visiting this area, whether it be to hike the trails, visit the dog beach, take photos, explore the tidepools, or simply to just have lunch with an

Less traveled than many routes on Diablo.  We had wind gusts up to 60 mph, which is unusual, but made it more adventurous.  Would strongly recommend for someone who wants a decent workout in a relatively short hike.', ""Just got back into hiking before Thanksgiving and this was a great hike.  Challenging; but, wasn't too overwhelming.  Took a little detour to the observation center to see the view.  That made it worth it.  Clear day and beautiful views.  Was about 34 degrees when we started.  Wore layers.  Should have brought gloves and something to cover my ears; but, wasn't horrible.  Will definitely do this one again!!"", 'Loved this hike. I thought it was more of a hard hike than moderate. The incline was pretty steep.', 'The hike was awesome!!!I hike with my dad,and we had fun with great views.  And if you want to go drive to mountain,you need to pay 10 dollar, but hike was that much worth.', 'Very hot day, hike with my 11year old son. The trail was easy walk with great view. Path was very stable, just fun!', 'This was a great hike... just strenuous enough but not a total killer for one of medium ability... thanks to previous reviewers... it did take 4 hours when you factor in occasional breaks and lunch and a stop to explore visitor center. Thanks also to this app for helping me navigate... made a few wrong turns but was able to quickly correct thanks to gps. The sometimes mediocre signage is why I am only giving 4 stars. Could be greatly improved upon. Bring plenty of water and plan for a work out. I imagine the view can be spectacular but alas it was too smokey when I did the hike to see all that was there.', 'So thankful for all of the shade! Definitely saved me on a hot morning.

There are some steep parts with loose gravel on dirt that I wouldn’t want to do going downhill, so I recommend clockwise. There were so many gorgeous wildflowers! I also saw a coyote. I added on the spur trail to the summit, since I’d never been there.There’s a lot of poison oak. Most of the trail is wide enough that it’s easily avoided, except for the Bald Ridge section. Wear pants and long sleeves! It goes up to shoulder height. Most of the trail is exposed, and it felt warm even though it was under 60 degrees when I started. Wouldn’t want to do this on a hot day. I’ll definitely do it again, though!', 'This was a great hike and a great time of year to do it.\nEverything was still green and blooming.

Views are amazing as you make a full circle around the summit of Mt. Diablo. There are some rather steep sections in this loop.

We parked at the base of the mountain, took a map and started. Obviously it's a mountain so lots of inclines.

We spotted a lot of deer on our way back."", 'Loved this hike, but make sure you have good hiking shoes.

If you do the loop in a clockwise fashion it is more difficult that counterclockwise.  When you do the loop going clockwise be careful once you start the uphill section at Murchio Gap.  It is narrow, steep, and has a lot of loose gravel.  Just before before you get to Prospectors Gap you come to a look out that is a great place to take photos or just enjoy the view.

Some of the steep climbs are pretty rough, so you better be in shape!"", ""I really enjoyed this hike today. I will say, however, this loop trail is very challenging. I started my hike in the Michael Canyon parking lot. The first couple miles is relatively  flat.  But once you get to about mile three, the honeymoon  is over. At this point, there is a significant  incline almost all the way to the top (About 2-3 miles). Coming down the backside of this climb is very tricky...lots of loose gravel,  which makes for some slipping/sliding.  Overall, I would highly  recommend  this trail for anyone who is looking for a good workout. Of you don't  like incline hikes, you definitely  don't  want any part of this hike."", ""I did an extended 18 mile trail run from this starting point. It was 4.5ish miles up to where I turned off onto the Burma Trail for another 5.5 miles then ran/hiked back.  This is not for inexperienced hikers or trail runners because the climbs and descents can be brutal. Layer your clothing too because when you're on the rim paths, the wind can suddenly kick up and it gets cold. Take liquids and food for long runs and hikes because there are no resources on the trail.  Probably the most consistently gorgeous trail run I've done!  Loved the views...even though the climbs were ouchie! LOL!"", ""We did this walk on New Year's Day 2014.  Our group was five people who are reasonably fit (a college athlete, 4 regular runners, etc.) with limited hiking experience.\n\nWe found the terrain slightly challenging but very enjoyable.  The route starts out largely downhill on a wide fire road.  We took a detour on Eagle Peak Trail (just for fun) once we reached Murchio Gap and took another detour down Meridian Ridge before retracing our steps.\n\nDespite poor air quality in the Bay Area on the day of our hike we were rewarded with spectacular views in all directions and a nice afternoon's worth of exercise.\n\nThe hike is definitely worth undertaking but one shouldn't underestimate the need for water and layered clothing as we went from very comfortable warm weather at the start to cold and windy weather near the end after most of our group had worked up a decent sweat."", 'I would rate this hike as difficult due to some very steep sections, but the views are amazing every step of the way and are your reward for taking this hike. \n\nThe drive up is a little scary due to all of the cyclists - with few kick-outs, you have to really be sure before passing or being passed by on the long windy road to the top.\n\nThe Grand Loop took us a bit under 3 hours. We started before 10AM and were practically alone for the first half of the hike. We passed a couple of mountain bikers along the road to Merchio Gap and by the time we got to Summit trail, the parking lot was full and the top of the mountain was crowded. \n\nBring LOTS of water. There is little cover and you will want to stay hydrated for the steep sections. A lot of hikers had poles. If I were to do this trail again, I would use them.', ""Amazing views!\nTough for a novice like me, but worth it at the end.\nMapmyhike app showed 1,400' cumulative climb and 6,075 calorie burn before batteries gave out just under the summit.  \n\nRemember to take lots of water.  Our Camelback style backpack water tanks ran out just under the summit.\n\nEnjoy the views and the work out!"", ""Great day hike! It was listed as a moderate hike but I would say it's more difficult. There are many parts that are very steep going down and up. Watch out for mountain bikers who might be skidding down fast and not see you around corners. Each hiker needs to carry their own water, snacks and have good boots on. Sunscreen is a must because much of it is exposed to direct sunlight. Overall it is well worth the time and effort. Amazing how far around northern California you can see."", 'I hiked it in 107 degree heat, but it was still a nice local hike. Watch out for all the poison oak everywhere. ', 'Very enjoyable hike. Views are incredible, although the sky was a little hazy the day I went. If you can catch a clear the day after a rain storm, it would be stunning.\n\nMost of it was flat to pretty moderate pitch, but there are a few extended sections of some pretty steep pitch. Check the weather, much of the loop is exposed and it will be scorching in the summer.', ""This loop was absolutely gorgeous. However...it was much longer than reviews I've read online. The first 4.5 miles were very easy and scenic. The views were spectacular. Once you start the uphill battle it becomes very difficult. Going downhill was just as treacherous because of the terrain, the loose rock and gravel made the small downhill walks dangerous. I slipped at one point and landed on my rear. I would not consider this moderate. I would say this hike is demanding and for anyone that is not in top physical shape it is absolutely  strenuous. I do no recommend this hike for newbies. If you're a novice I would suggest taking the Juniper trail from the lower summit parking lot down to Juniper campground and maybe up to Eagle Peak and then back. The ridge trail and the summit trail are hell. BUT the vistas were so breathtaking that it is totally worth it for anyone that can manage. Absolutely stunning! "", 'Great hike. Very scenic. I would rate it somewhere between moderate to difficult, because some sections are pretty steep. \n\nSome things to note:\n\n1. The first few sections are flat or even on a downward slope, but the rest of the sections more than compensate for it.\n\n2. It is easy to miss the road that connects point #5 (Murchio Gap) to point #7 (Prospector\'s Gap); we missed it and took a slightly longer route.\n\n3. Pay close attention to the trail at Prospector\'s Gap. There are three roads from there, but the trail continues along the narrowest of them -- as noted in the guide above, follow the signpost that says  ""to summit trail, 1.02 miles"".\n\n4. From Prospector\'s Gap on, the trail is narrow. Watch out for folks on mountain bikes!', 'Greta Hike, I recommend starting at the Summit, not as the guide says at Camp 23. Great Views, Not too hot.', ""I went on this loop with the EveryTrail team last October and had a great time. The views of the bay area from the trail were spectacular--I could even see Mt. Tam and the Sutro tower in San Francisco. \n\nThere were a number of sections along the trail that were exceptionally steep, which would be difficult for younger kids or anyone with knees that don't always cooperate.

Lots of mountain bikes.', 'A good trail, great for beginners as the ascent is easy and not steep. My cousins live right above this canyon so this is a regular for a lot of our family. It’s not my favorite but it’s not my least favorite either. The reason I gave it 3 stars is that it takes a lot of the fun out of it when you constantly have the mountain bikers sneaking up on you and small kids. Little ones are just all over the place and it makes hiking a lot more work than it needs to when you share trails with different activities. I am sure the mountain bikers feel the same about the hikers, especially the kids.', 'I loved this hike! I hiked it with my 9 and 10 year-old kids who also loved it. It was a bit long though...took us 2.5 hours of leisurely hiking. Instead of walking up Awma Road and then onto Aliso Creek trail I’d recommend heading to the left (behind the parking lot) following the stoney path to the left. This path leads to a creek crossing and has a lot of trees and greenery (it’s very picturesque) and leads to Aliso Creek Trail East which is not paved so a bit more of a hike compared to the Aliso Creek Trail.

You walk by an abandoned ranch, lots of beautiful, lush scenery. The journey to the cave is more exciting than the cave itself.', 'Trail is long, but not too difficult. The mountain bikers are ridiculously dangerous to walkers. They think if they ring their little bell you need to immediately jump off the trail for them. It should not be our risk to constantly look behind us to cater to their speeding on the trail. We stuck to the proper side of the trail coming up and down. Caves were great!

You have the option of going to different trails, there's maps along the trail that will guide you and separates the trails by level of difficulty and how long each trail is.  I want to say theres about 20 trails for a total of 10 miles or so.  However, I only went to the Dripping Cave.  It's really nice and there's a bit of history to it.  People on trail are very nice, mostly mountain bikers and few hikers.My companion and I got a late start and arrived at the trail around 3 pm, the start of our trail we saw a coyote and on the way back we saw one 6 ft snake (not a rattler) and heard a pack of coyote/wolves- it'd be a good idea not to travel by yourself or carry pepper spray.  the coverage on the service road isn't too great, hardly any, however, once you reach the actual trail the amount of shade/ coverage does get better."", 'Here is the way to get here.  google this address The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\n28291 Alicia Pkwy\nLaguna Niguel, CA 92677\nYou park in the parking lot across the street for the trails it is paid parking too. If you get luck you can park on the street but NOT in the church.This address is  on Awma and Alicia Parkway in Laguna Niguel. the trial is very easy to find. You walk through the parking lot to the fire road about 1.5 miles (guesstimate)  to the porta potty/gate for closed road and go right follow Wood canyon trail to Dripping Cave which is a left turn (Not Cave Rock which is a small half circle hike back onto Wood Canyon)Dripping cave is actually a short hike direct to the cave you can spice it up by going past Dripping cave  and keep going to Oak Grove and up Car Wreck (which is a single track all the way up and steep, great ass workout) for the ones who like the extreme hiking and follow that all the way to the top where you see homes and when you get to top at the T follow to the right back down Mathis Canyon (which is all downhill and can get pretty slippery and a single track) which will go back down to Wood Canyon and Dripping Cave. Wood Canyon will take you to most of the trail heads. It is beautiful and pretty populated. Lots of mountain bikers so follow road courtesy and walk directional of you will get hit. There are no water stations on the trials so pack lots of water. This was about 3 hours and 4-bottles of water if you follow this route. 72 degrees and it can get dry and hot.

We came to a bushy area with turn offs that lead to nothing! after about an hour we decided to turn around and head back to our car because it was too hot to be lost in the middle of shrubs and sand trails.

i saw a bird.', 'Great short hike.', '1.5 Miles up then 1.5 back down. Definitely grab a map at the trail head before adventuring. You can modify by making hike longer by including the willow trail. Some shade provided. Bring plenty of water. Great views. Watch out for bikers.', 'This trail is maintained & rewarding. All uphill at first but once you reach the top, the trail starts to wind down. So much around to see & explore but also great for running. The run is challenging but as soon as you make the run around into the smaller trails, that’s the exciting part. The trail closes in between trees & a dried up river bed. The trail markers let you know the distance so you don’t get lost.Constant views and open area so wear sunscreen.', 'Awesome trail. Ended up taking it to the emerald trail totaling about 10 miles. Great hike, cool secluded place in Laguna Canyon.', 'The label of the trail compared to the actual trail is not entirely accurate, bomber ridge is along the ridge line and to reach it you have a couple of different trail options. My personal favorite is big bend , a nice incline which is a bit more gradual but still a good bit of work. It is very exposed so wear sunscreen & bring a hat! Especially on a hot day.', ""it is a very refreshing hike. we started by 7 AM. it's steep at the start but gets easier as you go. The address on Google takes you little farther. so I recommend using directions from all trails."", 'Great hike and views. We took Willow up and Laurel Canyon trail back down. Great 3.4 loop. Good mix of difficulty and ease.', 'We did Willow Trail first then headed down Laurel Canyon Trail. Willow Trail is not shaded and all uphill going this direction, so it was pretty difficult for me. I was feeling very out of breath when we made it to the top. Laurel Canyon down was shaded and very beautiful. Definitely enjoyed the second part of the hike more.The parking lot at Willow was full when we arrived so we had to park at the next one down and hike up to the trailhead. Added maybe another mile to our hike.', 'Beautiful views towards the ocean. Very exposed so bring lots of water.', 'Took the shadier way up with the narrower roads which ended up being a great HIIT workout because of the steep inclines followed by flat roads. It was tough but it’s fine if you take breaks. No water through the streams though, but saw the Pacific Ocean. Came down on the windier steeper trail which ended up being an easy decline. Would definitely do again!', 'Great Trail. We started with Willow Trail and came back with Laurel Canyon Trail. Laurel Canyon seemed to be more difficult than Willow.', 'Good canyon single track, no bikes on most of it. Waterfall was dry. Lovely rock and cave formations off limits.', 'More of a walk than I hike. The majority of the “hike” is on a wide road that a car could drive up and there were way more bikers than hikers. Not much in the way of views either. Some cool rock formations were the most interesting thing. I was always waiting for something more. The loop took us about 1.5 hrs. I’m sure it would be much prettier in the Spring with the flowers blooming. This may be one of the better hikes in the area but it only gets 2 stars compared to other hikes I’ve been on around the world.', 'Views aren’t that great. I recommend going when it’s cool out or bring more than enough water! Trail gets very hot only pockets of shade.', '$3 parking fee', 'Nice hike in Laguna Canyon with great scenery. Pay to park.', 'Been hiking this one since I was a kid. Great workout because of the incline and the plant life is beautiful. This is a go to favorite for us!', 'Excellent. Even on a hot day w/o any canopy. Went down Emerald Cyn Rd & up Old Emerald Falls Trail, got lost and went down Moro Ridge Rd rather than go back up to Bommer as I had intended. Was still worth it and what a run. FYI, Old Emerald Falls needs a lot of manicuring(workers were out today doing that) plus a lot of cactuses right up on the edge of this single track. Definitely do not want to MTB this trail as one will definitely end up with many a spike in their legs.', 'Great trail! Have seen a number of snakes on this trail.', 'Quad burner fire road climb to start followed by fun single track downhill through some shady spots!!!', ""Good clean trail with some nice steep hills and decent views. People who are writing bad reviews about this trail probably couldn't handle the hills and the sun lol"", 'trails are open until 7 PM, but gates to the parking lot lock at 5 PM. no other parking nearby either.', ""It was fine. Good beginners' challenge. Looking forward to adding Lizard Trail onto it or Bomner. A bit crowded, but not bad. Again, it was fine."", 'Love the views and love the uphills that keep the momentum going! Wish it was dog friendly, but I understand coyotes are popular in the area and that would make it unsafe for everyone if dogs are around. I highly recommend this trail to anyone that loves a good nature hike!', 'nice trails', 'Beautiful scenery throughout this very diverse trail. The route type changed 3 times; steep, mountainous incline to moderate rocky trail to flat plane. Signage is a bit tricky to follow so this app was very helpful. Great hike', 'Beautiful, partially shaded hike along a creek bed and then along a ridge. Great views. Awesome rock formations. Moderate hill climbs.', 'easy, shady, and relaxing', ""Laurel Canyon, in and out, is one of the few mostly shaded trails in Orange County. Up hill mostly but nothing difficult to climb over. I've seen lots of children on this hike as well. If you stick to the In/out and don't take Bommer-Willow Trail back to the parking lot, you won't run into many mountain bikes, as they're not allowed on Laurel Trail past the Stagecoach Trail cutoff. Keep going on Upper Laurel past Laurel Spur-Bommer Trail and you'll see numerous huge canyon live oaks. Laurel Canyon takes on a completely different character as you come back down."", 'it was great but i believe it is more that 3.4 mile', 'Challenging but fun hike! $3 parking. No dogs. Not much shade at all. Many branching trails making for lots of choices and a full day of hiking :)', 'You are not alone in there!!!! Lots of people and lots of creatures.', ""The uphill hike at the beginning is the hardest part, hang in there, it's worth it! Views are beautiful and nice option if you don't want to go all the way to the end of the 133 for trails closer to the beach."", 'Wonderful trail, very relaxing!', 'Great! Watch out for mountain bikes!', ""This is one of my favorite trails. Absolutely love the challenge at the beginning of the trail. Hiked this trails so many times. Sometimes 3 miles sometimes more. We've walked all the way to Laguna Beach, walked along the beach and back to the start of Willow Trail. I would highly recommend this trail. You have many options to connect onto trails that connect to this trail that could take you all the way over to Pelican if you choose. Hope to do this soon!"", ""It was fun! A friend and I went, and while we don't consider ourselves beginners, we're definitely not at the intermediate level yet-- some parts were a little steep and we took a break. Too dry for any water activity, but you can see where the water once flowed. Great views!"", 'Just have to go to the top to see full views of the ocean. Take the wide trail up, narrow shadier trail down. About 5 miles round trip. It\'s steep going up so for tourists or those not in shape, not ""easy."" I jogged about half. Not crowded, easy to find. No dogs are allowed on any of the Laguna Wilderness trails FYI!  700 acres total, nothing new.', 'A lot of Narrow trails Nice nature walkViews of the 73 and surrounding landscape, no water views', 'Not much shade and indeed pretty steep if you follow Willow trail. I only saw one bike but lots of bike tracks so it must be popular.', 'It was a pretty nice hike', 'Went up the Laurel Canyon side (the fire road) and down the Willow Canyon side (a relief to escape the bikes).  The fire road is indeed steep (and exposed) -- ocean breeze at the top felt really good.  Willow Canyon had delightful flowers and views -- better coming down, I think.  Gnatcatcher flock in the willows at the bottom.  Took this oldtimer more like 3 hrs.', 'Very steep, come prepared for this. Overall great hike. Definitely would recommend to others. Again , love the area.', 'Great hike with beautiful views. It is steep so you will get a great workout. It does get hot so bring lots of water.', 'Great hike with the kids but the first part is very steep and there are tons of bugs, not so easy.\n\nNo waterfall for us but it must be beautiful with water running through the Canyon, we may come back after a good rain. The Willow Canyon trail is large, we can see big rocks and we have a nice view on the Canyon. Then we went down through Laurel which was great, very narrow path in the middle of the trees and bushes with a lot of small rocks and birds.\n\nIt took us 2 hours to complete with 3 kids; 8, 6 and 3 years old. Plus a baby.', 'Did this hike with REI on Saturday.  we did a 4.7 mile section of it. we started out doing the tough uphill first which led us down through the shady part at the end of the day. the first bit (depending on which direction you take) is quite steep (ala Modjeska canyon) for about 1.5 to 2 miles.  once you reach the ridge then you can choose several directions which give you some view of the ocean.  coming down we found a ""No bikes allowed"" narrow path that leads through a shady area adjacent to what would probably be a small river bed had there been any rain this winter.  all in all a wonderful hike.', ""I took the big bend trail up which can get very steep at some points and a little exhausting. When I got to the top of big bend trail I went left onto the boomer ridge trail to the next intersection at which point I took the boat trail all the way out to guana point I think it's called. Got some great pictures of the sunset of three ocean and the rolling hills of laguna. However that came at a cost. No moon tonight means it was super dark on the trail, at around 8:30 I had to break out the flash light on my phone. overall its a great hike with some spectacular views. if you feel up to it try doing a little trail running. Afterwards you will feel accomplished but oh so sore"", 'Beautiful trail with some nice ocean views and vantage points. The trail itself is well kept and there are rangers on duty at the base of the main trailhead. The map location marker is wrong though. You need to take the 133 South and go just pass El Toro, then the trailhead will be on your right. If that parking lot is full, you can drive down another mile to the next one and start on the backside of the trails. Great trail for hiking and biking, I recommend both.', 'I loved this trail but let me tell ya it was long! A friend and I decided we wanted to take this to the beach and even the wilderness man at the beginning warned us it would be a long way! The first part was pretty much all uphill! But we eventually made it and it was great! Definitely go early! I would do it again!', ""I love heading to Laguana Beach and hiking this trail.  For ease in starting out, take the path closest to Rt 133 to begin otherwise you will be hiking up quite an incline rather than descending it at the end.  I've taken my camera and gotten some beautiful photos."", 'Pretty awsome trail that leads you to views of Laguna Beach.  Rolling hills has a few soft sand patches and links to many other trails and single tracks.', 'This is a pretty easy hike, unless you are a brand new hiker.  The first few times, I had difficulty on the two uphills.  After that, it was a pretty straight walk, with a little bit of uneven terrain.  \nOverall, I enjoy this hike and have gone on it several times now.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '',

Beautiful!', ""Loved this easy trail. Perfect for my husband and I with the 2 and 6 year old. Only complaint was that there wasn't much shade this time of year. Next time we'd come earlier in the morning. It was mostly flat with a few picnic tables and port-a-potties for a little brake which was perfect. The little guys didn't make it all the way to the old mine which was a bummer but played in the river instead. Nice little day hike"", 'Nice little out & back trail.', 'This is a walking service trail.   When you get to the old Quarry the coolness of the mine is very refreshing and up until then it is pretty flat except for a little incline you need to go up to get to the mine.

Very nice hike if you want to get some good walking in.', ""This was a great hike for kids and dogs. Not much traffic for a late may saturday.

Great views of the river and multiple place to hike down from the trail to the Middle Fork of the American River. It seems that the most popular summer use for this trail is to access the river for swimming. Great family trail. Picnic stops with tables, easy river access, an old mine entrance (stand near the gate to get cooled off in the summer!). The hike to the closed mine is only 1.5 miles and would make a great turn around point for smaller children. $10.00 day use fee for the Auburn Recreational Area, but it gives you access to the whole recreation area for the date of the pass (Cal.

There is a separate singletrack Quarry trail that starts on highway 49 closer to Cool, skirts the east side of the working quarry and meets up with the quarry road just short of 2 miles from the trailhead.  So there might be some confusion if you are looking at trail signs, books, etc,Someone mentioned taking the Maine bar trail up to the Wendell Robie trail and back down browns bar.  That is a great option, I would also recommend taking Wendell Robie back to the quarry trail then down to the quarry road for some beautiful meadows, open oak woodlands and views back towards auburn.  Also heading upriver from the Maine bar trail (just climb the Maine bar trail a little & take the trail to the left) takes you to the American Canyon and dead truck trail areas and points beyond.  The Quarry Road is best in spring when the middle fork is rushing and  the seasonal creeks are cascading down across the road,In regards to the comment about trailer trash,  us beer guzzilin' hillbillies don't stray too far from the confluence, and there is lots of shade the further you go.  There is a lot of history on this trail from the flume, mining camp sites along the bars, railroad & quarry, Tevis cup, WST, etc. It's really a pretty nice  trail."", 'Bring water, there is limited shade and my dogs got very hot.\nReally cool cave at the end of trail and beautiful scenery, I will return!! \nAlso lots of places to stop and have lunch and go down to the river and let the dogs drink and play', ""We went on a Friday so it wasn't busy, I'd imagine in the summer it could be packed with people getting to river access.   The Hawver cave part was closed so you could just look through the metal gate and not see much of anything.\nThey have excellent signs for most everything except the actual trail to the Quarry.  There is a sign that says Quarry trail this way but the actual start of the trail isn't marked so we walked right past it as it was overgrown with grass (I think that was it) and not marked at all.\nThere's tables at a couple locations along the path but they probably fill up pretty good on weekends."", ""Great trails enjoyed the hike. to GPS it.... that's the challenge.... use your phone and map it for turn by turn driving directions use Google NAV. Once there, log the POI on your car's GPS to return. I did that because I am not from the area."", ""I went on a hike around this area. We basically just park when there are other cars along the highway just across a bridge generally so there is a pathway down to the water. Sorry I can't be more specific but it's better than paying to park and really anywhere you walk around here is beautiful. My sister took me scrambling along the side of the river over beautiful rocks.  There is great swimming and fishing here! I particularly enjoy seeing the railroad tracks that had fallen in the water, which are perfectly visible in the crystal water.  There are also a few large cement blocks tipped in as well that are fun to see.  Very cool if you are into light rock climbing.  Where we were at least. There are pathways around too of course! But if you want to climb all over things you can find the places to scale :)"", 'This was our second hike of the summer and it was pretty hot. On this trail we learned that boots would be important, that a string knapsack is uncomfortable and useless, that you really need more than a 750 ml of water, that sandwiches cause stomach aches and lastly that candy and Bugles might sound good, but are bad news on the trail.  We were hot, tired and burned out upon returning from this dry dusty trail that attracted crowds of local trailer trash drinking cheap beer at mid day.  The upside is that we all decided to upgrade our gear after this hike and have benefitted since!  This is not much of a hike other than being long.  I have started to not care much for hiking around Auburn because of the heat and general ""dirty ness"" that abounds.', 'You can make this a great hike by going up Main Bar at the end and taking the upper trail to Brown Bar Trail.

hike.. good hike to give kids extra experience.', 'Good views, even through the fog.

Keep an eye out for it!', 'There is a couple of benches towards the end of the trail that overlook the beach.  Very beautiful coastal scenery!  Visited 8/5/2018', 'Great family hike. Very beautiful views.', 'Great for hiking with kids and grandparents', 'Easy hike for kids and being dog friendly is a huge bonus. Views are gorgeous. Parking is busy but didn’t have to wait long (came around 3 pm on gorgeous Saturday)Easy access to additional trails', 'Found parking difficult, probably because of the beach. Nice trail though and only a few other pups which is good for our not so good pup. It’s also very narrow and exposed so bring sunscreen and water.', 'Easy hike with nice views. Parking and beach access available at both ends. No restrooms.', 'very short trail a bit of hill in the beginning and at the turn around but nothing too crazy. the biggest thing is that the parking lot is not to the South of the restaurant as is mentioned in the description but actually to the North. Additionality, the start finish parking lot recommended here is a bit small so I recommend parking at the larger lot at Gray Whale Cove then hiking south to Montara opposed to starting at Montara and hiking north to Gray Whale Cove.', 'Nice view along the trail. Easy walk most of the way. Most of the trail is quite exposed, so make sure wear sunscreen. The trail is probably more suited for cooler days (like winter), I imagine it’d be too hot and too exposed for hot summer days.', 'Fun and beautiful.', 'CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELVES!  This is a beautiful hike that I take my pup on. Today my dad joined us and we went all the way to the top and he got a sharp pain. We checked his shoe and there was nothing. He kept going and the pain continued. Later we found the piece of glass that went sideways into his shoe and was stabbing him. We all like to have a good time but please clean your stuff up and pack it out (it’s even lighter than when you carried it full) So sad, this is a beautiful hike with amazing views that I highly recommend. Just wanted to give a heads up to fellow hikers.', 'Beautiful views', 'This trail has STUNNING views! Whales were breaching just off the coast. The trails has gentle slopes (where not flat) after a slight incline out of the parking area. The first section of the trail can be dense with vegetation, including poison oak; walking single file and carefully is key. Shortly after beginning the trail widens and wildflowers line the trails.', ""I was looking for an easy hike for a girl's trip and this did not disappoint! Accessible for everyone's skill level and beautiful views. We were fortunate enough to see a few whales from the bench lookout and several bunnies along the way. Highly recommend for all levels!"", ""Easy to find and navigate. Brought my dog and boyfriend and we all had great time. Being close to Half Moon Bay, we refueled at Sam's Chowder house where dogs are allowed on the patio. We will be back again and will attempt the harder trails nearby!"", ""Simply the most gorgeous views you'll ever get on a hiking trail.  If mountain cliffs dropping into the smashing waves of the Pacific Ocean aren't for you then steer clear of this little piece of paradise. The trails can get a little narrow when passing, but I'm searching for absolutely anything not to like about this spot."", 'Very easy hike and decent views of Pacifica. Benches available to sit at scenic spots. Parking can get full at times but really depends on days you go, weekends will be busy. Can hike down to the beach also for a good walk but be careful of traffic crossing cause you have to cross main road with two way traffic.Enjoy !!', 'Absolutely beautiful hike!', 'Great hike except for the fact my husband made me trek uphill instead of arpund. Gorgeous view for this flat land Floridian.', ""This is definitely more of a walk than a hike but if you love the ocean then you will surely be a delight. There is a fantastic view of the water the entire time. Easy as pie and highly recommended. It's also a hop skip and jump from the abandoned old bunker so thats totally cool too!"", ""This trail has a lot of great views of the ocean! Definitely on the easy side. There are other trails up there you can take to challenge yourself - just make sure you bring a trail map of the area in the event you don't have cell/internet service."", ""Excellent hike with breathtaking views.

Plan accordingly."", 'Always my favorite easy hike in HMB.', 'easy hike with amazing views !', 'This is a fairly easy hiking trail. I took my 6 month old puppy with me for the first time and he loved it! Amazing views throughout the first half of the trail. We ended up walking to the beach right after! This is definitely somewhere I will be going again! ', 'Beautiful scenery', 'Easy trail with awesome views. You can spot whales from the high points in the trail in summer.', ""This trail was awesome for trail running. Great views of the ocean while going along the side of the hill. I joined up with another trail that did a loop and intersected gray whale trail again. Running, the whole thing took 30 minutes I could've gone longer as there were more trails available to go higher up. Perfect for a morning warm-up."", 'Beautiful views.', 'This is a nice, basic, scenic hike.', 'A very scenic hike. We saw a whale while looking over the ocean!!!

I would do this hike again!!', 'Beautiful easy fun trail :)', 'Beautiful trail with incredible ocean views, links with a quite a few other trails on Montara mountain so you can easily make it a longer and more challenging hike if you feel like it.', 'Lovely trail. Easy enough. Watch out for poison oak!', 'Little fun hike. Dog friendly. Great view!', 'A beautiful hike not too far off the coast, so bring your camera!  The directions for starting from the south end on the ""Getting There"" tab are kind of terrible.  You can park in the parking lot south of Los Constanera, as instructed, but there are 3 parking lots farther north that are closer to the trail head - two on the west side and one on the east side (this one is literally right at the trail head).', 'Its a really gorgeous, easy hike. Only complaints are it was difficult to find from the South end. Parked near where suggested only to find the hike was about half mile walk to the entrance to the trail. Had to ask a few people where it was. Once on the trail - no complaints whatsoever. The views from up there are absolutely breathtaking. Would totally do this again!', 'LOVE IT! Lots of fun. Amazing views. Great hike for dog!!!', 'Dogs are allowed on the hiking trails but not the GWC beach.', 'Unreal view, walk past manzanitas , wild strawberries & blackberries , wild irises red tail Hawks and stunning ocean cliffs', ""Nice trail that's dog friendly, but there were no big features to explore."", 'The stars must have been aligned because when we were on the last mile stretch hugging the coast we actually saw a pod of grey whales in the water heading north.  It not only made the day great but also make it one of the more memorable hikes in my life.', 'Easy to get to. Plenty for parking before 10am on a Saturday in the North parking lot across from the GWC Beach. On a foggy but nice morning the hike was easy and allowed a friend and I to catch up along some nice views of the ocean. Definitely take a moment and take a seat on the benches atop the first hill.Would definitely visit again. Perhaps with my kids - 6 and 3 - in tow.', 'Very nice view, but parking is a nightmare and if you decide to go down to the beach, be prepared to play frogger with traffic.', ""You get a beautiful view of the Pacific Ocean the first few steps you take on this trail. Although this place is known to get really foggy. There is a beach near by for picnics and dogs are allowed. There are numerous trails that you can take if you want to hike further and some small trails with increased hiking difficulty. You can also spot Poppy Flowers here, but don't pick them it's illegal. "", 'Amazing view when the weather is nice. Short and sweet hike, 3.0 round trip loop. A lot of scenery of the ocean. ', ""As other reviewers have said, this should be considered a moderate trail - the ends are quite steep, and most of the trail is fully exposed with no shade. Note that the trail begins and ends on Route 1, but it's not possible to make a loop because this section of Route 1 has virtually no walkable shoulder/paths. The only way is to double-back and return up the hill. Besides this, the trail is quite scenic with many vista points of the ocean."", 'Nice and easy, tons of wild flowers and views of the ocean. We saw s porpoise too! ', 'This trail is NOT easy. It should be rated as moderate in my opinion. Some parts are very easy, but others are very steep with slippery gravel. It is incredibly scenic with amazing views of the pacific. There are also many beautiful wild flowers growing on both sides of the trail. I highly recommend it!', ""Gray Whale Cove is an easy trail with incredible views, especially if you hit it on a nice afternoon. We started our hike in the late afternoon and finished it in about an hour. Incredible sunset hike. Note that AllTrail's main trail instructions have you park at the southern end of the beach (by La Constanera restaurant), walk the beach, and then join the trail at the Northern end of the beach. If you want to avoid the beach walk, better to park at the northern end of the beach by the signs for McNee Ranch State Park. That's where the real hike begins. "", 'Beautiful trail.  On a sunny days, the views of the coast are pretty amazing.  The first 1 mile or so are dirt singletrack.  After that, it turns into an old, badly maintained asphalt path.  First mile is amazing, rest of trail is so so.', 'A really great trail! Some steep and slipper hills but otherwise spectacular. We definitely enjoyed the ocean views and sitting by the shoreline after our hike.', ""I went in the evening and the whole area was quite misty. The views would've been spectacular but I couldn't see much because of the fog. Decided to hike up the first hill the trail loops around and it was quite challenging. The actual trail is a fun, relaxed little walk. Take a light sweater !"", 'THE DESCRIPTION IS INCORRECT; this is not a 4-mile trail.\nThis easy hike that offers some outstanding views, especially on a clear day, of the ocean and the little coves along the shore.  There is a parking area at each end, and it\'s a short out and back trail that\'s about a mile long; so two miles if you actually go out and back. The decent into the first parking lot was a little overgrown when we went, but it\'s a lot of payoff for very little effort really.  There are various little ""connector trails"" that link up to the much longer and strenuous hike to the peak (about 8 miles RT to the North Peak).  We ended up doing the North Peak hike as well since the Cove trail was so short.', 'Awesome & very amazing.', 'Nice trail. Tons of wildflowers along the path. Great views. Starts out with a climb but then levels out for the rest of the hike. ', ""The trail is fairly easy. You have beautiful views and the scent of the ocean fills the air. The trail was a bit busier than I expected for a mid-week hike in April, but there are a few open spots that you can duck into if you want some solitude. It's a good trail for a stroll or a nice walk with a friend or date. "", 'Nice hike. :) I wanted more so I hiked up to the top of N. peak from the top of Grey Whale.

Bikers seem to enjoy it too and the trail is mostly wide enough for everyone. Good mix of shade and sun and a few vistas along the way. Just enough wildflowers in bloom to make it really feel like spring. As marked, the hike is just over 3.8 miles taking the loop clockwise and going Dunn to Graham to West Ridge to Baccharis to Dunn. There is no trail marker where Baccharis and West Ridge intersect. If you don't take a map, you'll want to note that it's 0.4 miles from Graham to Baccharis as you walk along West Ridge, that way you can keep an eye out for that trail. Or if you take the trail in reverse you can't miss the turn from Baccharis to West Ridge as that's where Baccharis ends.

I recommend layers and winter attire but it isn't needed if you're young, just be constantly warm and avoid exposure to wind.

The view is not bad, definitely prettier in the winter imo."", 'I have done this hike two times now it is one of my favorites it is very steep once you pass the ski hut and when I did it a couple of days ago there was snow on the summit so you will probably need crampons soon if we get more snow', 'I loved it started at 2:00 pm. Yesterday came back down devils back bone.', ""I've been to the top of Baldy at least 10 times over the past year or so, but I never went up Ski Hut/Baldy Bowl until today. Just like it looks on the map, it's one of the more direct trails to the summit, albeit quite a bit less scenic that the other options. It would be a nice way for newbie hikers to check Baldy off their 6 pack list, but for a much more scenic experience, consider at least descending via Devils Backbone. If you have legs and lungs for something more challenging, skip Baldy Bowl and take a romp up Register Ridge or Bear Canyon.\n\nAs of Sept 10th 2018 there was water available near the Ski Hut if you want to do the first few miles light and filter later."", 'Difficult, but rewarding.

Left at 8:30 in the morning and only met 5 hikers until reaching the summit. As others suggested, hiking poles are most definitely recommended- I went without. The hike is strenuous particularly the section where the brown trail marking poles are found about one half mileFrom the top.

Beautiful aerial views along the trail!', 'Awesome trail! On March 10, hiked up Baldy Bowl and down Devil’s Backbone to the Notch, about 7.5 miles total. Took the chairlift down the rest of the way. The hike itself took only 4 hours and 3min, but I set a very aggressive pace for myself due to time constraints. The first three miles up to just beyond the ski hut took 1h20min, the next 1.5 miles up to the summit took 1h20min (this segment is very strenuous and absolutely kicked my butt) and the summit down to the Notch took 1h25min. I set out from Manker Flats at 5:22am (with a headlamp as it was not yet twilight) and got to the Notch at 9:26am. The trail was mostly clear of snow and ice for the first three miles. Microspikes were necessary for most of the upper section to the summit due to ice and snow particularly in the steep section beginning about 1/2 mile after the hut. I had downloaded a route into my Garmin watch, which was very helpful (read: necessary) because there are sections between the hut and the summit where it would be very easy to lose the trail. Hiking down Devil’s Backbone was a little scary in parts due to ice and snow along the precipitous drop-offs, however there was enough ground exposed so that I could easily identify and avoid the snow cornices. It is a little hairy right at the western entrance to the Backbone section as there is a lot of snow wedged in the corner next to a fairly steep dropoff. Overall it is a very fun and pretty challenging hike, with amazing views and spectacular scenery along the whole route. Hiking up Baldy Bowl to the summit is an a**kicker but worth the effort. On Devil’s Backbone this time of year use caution and tread carefully along precipitous sections of the trail; and be prepared - I would recommend microspikes and trekking poles, and also bring some layers because there were very significant changes in temperature at the different elevations and much wind chill at the summit.', 'Having hiked this trail dozens of times, I have never done it in February before this trip. It is definitely a dry year with just a few areas of icy snow in the gully section, I used my spikes but they were really not necessary. As always there was a lot of traffic as this is one of the most popular trails in the San Gabriels.', 'Went up the baldy bowl itself straight from the ski hut to the baldy peak. This is NOT the regular trail and is a popular mountaineers route when snow conditions are good; however, I did it with no snow in February. It was a difficult scramble because of loose sharp rocks and steep sandy/rocky surface. I would only recommend this with snow.', 'Hiked here on leg on Mt. Baldy hike.

I had already completed San Jacinto Marion Trail and San Gorgonio Vivian Creek via Momyer Parking lot due to primary parking lot being full prior to this hike and was still able to check this off in 4 h 04 min from car to car.  Easy or hard is relative - to me, this was the easiest of the the trails I had done that day.  \n\nThe feedback I have is the risk of hiking at night alone and the fact that I had to do a little route finding since I was not familiar with the trail and there were a few side trails that could be confused as primary trail.  If you hike this trail during the day route finding should NOT be an issue.  Trail is well defined and marked.  On the way back down I had zero issues finding the route.   \n\nWater is available at the stream near the ski hut, which is more than half way up to the top distance wise but from there you still have about 2,000' in climb left.  Just remember if you are traveling light and want to use the water source, you still have to go up then come back down before you get to the same water source again.  Some people forget the water source is double the distance to the summit.  Because I hiked at night and I didn't push myself to the point of perspiration I consumed only 1L of water the entire trip.  This would be a good mountain to hike at night on a clear day to view the stars.\n\nA good easy mountain to hike if you have half a day or night to kill."", 'Needs more water meaning deeper creek or rivers to cliff jump their wasent any', ""I made a loop by going up Baldy Bowl and down Devil's Backbone.

It got down to about 27 degrees. I was up by 7am and pushing for the summit. I reached the summit by noon, and was on my way back down via Devils Backbone which is a much flatter and easier hike even though there are some sketchy parts where people have fallen to their death. It's a much easier exit out. My pack severely slowed me down, but it's always a good feeling to know I have everything on my person I need to survive on the mountains for days at a time if need be."", ""We went up Devils Backbone and down Baldy Bowl... sort of. We went right and ended up above the Waterfall, I knew the trail was to the left, so we just cut left and we were alright. But the newbies that were with us had a rough time hiking down. - TRAIL is NOT MARKED and it is very easy to go wrong. Why it's not marked is a mystery. The rescue helicopters must surely know this? They circle overhead as other hikers were lost too.\n\nSo, if you want to try this steeper trail, I suggest going up this way and down the other.

I cannot wait to go back. It was tough but so worth it. Took me about 4.5 hours round trip. I took about 1.5 L of water/Skratch mix. ( I do a lot of trail running for reference).

All looked to enjoy the clear sunny day.', ""CRAZY hike!! I came down this way from the Baldy summit (I hiked up Baldy from the Devil's Backbone trail) and hell was it a hairy trail! Next time I think I might do this hike the opposite way, they aren't kidding you when they say the Baldy Bowl is the steepest of the trails you'll take to get to Baldy! There was still snow on Mount Harwood near the top and a lot of the surrounding mountains from the storm a few weeks previous. I think it would be alot easier to climb up this way than down as I did. All in all a beautiful and rewarding hike though,definitely a must do!! Bring lots of water on this hike, you're going to need it."", 'This is the most difficult but most rewarding hike that I have been on in my life.

I've climbed the Manker Flat one several times.  Arduous.  Start early ( started at 6 a.m.), plenty of liquids, there is the Sierra Club hut.  Near the top there appear to be alternative trails, which all end up recombining, but some of them are more adventuresome than others.  Waiting to do the Bear Canyon trail but, as it starts in the village, it may be a two-car/person hike."", 'Amazing hike! A true hike! Bring plenty of water & food. While walking at a slow pace with plenty of breaks it took our group about 7 1/2 hours to complete the hike to the peak and back. If it is your first time I would recommend starting early!

There are multiple trails you can take from the state park and you can also ride on the Santa Cruz county trail that will take you all the way to the boardwalk.

Not that I'm aware of!"", 'This is an easy flat hike but it will take you awhile because the views are so incredible. I bring all my out of town company here to get a taste of what the California coastline is like. There is a cool cave called the Fern Cave that has ferns growing out of the ceiling.

It's fun for all skill levels, and the views are spectacular.  I even took an excursion trip, riding a side trail over the cliff down to the beach.  I recommend only experienced downhill riders try that.  The bluff trail follows the top of the bluffs along the ocean.  It rises and falls, but never too much for less experienced riders.

There is a ranger on site 24 hrs/day, and they also give free firewood. Also, there is a basic toilet, and water from a faucet out of the ground, but I packed in most of my water anyway.

It was about 2 1/2-3ft in length and never became aggressive, just was watching as we were. I noticed the Henninger Flat sign at the top is gone, but it made for a nice seating area to rest and overlook the city. The nearly full moon was fantastic and made for an awesome moonlit hike without needing to use the headlamp, and temperatures remained excellent with a nice light breeze for the hike down. If you are familiar with the trail and exit point after sunset it's an excellent summer evening choice!"", ""Good trail. I don't know that I would call it easy, though. Moderate, but not easy."", 'Good exercise.', 'Easy', ""straight up and straight down...wide road with nice views of downtown la. pretty basic hike. when you reach the top it's amazing.  very clean campsite with plenty of shade.oh yeah no shade at all on the hike up...took me 50 mins to make it to the top."", 'Tough run. Straight up, straight down. Well-groomed. Will encounter hikers and bikers.', 'A lot of people below are mixing this hike with eaton canyon hike, which are the same in the beginning but while henninger is all about inclination ,eaton is a very short , easy and leveled hike for the family. Half way through the canyon hike, turn right at the bridge towards the mountain on the fire road. Continue on this road to reach the flats. They are nice meadows of pine trees overlooking Pasadena. If you continue on this trail you can reach mount Wilson but it would be the least desirable trail to Wilson due to being a fire road.', ""Beautiful hike, take enough water and make sure you reach the top because it's worth it , could be done in 2 to 3 hours. Decent elevation ."", 'easy overnight pack in, perfect to try out new gear or to get away even if its only overnight. \nCamp spots have small fireplaces and camp provides firewood. When i went there was a posted sign that said  Water ( from the spigot at the camping spots )  needed to be filtered or boiled prior to drinking.', 'Another evening walk on the hillside. :)', ""Another after work adventure! I decided to jump on a listed group hike to finish out the week. This trail is similar to the Claremont Loop in grade and that it is a fire road, but it doesn't offer any shade until you get to the flats. This trail is well maintained and more of a backside workout walk than a hike. There were about two dozen people on the trail including the group I invaded and a few mountain bikers who were very cautious and patient. The trail is mainly on the southern face of the mountain so you have constant views of the San Gabriel Valley and beyond. The access gate is open during daylight hours only and controlled by the nearby residents, so be prepared to take the south trail out if you miss the sunset cutoff. The locals informed me the distance to the flat and back is approximately 5.4m, to which we all completed in less than two hours. I'm sure it would have been less had I went my own pace, but what fun is joining a group if you aren't with it! Many thanks to their kindness to an opportunist. :)  I learned that this trail goes to Mt. Wilson, so creating an interesting loop through to Chantry Flat might be a future plan! crzyrabbit@gmail.com"", 'Definitely a nice little hike. Would rate it 3.5. We hiked to the left to the waterfall. It was mostly rocky but also some sandy trails. Nice little waterfall to take pix and cool off in the water pool. I would do it again.', ""Henningar hike is by far my favorite hike in the area. My dog is in heaven as soon as we get past the crowd headed up to the waterfall, hit the fire road and it's as hard as you decide to challenge yourself. Or not. Spring is the best time as far as temp, greenery and runoff from the annual snowfall which can make good conditions for the creek, provided we've received any rainfall. Occasionally the mountain bikers can be inconsiderate but for the most part they share the road. The best part is once you get to the Flats you can keep hiking up Mt. Wilson as far as your legs will carry you, and on clear days you can see all the way to the ocean!! Another option is get someone to drop you off at the top of Mt. Wilson and hike all the way down, which takes 7-9 hours."", 'Walked up the Mt. Wilson Toll Road for the first time in more than 40 years.  I give this hike four stars just because it\'s where it all started for me.  We hiked up there pretty regularly when we were kids...it was a big deal when we were small.  I took a side trip to Eaton Canyon Falls.  Last time I was there the canyon was was gated and there were metal ladders bolted to the cliff face for getting past the falls.  Good fishing above the falls, as I recall.  A good resource for the San Gabriel Mountains is ""Dan\'s Hiking Pages""  (www.simpsoncity.com/hiking.)', 'Exposed fire road with no shade.  However, the destination makes it all worthwhile.  Picnic tables, restrooms, and a visitor center.  Great place to relax for a while before starting back down the trail.', "" Love this trail! It's best to start early in the morning or early evening as there is very little shade. I must say though, this trail is one oft favorites. The incline offers a nice challenge and I love the sunlight! The campgrounds at the top are nice and primitive. The view is expansive for the most part. Some days the smog/dust layer gets in the way, but oh well. I usually do this trail on Sundays. Eaton Canyon and the waterfalls nearby have been a local favorite of mine since I was a youngster."", 'Perfect for a weekend brief but moderately challenging outdoor activity. Will do this again and go to Mt. Wilson next time.', 'Several other people here have said the same, the map shown at the time of this review is wrong. Also, this trail\'s usage cannot be considered ""Light"" by any standard. The fire road is wide and well graded. Watch for the mountain bikers, they\'re usually screaming downhill and hoping you\'ll move. Keep an eye on the switchbacks ahead and you\'ll see them coming. Visit the museum, it\'s actually got some interesting stuff. Not a lot of stuff, but some of it is actually interesting. ', 'Did the hike last night, the map shown here does not match the trip, the entire hike is on a fire/service road (Mt. Wilson Toll Road).  I kept thinking I was going the wrong way and almost turned back twice.  Not bad on a cool evening or early morning, but I prefer actual hiking trails, not road, therefore a two star rating.  The views were ok, better if there was no smog, but this is LA.  A few mountain bikers coming down, one of them almost hit us as he did not appear to have too much control.', ""Kind of boring. Just like the others said, it's straight up up up about 3 miles up a service road with very little shade and not a lot of nature besides a few lizards. Saw several bikers and a few runners. Took us a little over an hour to get to the top with 2 short breaks. At the top is a cute campground with visitor center, restrooms, and a drinking fountain. Nice views of smoggy LA but that's about it. "", 'Getting up to the Henninger Flats was really rewarding. After hiking the sun-exposed trail, the tall trees provided us with shaded comfort while we perused the site. Cute museum! You can leave your name or a message in a big fancy guestbook;) This is a nice hike. You can continue on to Mount Wilson about 7 miles up.', ""Its a  pretty much strenuous and grueling hike. It took us 2.5 hrs up-hill with 2-3 breaks. Wear comfortable shoes and after reaching the Hennington flats (2632 ft.), you can go to the rest room, an old museum, basically a chilly camping area. Warning: Don't go further up to Mt. Wilson 5710 ft. unless you are prepared. Mountain bikes are not allowed at a point, but many people were still using them. Before you go to Hennington flats, please visit Eaton Canyon which is a must hike!"", ""Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful! Absolutely loved it! This hike is a work out! No joke. But the campsites, museum and view make it worth it. It's all uphill! My family and I backpacked as practice for the PCT.  My 10 year old complained a little bit but she did it. It was cloudy with chance of rain, and even then, we were sweating. I wouldn't recommend this hike in the summer as there is no shade. Eaton Canyon trail connects but we didn't try it. We plan on going back. People were nice, dogs were friendly. Considering it was Sunday, not a lot of folks. Enjoy."", ""Chantry flats trailhead was closed yesterday so our group started of to Mt Wilson from here.  In the pouring rain and fog we couldn't see anything on the way up, but the trip down afforded great views. --- As noted you can go 3 miles to the flats, but you can continue on all the way to Wilson, about 8 or 9 miles to top, putting your total out and back at 16+ miles and at least 4200 elevation gain."", 'Somewhat steep incline but easy fire road up takes about an hr and a half up.', 'Toll road is maintained for a well marked trail.  Popular w/the locals..great cardio..up & back.  We take our time & explore all we find along the way.  A fun hike to look back on the steady uphill switchbacks that are accomplished!  Once to the top of Henninger Flats...is quite the change of scenery!  An evergreen nursery, a campground that overlooks the valley, nature center & outdoor collection of mining & mtn history...all free of charge.  ', ""Gosh it's hot! I can't wait to do this one again when it's cooler outside. Still, as someone who lives in the area, I can't believe I hadn't been here earlier. The trail is a fire road and easy to pass, but I sure got winded on an August sunny day. I stopped to catch my breath at the one and only shaded bench. Once I got to the top, I had a great time looking at all the artifacts and exploring the campgrounds and the nursery. This is definitely one to bring visitors on.

We had some snow what made our hiking even better. Be prepared with gloves, beanie and a warm jacket because it was very windy and cold.', 'One of the most beautiful hikes I have ever done. Temperatures were cool...48 at the bottom and about 34 with the wind chill at the top. Lots of snow at this time which makes for a magical, serene experience. Breathtaking views at the top. Uphill trek for approx 1.5 miles then some flat land. Five oak trail on the way back- slippery and muddy be careful. Poles would h w been helpful! Great for dogs and there is a local friendly mountain dog named Alice who went up the mountain with us. Don’t be alarmed and enjoy!!!', 'Great hike! I wouldn’t steer off to Five Oaks Trails. I felt the Volcan Trail was less trafficked and better views. Good terrain and my Fitbit reflected 150 floors climbed.', ""The trek up is pretty much entirely uphill & definitely keeps your heart rate up. It's a pretty awesome view from the top though & dog friendly as well. We went during the cooler months when it didn't really top 70°, but if you go when it's warmer be sure to bring enough water to get you through since there's nowhere to refill & the last stretch has no tree cover at all. Not far into your uphill trek, you'll see a sign on your right for Five Oaks Trail. Definitely take that side trip; it hooks back up with Volcan Mountain Trail further up & has some beautiful views. Have fun!"", 'Nice hike, pretty easy/wide trail much of the way. Suggest taking the side Five Oaks trail for the best views and less people (even though a bit harder and narrower).', 'Stunning views on a beautiful fall day.  Main trail is very family and dog friendly. A little blustery at the top but didn’t take away from it all.', 'Really nice trail, especially the five oaks trail section. A lot people and unfortunately dog poop.', 'The trail is wide and well maintained, would be a good one to bring the pups. Nice views at the top of the summit', 'Beautiful hike with a moderate amount of steep sections', 'great hikers and viewers.', 'Really great hike in Julian with beautiful fields. Also a great one for dog lovers!', 'This was a great trail: clearly marked, well-maintained, and provided a diversity of landscapes, vegetation, and wildlife.', ""East to get to, great views, and more shade than I had expected.  However, there were a lot of flies and gnats flying into my face than I preferred.  I've done this hike twice and the experience was the same both times."", 'What a great hike! I took 5 Oaks up and the road trail back down. I LOVED the views from 5 Oaks, and all the shade. I was super slow on the ascent because I was taking so many pics. It was very windy once I was about a mile from the summit - it felt great!! If you’re not hiking with dogs I would definitely recommend doing the 5 Oaks trail, at least on the way up (dogs aren’t allowed on the 5 Oaks trail). The other path was pretty steep and seemed to never end, but was fine for the descent. Some people I met while on their way up that trail were pretty winded. I would definitely do this one again.', 'Nice and more shade then you would expect.', 'One of my favorites!  If you go right after the last snowfall you manage to see two seasons.  Beautiful!', 'Quiet. Very nice hike. Enjoyed the flowers. Saw a deer and wild turkeys. Took 5 oaks trail up and stayed straight coming down.', 'Beautiful easy going hike ideal for families or beginners - but the incredible views make it worthwhile for everyone. I went up the 5 Oaks trail and came down the regular one - worth taking the 5 Oaks for the extra views along the way.', 'Great hike. A favorite for sure. Did the regular trail with my 10 year old. Fantastic views throughout and phenomenal from the top.', 'Fantastic hike with fantastic views at the top', 'very easy walking ...very scenic.', 'good distance, beautiful hike', 'This is a great hike. Going up through the 5 oak trail on the way up is the best.  Great views from there too plus it is covered most of the time.  You get to see both sides of San Diego mountain peaks. Very comfortable hike. A must see hike for sure.', 'Had a great time hiking Volcan mountain today, the grade is pretty steep but some well placed tree canopy’s provide some shaded patches through out. Highly recommend, the view from the top is well worth it', 'Took 5 oak trail to summit. Good hike and good views. multiple outlook points at summit and during hike!check out instagram.com/gregszymbor for photos and more hikes', 'Amazing view! I’d recommend taking the Five Oak Trail which makes the hike a little longer but there are more beautiful views that way', 'Beautiful views', 'Closer to 5.2 miles if you take the five oaks trail on the way back. Elevation gain is significant but there are shady spots to rest and the views at the top are worth it!', 'Amazing views! Love this trail!', 'Beautiful and peaceful views. I wish I brought a book to read at the bench at the top!', 'nice hike close to Julian.  great views from up there.', 'It is end of February and my dog and I loved this wide and well maintained trail. First time my dog saw and got to play in the snow. It was windy and cold at the top. Beautiful views all the way to the ocean on one side and the desert on the other.', 'Such a beautiful hike and some amazing views from the top!', 'Great trail but can get very windy at the top! Take five oaks trail on your way down. Fun trail! Amazing views. Worth it!', 'Good quick hike!   Great views on a clear day from the top!', 'Beautiful view and lovely nature.', 'Great short hike with excellent views at the top.', 'Lovely trail with great views. The uphill climb is no joke - I found this to be pretty strenuous but maybe I’m just out of shape... lots of shady places to rest, thankfully. Bring your own water and bags for your dog if you have one. Water/bags not provided at trailhead.', ""I'm not an avid hiker although I enjoy it very much (I need to make time for more of it. 2018 goal!). I would've considered this moderately strenuous though. The uphill trek was rocky and steeper at some areas than expected. highly recommend a walking stick and sturdy hiking shoes.The view was beautiful! the marine layer was covering the ocean, but the perspective of seeing many mountains in SD County is breathtaking."", 'Easy trail. Weather was cold and crisp.', 'Stunning views from the top, you can see all the way to the ocean and Catalina island west and the Salton Sea  east. the Five Oaks trail is a nice little extra on the way back down, giving a very different hiking experience and scenery than the main trail.', 'Beautiful trail, very scenic. We hiked to the telescope. The views are amazing!', 'love this trail! spectacular views, wide trail, amazing!', 'I love this trail first thing in the morning. We started at 7 am , we saw the moon set and the sun rise , we saw 4 dear, it got really foggy then cleared up at the top.... just amazing!', 'Nice hike.  Really nice views and well maintained.  Great for a quick family hike.', 'The trail has wide road(for maintenance cars) and lots of shades. I think it’s a good trail for a group. There is a trail, naming Five Oaks Trail in parallel. We took the main trail pass on the way to peak and tried Five Oaks on way back. The trail of Five Oak is much narrow and steep. It’s totally different from the main trail for the view, so it’s good that we can try two kinds of trails at once. If you aren’t confident in your physical strength, I think you should choose to keep the main trail for hill climb, not Five Oaks trail.', 'Steady climb with decent shade and lots of interesting flora. Perfect temperature for a midday hike.', 'I started this hike half way though because we started hiking from the Five Oaks Trail which was really nice. once we started on this it waa really easy and nice to walk all the way to the top. Great views and my 2 year old loved walking back down from the viewpoint.', 'I hike this out and back trail every time I go to Julian. It is steady uphill climb to top. All downhill on the way back to start. Nice views towards the ocean and desert the other direction. Probably 2/3 is under tree cover. Trail is well maintained. A pleasant hike.', 'started around 9 and finished around 12 or so. Really enjoyed the summit but flies and gnats were kinda driving my son and I buggy. Very interesting history along the trail. I would do this one again. the gate at the entrance was cool. Really enjoyed sitting at the bench a relaxing for bit.', 'Me and my 6 year old son did this hike. The view at the top was awesome. The hike was very easy to navigate, nothing crazy.', ""This is probably a pretty good hike, however, I tried to start at 1:30pm and it was way too hot to continue. I know... that's too late to start, but I decided to give it a go. It's pretty steep, and not many flat areas. I'll do it again but in the Fall or early AM."", 'Check conditions and pack accordingly... winds were gusting at close to 50mph at the summit.', ""I just had a GREAT experience on this trail. Easy to find, beautiful views, few people out. The best part was the Julian Blues festival in the valley below. Such a treat for this hike. You are super exposed on the first part of the hike so I was really struggling with the heat and the incline is steep. Other than that it was great. I'll be back on a cooler day."", ""A friend and I thoroughly enjoyed this hike. There's a moderate incline on the way up that provides some good cardio but nothing too strenuous. The trail is wide and in good condition. Views along the way and at the top are beautiful. Will definitely plan to hike this one again."", 'My first hike in San Diego! It did not dissappoint! Fun day of adventure with my gyspy friends! Blake, David and Debbie!', 'Starts out kinda boring as you walk the first part on the fire road . Once you branch out on the Five Oaks trial it gets really nice . The hike up will work your legs but well worth the effort . Lots of big trees flowers and views . You can see well beyond The Salton Sea .  It will be winding ( maybe cold ) at the top and watch for snakes as we came a little to close to a Green Mojave on the Summit .  Coming back down you can take the fire road but I would recommend going back on The 5 Oaks trial  .  The fire road is steep rocky and not much to see .', ""It was a beautiful and pleasant hike. It started off with a steady continuous upward slope, just enough to keep your heart rate going but not too difficult to the point where you need a break. It has lots of shades, plenty of trees, and you get to see a beautiful scenery once you've reached summit"", ""It turned out to be such a beautiful day, which made this hike even better! Only saw a handful of people on the trail, but pretty much had it to ourselves. Parked on the road, you walk up a pebble drive past someone's peaceful home which was picturesque itself and you could smell there roses from the distance. The whole hike starting at the beginning by walking through the caved entrance  is like walking into a fairytale story. Even with a Redwood forest. We really enjoyed this hike, and along the way a few benches, one dedicated to someone's loved one, with views to enjoy and get your breath back."", 'Post says ""No Dogs"", but other sites I\'ve read said dog friendly.  Can anybody confirm? I\'d like to take a hike up there this weekend, but, I\'d like to bring my dog.', ""We went on a blustery day and the views were amazing. It reminded me of being home in Scotland with the clouds blowing through the trees and getting glimpses of the valley below through cloud breaks. Definitely take the Five Oaks Trail. It is much more scenic than the standard fire road that the main trail is. We didn't make it all the way to the top as you were hiking through the clouds to get there but we will definitely be going back. I highly recommend."", 'relatively easy hike. Def take the side trail up and dirt road back. Not super secluded from civilization but views are nice.', 'Good trail!', 'Great views!', ""Beautiful hike! Did this on a chilly winter morning, bring gloves and something to break the wind if it's less than 55 degrees. Great views at the top. Saw 8 deer, beautiful!!"", ""Absolutely love this hike. The first half is a thigh killer because you're quicky increasing elevation but it eases up the second half. The views are worth it all. One of the most breathtaking views, in my opinion, in San Diego."", 'Nice less-traveled hike to some beautiful views. Nature trail markers along the way describe wildfires that have hit the area and plants/trees.  You can hike up the service road, or take the Five Oaks Trail off-shoot. Both offer great views, though the service road is fairly open to the sun. Parking is on the side of the road. Dog (on-leash) friendly.', 'A great hike! Go when it is cool out for the most fun.', 'a little steep at first but didnt last all that long.  view at the top was nice.  The trail is wide because its a service road basically.  I reccoment taking the side trail, 5 Oaks Trail, because its narrower and feels more like hiking.', 'Loved this trail. Spectacular views!', 'A fun, fairly quick hike to the top. We visited on a rainy day and the trail was manageable but with a creek running down its center.  the incline is easy to moderate at best.', 'Fun hike in snow last week and also very beautiful trail!!', 'Great hike with lots of panoramic views.', 'Great trail!  Amazing views!  High elevation and will definitely work your lungs!  The views from the top are well worth it!', 'Immediate and steady moderate climbing through the first 1.25 miles of the hike. Second half of the ascent was easier and primarily through high meadows. Views of 60+ miles to the Coronado Islands are possible on a clear day. Recommend hiking around late afternoon towards dusk for sunset views.', '', 'A lot of one way up hill and one way down hill but fun hike.', 'Fun hike!', 'Great hike....highly recommended it...', 'This was a beautiful trail to hike but, not a good hike for beginners. We had 2 non-hikers in our group & the constant climb was a little much for them. The hike down however, was easy peasy.', 'Friendly people on the trail and cute pups everywhere', 'Fun and beautiful. Serene.', 'Views are unreal.', 'great trek around stunning views. really easy to navigate especially for a 1st time visitor.', 'It was nice to hike with kids. It was little bit hard for them, but they were really excited on the top.', ""Great views,  kind of steep but it was cool and breezy too. I'll definitely come back when it gets greener."", 'It was a beautiful hike. The breeze made it very nice. Definitely time to go would be early Fall or Spring', 'Lovely hike. I was welcome with wild deers and saw  a snake on the way down. It was a nice cool weather despite that it was hot in SD. I am definitely coming back.', ""Fun hike pretty easy really, it's strep no switchbacks but not difficult. To go up and have the wind whipping and see for miles is awesome. Directions are great!"", ""This was a pretty fun trail we started around 9am and finished a couple hours later. The way up was easy enough with some shady spots and a breeze which definitely helped! We took the 5 Oak trail on the way down which was nice to get different scenery but was more within the forest. There was also poison oak.We noticed every time we got in the shade, a swarm of flies wouldn't leave us alone! That was our biggest complaint. We saw a sheriff exiting the trail just as we started with a net covering his whole head and I wouldn't do this trail again with out one of those. Also fun, at the bottom of the hill/entrance point there a couple wineries with tasting rooms and a u-pick apple orchard."", 'I hiked this on superbowl sunday 2016 and still made it home to watch the game. I got lucky because it was an incredibly clear day albeit very windy with santa ana winds. It was clear enough to see the Salton Sea to the east and Catalina Island in the west. Never imagined that i could get that lucky. I posted some pictures here that just dont do it justice. Ive hiked dozens of peaks all over SAan Diego county and this is dfinetly my favorite view. You can really observe alot of different peaks from this vantage point. Highly recommend this hike for anyone that hasnt already done. \nOne last thing- I stayed on the fireroad all the way up but on the way down split off on the Five Oaks trail which is a very nice single track with great views from the side of the mountain.', 'One of my FAVORITE hikes! Good distance, secluded, and amazing views! Could see the Salton sea on one side and the ocean on the other. Nice blot of wild flowers at the top too. Just gorgeous. I recommend this any day. Lots of shade too.', 'Gorgeous hike, definitely would recommend the 5 Oaks Trail, beautiful views.', 'Pretty sweet hike.  Views  for days.  Take the five oaks trail section, it is really peaceful and pretty.', 'Beautiful. We made it to the meadow', 'Went with true pup and had a blast. Breezy day, beautiful views, a fairly easy hike in my book. Awesome view of the sultan sea from the top. Ate delicious pie in Julian on the way down. Thumbs up.', 'I would rate it moderate-difficult, as the elevation change is challenging.  Keep an eye out for rattlesnakes also, as we saw 2 of them on this hike yesterday.', 'Gaining 1,200 feet in 2.5 miles is a challenge for most hikers; perhaps taxing for older (us) or inexperienced hikers. But oh, the view! There are several spots on top where you can see 50+ miles to the west, and even farther to the east including the Salton Sea and the Chocolate Mountains beyond. Closer in, you can pick out communities like Ranchita and Shelter Valley. Stop to smell the lupine...', 'This trail is marked as easy but I would consider it to be moderate to hard. It is uphill for at least 2 miles and then tapers off for the last mile up. I took the trail to the summit (not the Five Oaks trail). We hiked in the late afternoon and others were hiking down as we hiked up. Saw multiple groups of people. The views at the top are incredible on a clear day! Nice wide trail so we brought our dog on leash.', 'We a mountain a Lauren at Thursday, Mar 24.  Light east winds of clear and arid air - outstanding the view the Pacific, SD downtown, Borrego Mt., Salton Sea...', 'Take the hiking trail up to the midpoint of the mountain, the views are great and there are less people.', 'We really enjoyed this hike! We took the main service road up to the summit and then took the five oaks trail back down for a total of about 5.5 miles. The views from the top are really lovely. We pretty much had the trail to ourselves which was really nice. We started up the trail around 8:30am so the ground was mostly still frozen after recent snow and rain. On way down we did run into a bit of slippery mud as the day started to warm up, but nothing too treacherous.', ""Been on this hike many times but just got this app. It's a good hike up. Views are awesome."", 'Take the switch back to the right.  It offers beautiful panoramic views to the west before connecting to the service road and the final accent.  It is also much dryer and not slippery like the service road.  The summit is amazing!', 'Great intermediate hike...', 'Amazing trail. We hiked the full 5 1/2 miles round trip to the summit. The ever changing scenery it breathtaking and the view from the top: from the sultan sea in the Anza-Borrego desert to the coast is fantastic.', 'This hike was extremely picturesque. Took the five oaks trail heading up to the summit. Could see the Salton Sea to the east and the ocean to the west. Gorgeous. Perfect for a brisk fall day. A bit steep in the beginning but incline fairly gradual after that. Saw a baby rattlesnake and tons of birds. Very well maintained and clearly marked trail. 5 miles out and back. Would have stopped by the nearby winery if we had time! Next time.', ""We did this trail at night with a group of strangers led by a ranger. About 7 - 10 minutes into it we saw a pair of glowing eyes and it turns out there are free roaming cattle here. They aren't exactly afraid of you either so stay your distance. There also wild turkeys here.  The trail is very green, several creeks are dotted around the path, and the night sky is beautiful."", 'The five oaks trail was great!', 'Very picturesque setting. Make sure to go in the early hours of the day, much easier hike that way.', 'Beautiful, pretty easy but challenging enough that I felt I got a great workout.', 'Nice hike and views', 'Good hot today but good hike', 'I really enjoyed this trail. It starts off pretty steep but becomes more gradual. Beautiful views and shady trees!', ""Very scenic & a pretty easy trail. Great views. Not a lot of people either which is nice. Tons of wild sage here so it smells amazing! Bonus: There's 2 wineries right next door that we visited just in time to enjoy a tasting for sunset."", 'Very pretty views and not too strenuous. Really fun hike, will be back. Went on a weekday and we were the only ones on the trail.', ""This is a great trail! It's an uphill trek the hole way but not too difficult. Totally worth it when you get to the top. Would definitely do this again."", ""I hiked this trail in early May before the hot weather came, so there was a 70 degree east wind that made it a pleasant hike. The fields were still a little bit green too, and visibility was okay, but not extra clear. It may have been desert dust from the east that made it hazy, but the air was otherwise very clean and refreshing. The 5 Oaks trail is a must see, and I saw it on the way up. I also went to the summit and was rewarded with the views to the east, and had a little picnic lunch there. The trails were not crowded, with enough people to have some occasional company, but not so much as to be too many people around. There are no geocaches up there, don't know why, but there are a few wineries in the valley below for those who enjoy that activity.\n\nI made a short video that shows a sample of what the hike is like, updated in July 2016.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/SasGHGkZdiA"", 'My mom and I enjoyed this hike on a 70 degree day in February. We are both very active, enjoy hiking regularly and would agree that it is Moderate. The beginning trail is rather steep but the views at the top are spectacular. The 3.2 mile loop does not include the summit hike which is an additional 2 mile loop for a total of 5, from the beginning  of the trail, around the summit and back. The ""5 Oaks Trail"" is a switch back trail and another option for going up or down. Beautiful scenery and overhanging oaks. (Watch for poison ivy) BRING WATER!!!!', ""Great trail for my wife and I. She's 7 months prego so is was a perfect distance for us. Good views on the way to the summit but not much shade. Take the 5 oaks turn off if you want more shade but be careful! Lots of poison oak.  I wish I had known sooner but there's a sign about half way warning you. Then of course you see it everywhere. You'd think with the rest of the maintenance they'd get rid of it. Overall another good one that's not crowded..."", 'Went April 21st nice weather and no one there. We met one other couple and only 5 other cars were parked out front. Fairly steep going up definitely not kid friendly or beginner friendly. We go hiking a few times a month and are in fairly good shape so it was a good workout. Beautiful views and scenery the whole way, lots of bugs so spray is a good idea. Poison oak is on the trail so beware. We decided not to summit today so we can come back for a ""new"" hike. Awesome hike can\'t wait to go again!', 'This is a very difficult trail in the beginning, especially if you stay on the main road and don\'t go the 5 Oaks trail on the way up.  It\'s worth all the effor though!  View from near the top is amazing.  Like any hike in socal the best time to go is in spring because it\'s green and not as hot.  This trail can get very hot since there isn\'t a lot of shade.  The hills are rolling and beautiful and as you go up you have the mountains and valleys on one side and the desert on the other.\n\nI keep mentioning ""near the top"" because right at the top, it\'s surrounded by a bunch of trees!  You can\'t see anything but just down a bit from the top is where the vies are breathtaking.  My ""track"" has more of a writeup and gpx!', 'Nice trail in the Julian area.  We hiked the trail over Thanksgiving weekend with 2 teens and an 8 yr old boy with no problems.  Hiked it in 1:53 with several stops along the way.   ', 'A bit of a steep climb in parts on the way up; but wow! the view at the top is spectacular. You can see such a vast expanse of space with mountains to the east and rolling grassy valleys to the west. Trail is very established, take water, go alittle further to the summit it is definitely worth the extra mile.', ""This is a difficult run.  I took the Five Oaks Trail on the way up and ran back on the main trail from that intersection.  It was hot, dry, solitary and a lot of strenuous fun.  The main trail is an out-and-back, not a loop.  Don't forget water."", ""Went out today. Difficult uphill, but beautiful, very green and alot of trees and shade. We didn't get to finish cause we ran into a mountain lion, we took a picture of it and went right back down the mountain. Reported it to rangers for safety. It's beautiful but be careful out there."", ""This hike is worth the view from the top and the amazing winds! (It was quite windy when we got  up to the top, which was neat). You get a nice variety of vegetation (from forest to open fields of grass). It's a great short day hike!"", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '',

Went counter clockwise. Very steep up the creek to the falls. Eventually it leveled out to picnic area about 1.5 miles in. The trail around to the east was very nice and well maintained. Not a lot of views and the trail was in shade most of the way. From the where the trail went back down to the lake, the trail back to the original trail at the falls was long. Probably because it was hot and it seemed to keep going and going and going. Once at the turn off at the falls and back to parking, the rest of the hike was all down hill. The guide says it is 7+ miles but my iPhone activity said I went 9.3 miles. I do a lot of hiking and this distance seemed more accurate.', 'Cataract falls is an amazing trail.

Cataract Trail is almost completely wooded and you'll see small waterfalls. Near the middle of the hike, you'll enter a beautiful expanse of green hills and flowers; it looked a little like the Wizard of Oz. \n- Wildlife: we saw deer and a sleeping owl during the trail :) No birds.\n- Bathrooms: there was 1 portable potty at the parking lot\n- Shoes: the inclines were mostly stairs, so regular exercise shoes worked fine for me. The declines / inclines were not gravely / sandy."", 'A bit rough on the old joints but awesome hike.', 'One of the most scenic hikes in the area.  The waterfalls are amazing. We took a detour to the top of the hill across the Ridgecrest road to find some breathtaking 360 views down to Stinson beach. It was a perfect spot for lunch.

Waterfalls, forest, meadows, lake, marshes. l'd definitely do this one again!"", ""All future hikes will be in tough competition with this gorgeous beauty. The first mile (stairs, steps, stairs, steps, etc) is tough but the scenery is  breathtaking.  Cataract Falls Trail was crowded with both hikers and people strewn about the waterfalls. You can't blame them, it's awesome and peaceful. It's easy to miss the High Marsh Trail when it veers off to the left. (If you hit the open meadow and road, turn back). This is where the loop gets really unique. From deep forest to Alpine meadow to streams and the lake. Other people have said it, fuel up at the lake, you'll want to for the next mile up! That climb at the end makes the return trip down Cataract even more heavenly."", 'First mile or so was a climb, but there were beautiful falls to view along the way up.

Tough at the beginning, but the falls are worth it. The lake makes for a nice lunch break.', 'This trail was beyond fabulous! The first part is waterfall central, you basically ascend very quickly, following the waterfall up a steep incline. After about a mile or so, the trail starts to even out and you reach a fork in the road. One arrow points to Cataract Trail, the other to High Marsh Trail. If you want a nice spot to sit and eat lunch by the river, and if you want to use the bathroom before the rest of the long hike, go toward Cataract Trail. There is a porter potty at the trail head, also.If you choose to snack at the picnic area, you can backtrack and follow High Marsh Trail at the fork, which takes you out of the forest and onto an open stretch where you can see a gorgeous view from the side of the mountain. And then it’s into the forest again! We saw so many different types of fungi- they were so diverse! We also saw small orchids, and bulb plants about to bloom. I’d like to go back and see what types they turn out to be! After switching to Kent Trail, we descended and found ourselves overlooking Alpine Lake, and we met a yellow-bellied salamander close by. We crossed creeks and walked past a Marsh, as well.All in all, the Trail was beautiful and (except for the initial waterfall part) quiet. There were times it seemed like I was the only person in the forest.', 'Great hike with many rewarding views!!', 'Incredibly busy up until the junction than peaceful and hardly a person after turning left to do the loop clock wise.

Took me a bit to get acclimated especially since you start climbing straightaway. Loved the different types of trails you encounter on this loop.', 'I could not ask more for a hike.

You cross through all different types of terrain and surroundings - redwoods, marsh, dry scrub, etc. The lake view between the Helen Markt and Kent Trails was beautiful and very peaceful.

One my favorite one, Covered all most the times, exposed towards top multiple times.\n\nSeveral small water fall and creek running all the way. Very pleasant hike.

There were not many visitors yet. We got the parking quite easily.\n\nI would not recommend this to beginners. It is quite strenous and would recommend some practise before attempting it. \n\nThere are lot of waterfalls and water streams along the path. The path is good to do even on hot summer days given the fact that the path is mostly covered with huge trees and thick forest.\n\nMake sure you enjoy the path at every phase of it. I highly recommend this trail to people who love nature. Last but not the lease, stop and take a look at the Alpine Dam which is nearby.\n\nHappy Hiking !', 'Great hike!

I love the views of other mountains, the lake and of course, the waterfalls! I did not, however, expect that it be a serious climb... BOTH WAYS! Our GPS reported that we climbed almost 2400 ft in 7.9 miles- that's a lot for me. There are very few times during this hike where I actually felt like we were on flat ground.

Either way, next time I plan to mtb when I’m on this trail.', ""I would have given this trail more then 1 star however the recent fires have destroyed the trail. it used to be beautiful. lots of colorful flowers, wildlife, u could see the canyons clear across. now it's just burnt. the trail seems to have disappeared. it's pretty much unrecognizable now. the one nice thing to see was random new growth here and there. if u walk to the right more towards the houses u will see all the damage to the houses and how it jumped one house and got the house next to it. so sad."", 'Beautiful scenery. I’d definitely be back for some more amazing views. We went on a Tuesday morning and there wasn’t much activity which was lovely; however, I wouldn’t encourage anyone to hike alone. We didn’t see any wildlife but we did see dog, and possibly bobcat and coyotes paw prints. Surely this hike is easy to complete, but enough to sweat a little.', ""Very nice trail but the recent fire and drought have left this area in rough shape. I really enjoyed the rolling nature of this loop as it broke up the trail into a handful of short climbs that are just enough to get a little burn in your legs. I don't recommend doing g this hike solo as there a re definite signs of coyotes and mountain lions in the area. The recent fire has left no tree cover and there is only 1 shared area on the entire loop so best not to do this in the heat of the day. overall I enjoyed it and plan on doing it more often before or after work. plan on this hike taking about 1.5 hours to complete."", 'Very calm, not packed in the morning, parking is easy to find if you go early. The scenery is amazing .', 'Easy trail, but pretty with all the flowers bloomed. Not too crowded if you go early but it looked like it was about to be as soon as we finished. My dog also seemed to enjoy it.', 'Mustards and flowers are returning in some areas. The hill west of the Old Weir Canyon Trail was solid mustard plants before the fire but still has a long way to go. Snakes and rodents are starting to return too. This has been one of my favorite trails for decades and still is.', 'Hiked with dog on 3/31/18. The effects of last October’s wildfire were devastating on the park and its many oak trees and other vegetation. But there is also much new greenery and growth. Saw many wild California poppies, maybe more than last year.', 'great trail to frequent.street parking. some parts are burned and rebounding.starting to green out for spring already as well in some parts.', ""We have gone here twice and it has been ok. We are in no rush to return. We have had no trouble finding parking on Hidden Canyon & E. Overlook Terrace. Both times we have taken the trail that heads to the NE and RT is about 3.7 miles. As you enter the trail head there are options to go south and we will need to check that out next time. There aren't amazing views or a cool destination to see at the end of this trail. The trail loops around and it is pretty close to homes at part. It is a decent option since it is not very far away.

Only cactus and the largest trees and bushes survived, and the only wildlife are birds. Hopefully nature does its job and rejuvenates the wildflowers this spring.

This is a moderate trail run for a newer runner where technique can really be worked on.

The trail includes lots of ups and downs with twisty paths,  We went counter clockwise.  I was thankful I brought my poles.  They were useful for the steep down hills and up hills.  Dogs are allowed on a leash, but the trail is exposed to sun with no shade to speak of.  They may get really hot if there is no overcast skies as there was today.', ""Pretty simple, lots of uphill. The markers confused us a bit, bc there's a Weir Canyon, and an Old Weir Canyon trail, but it's so open, and you can use the mansions around you as markers, so getting lost isn't something to fear."", ""Another great time on the trail.

Mine isn't great with hills and there are lots of ups and downs. This trail may have limited elevation gain but that doesn't tell you that you may be repeating the same elevation gain! It's sunny with rarely any shade but such a feeling of being out of the city when on the inner side of the loop. Despite my challenge for the hills, I enjoy this trail. Close to N OC but a real sense of hiking."", 'Nice hike with great views. Just enough of a incline to get ur heart rate up and alittle bit of a sweat going.

Take the ""old"" trail split if you want one quick challenging steep climb. Otherwise, stick to the left to keep it easy. It is especially beautiful after all the rains with its tall green grasses and wildflowers. A few impressive lookout spots/views as well. I also enjoy that it\'s a loop, so you don\'t have to backtrack the way you already came.I can\'t imagine this trail being as enjoyable in the hotter months though, when most of the vegetation will be brown and the trail dusty. Hence only four stars.', 'Easy and convenient trail. Very nice a few weeks after rain, when everything is green!', 'Challenging hike for beginners but the views made it all worth it :)', 'Great hike! Mine was a fast pace hike with a couple stops for water breaks and to just enjoy the view. My hike was with OC Parks so it was a group and we got to go a different route than most people. We started at the Outdoor Education Center, took the IROEC Trail to a gate that opened to the Weir canyon trail. This is normally locked but OC Parks opened it. Here we entered the Weir canyon trail going a couple miles before cutting back onto the Roadrunner Loop. Total miles was 3.8 miles. Took about an hour and a half. Lots of inclines so not the easiest hike but I felt it was the perfect amount and the trail ends rather flat giving you a nice cool down period. 610ft elevation gain.', 'Great for a quick hike and love that I can bring my dogs. Less poop laying around than most dog-friendly trails, which is nice. Thanks everyone for picking up after your pups!', 'Moderate up and down trail through the canyon. Did the loop which ended up being a little under 4 miles. Watch for mountain bikers', 'This was an awesome hike and the views were breathtaking!', ""This is my regular hike route. If I'm able to I hike this trail after work before going home. Lightly trafficked. Be aware of coyotes. They're not seen regularly but I have seen them on occasion."", 'Very enjoyable great hike. Could have more directional signs or maps available. Definitely will do it again!', 'fun but easy hike', 'Nice. Was hot', ""This is a great trail. Lots of different views and grades which make it good for a never-boring walk. The breeze makes all the difference and keeps it cool on warm days. I've seen Whitetail rabbits lizards a road runner and heard a woodpecker. I've only seen one snake and that was a garden snake. The mountain bikers love the trail and there are plenty of them so you just need to be aware turning corners. In early spring there is Sage growing along the trail and plenty of Rosemary. There is a shortcut if you don't want to do the whole loop, you can turn at Deerweed Trail which cuts the loop by about half."", ""I really enjoyed this trail.  It is not flat, and I never felt like the uphill parts were long or arduous. Saw some lizards and heard a lot of rattling in the shrubs.  There was a nice cool breeze today that felt good when walking on the sunny ridge. There were a fair amount of other hikers with and without dogs, as well as a lot of mountain bikers (so keep your eyes and ears open for them!). I'll definitely be back here to explore the other trails in the area.  It took me about an hour and 15 minutes to complete this trail."", ""The trail was beautiful, plus it's tucked back so it makes you feel like your somewhere else. The hike is relatively easy, but it does have a few steep hills. We took our dogs which was what made it that much more enjoyable! Highly recommend this hike."", 'This trail is an excellent beginners ride.', 'Nice day out, some challenging spots if you want or you can take it easy, many people out and about the trail. I did not complete all of it', ""Its a beautiful trail, well maintained, its easy and the view on the top stunning.. i recommend this trail for everyone. Be careful, there's some bikers too."", 'Fun hike', 'My nine year old and I just started hiking and we loved it. He could have keeled going but I was feeling he burn. Definitely coming back!!', ""I decided to start hiking to avoid the dreaded gym cardio. It was my first hike and it was spectacular. I saw one other person on the trail. Great scenic views. I'm in my late sixties and found it to be a fairly easy trek. I'll be returning soon!"", 'Intense, definitely felt the burn but so much worth when i made it to the top of the hill.', ""Great local hike, easy enough to get back into hiking. Dog friendly which is even better.... It's an easy morning hike to feel back in nature"", ""Fun trail! We were more out of shape and this was my roommate and I's first hike. I think it was a good starter hike though it took us about 3.5 hours haha. Views were awesome though!"", 'My group and I had such a great time. So many different trails. We went off the trails and climbed rocks, ran some of it. It was the best cardio workout.', 'i really enjoy this place the mountain views are nice. there several trails all with good views. well maintained trails', 'This hike was pretty intense at times but my friend and I took it slow. It turned out to be a little more than 5 miles for us. There is no shade at all and you definitely need a lot of water. Overall this was a gorgeous hike with amazing views!', 'I love this trail and how close it is to me.', 'Great workout, and beautiful view of city lights at sunset. Trail divides a lot, got turned around the first time out.', 'Loved it went with a friend it was her first hike she got a great workout and the scenery was pretty.', 'mmn', 'Did this hike with a friend on the 4th. I liked this trail because it gives you the cross training type of hike. You have a variety of hills and trials to take. We went for the harder hike this time to the top which was a nice view. I will do this again!', ""This is a fun little hike. Not hard at all but not a walk in the park either. I would suggest taking lots of water and a hat because there is ZERO coverage. Wasn't crowded at all when I went. In fact I think I was the only person there."", ""Did this as my first hike alone and it was great! It wasn't too hard not easy, especially after coming back from a knee injury. Will def. be back to finish the whole thing"", 'Love doing trails back home', 'A lot of hiking through tree groves, either truck or coyote trails. Wonderful view. Steady up-hill climbs.', 'We did this hike in 2012, late summer, it was nice in the morning but started to get hot so if your hiking in the summer, takes lots of water.  Frequent mountain bikers, and they like to hit it hard, so make way!  It\'s not the best for views, but it\'s what I consider an ""urban hike"" being surrender by housing developments on three sides.  Worth the effort.', 'One of my favorite running spots!!! :)', 'I live a few blocks away from where the trail starts- or one of the many places the trail starts. Parts of this are incredibly challenging for both hikers and bikers- definitely not for young kids- but overall, a fantastic place. Is part of an extensive trail system running from Santiago Oaks, Irvine, and Wier Canyon Regional Parks. The system has trails for almost any skill level.', 'This trail is def not for beginners! We had good family fun! ', 'Nice hiking and mountain biking trail.  The initial biking uphill, when going counter-clockwise, is really tough and the downhill singletrack at the end is just like a downhill bobsled.  Hard to beat!', ""This was a really fun trail! This app helped my bf and me find it and made our memorial day really fun! We saw a bunch of red ants and thought we heard a rattle snake but didn't see anything! Great for an outdoor workout!"", 'nice hike. went Easter afternoon. very quiet. I would do it again but this time leave my tiny dog at home. I dont understand why people dont follow the leash law especially with bigger dogs. my tiny dog was attack but luckily I yanked him up like a yoyo.  no harm but scary.', ""Fun hike that you'll moderately feel but won't take your whole day or even your whole morning. Some nice views of the Anaheim canyons but pretty much a dirt trail and hike just to hike."", ""Took me four trips before I felt I understood the whole trail system. Many different access points and options for extending the hike, but without a good map and some hints from John McKinney in his Hike OC book it could be confusing to people who are unfamiliar with the area. Still I thought it was a nice surprise! Depending on where you enter it you can be surrounded by residential development, but then suddenly the area opens up and it seems like you could be miles from civilization. I did the simple loop taking in Robber's Roost the first time. 6.0 out of 10."", 'This is a really good workout to hike and beautiful views. The only downfall about it is they have hardly any signs telling you where to go. We had to just guess at about 6 different forks in the road. Besides that, great hike!', 'Confused this w/ Weir Canyon Wilderness in Orange will have to look more closely at map directions and submit updated review.', ""I love this trail. It's basic, lots of intervals, but so worth it. You can walk it, run it, mountain bike it, take the dogs, etc. Very versatile. One I go back to at least once every other week. All new hiking friends are introduced through this trail. Go early! It can get hot hot hot by 10:00. VERY little shade. An apple helps to quench the thirst halfway through. I go through my water by the end of it. Saw a few snake trails today which I hadn't seen before. Saw a baby garden snake. No biggie. Enjoy it!"", ""I hike this trail at least twice per week. It is a bit hard but so rewarding. I think it is a good trail for even new hikers. It's not super easy, but there are no dangerous spots that require a lot of hiking experience. I see people with little kids or dogs on this trail all the time. Whole canyon is approx. 4 miles around but if you take the left at the 1st fork, you can hike up to a trail called Deerweed. Deerweed ends the same place you start Weir but is only 2.73 miles. BRING WATER. There is very little shade on this trail."", 'DO NOT GO IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY! Worst mistake ever haha. Good hike though ', 'Hiked the entire loop today with my hubby and 10 year old son on 4/22/12. We hadn\'t hiked in a long time and were concerned this would be a bit much, but we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. We passed many hikers, bikers, horse-back riders, and dog walkers who shared the trail with a smile. We started the loop to the right, which took us into a canyon and away from signs of civilization for more than half the hike. Lots of wildflowers, birds, and lizards to enjoy. We didn\'t get started until 10am, so it got warm in places, but cool breezes refreshed us at unexpected intervals. The return of the loop brought us closer to the nice homes in the area, but we still felt far away from the hubbub. This is a great trail for ""getting away from it all"" even though you are still close to suburbia.', 'First hike in years! It was great. ', 'Dog friendly trail. its a good workout with a lot of nice scenery. ', 'good workout. lots of ups and down. will do again. ', 'my first hike ever. definitely a mission but very scenic.  Had a good time hiking here & a good workout. ', ""This trail was a good choice to satisfy the need for a spur of the moment, quick day hike. We took our dog, she loved it... But on a hot day it probably wasn't the best choice for her as there was no shade to help her cool down quickly on her breaks. Other than that, it's a nice little local get away for some fun outdoor exercise. "", 'I have hiked this trail many times. It is a really laid-back hike; nice scenic route. You may spot some wildlife every now and then. The view from the top of the hill makes it all worth while. Like I said, perfect for a Sunday afternoon hike.', 'Great trail. It is challenging and beautiful. The pace of the group is very quick, but Mike falls back and assists 1st timers if necessary.

I prefer to run on the ridge and stay away from the fire road. Love this trail up on the ridge. Come up for sunrises!', 'Nice hike and geat views of mountains.', 'Awesome views of the ocean and Catalina, good workout.', ""This is my favorite after work hike! I don't usually make it to the Nike missile site before the sun goes down, but I usually get within a half mile. I hike the ridgeline in and take the fire road out. Great exercise. Amazing place to be at sunset."", ""I'm laying here after hiking and I don't know if it's the sun or just taking the more challenging parts of trail but I'm tired... lol This is a nice hike. What I like about it is that it is challenging enough to hike/run without being disappointed that there were no ocean views because of the haze. There is no shade so be sure to stay hydrated or hike closer to sunset. This trail is dog-friendly so be on the lookout since some people some don't  pick up after their dogs.The fire road trail is wide and paved in a way that is versatile enough to hike/bike ride and have your dog off-leash. On this particular day it was kind of hazy so I didn't get the clearest views of the ocean but I read that in a clear day you can see to Catalina. Always be aware that not only are there lizards and snakes but also dog poop to watch for. Also know that some of the mountain bikers come down hill quickly so be alert.This was my first time but I found out about it because I wanted a trail that was close enough that I could take the dog with he visits. I like that there is a parking lot but also adequate street parking. Respect the neighborhood and when you visit we shouldn't have to worry about permits when the lot is full. With nice views, a versatile trail and being another gem on the west side I can say that I would recommend this trail for those looking for a little bit of a challenge. Stay hydrated."", ""The best hike I've ever been so far. Amazing mountain views from the 1st minute. Be aware - not a lot shade! Better to come in the morning."", 'Amazing views. beautiful hike. My new spot', ""Great hike to do with your dog. Very mild, but you have the opportunity to make the trail harder by taking the inclines. Bring lots of water, there's not many shaded areas!"", 'Great views of the Santa Monica mountains and the ocean. Not too busy or strenuous but a nice workout. Highly recommended!', 'Did this plus Sullivan Canyon. Ends up being over 10 Miles. Sullivan gets steep and challenging. Lots of mountain bikers. Views at top are nice and refreshing.', '', 'I like this trail - never ending flat road - a must - for a dog day walk - we went with my GSD last month and it seemed that the road never ends.. we never made it to the end - lol) we are going to catch up in a cooler day - because it can be too hot - for a furry friend during sunny summer day .... not too crowded - just a few bicycle riders and a few dog people along the way ..', 'Very easy and scenic, love this trail!', 'easy, good trail, amazing views.', 'Steady incline and mostly dirt trail road up to the Nike missile site which is pretty cool with nice views and restrooms/water. Not much shade other than at the top. Great for trail running and there are several alternate routes if you want some variety. They were gearing up to shoot a movie too.', '', 'This is a great trail to let your dogs off leash! My pup loved the 7.7 mile hike. Elevation gain is very gradual. There is no cover. We were blessed by cloud cover on our way in, and the sun came back out on the way back. Beautiful views. Cool Nike missile site at the top. Restrooms and drinking fountains also at the top. Nothing else on the trail unless you want to duck behind a tree, so plan accordingly.I went on a Sunday and mets lots of other friendly hikers, dogs, and mountain bikers.Definitely worth the drive to the Westside for a non-Runyon off leash option.', 'Definitely a great workout! Lots of elevation change.', 'In and out trail to Nike Missile Site. Either fire road or small trail within the brush can be taken to mix up difficulty.', 'Good for trail running. Wide trail, good ascents and descents, amazing views, not too crowded, and a bathroom and water stop along the trail.  Started from the trail head on Westridge Rd to the Fire Station 109 on Mulholland - 11.8 mile RT.', 'Really loved the view and steady incline. Lots of pups on the trail with friendly owners.', 'This is great and really one of my favorites but this should really be called Westridge Fire Trail. Mandeville has an amazing loop if you take it to the end.', ""Not overly crowded, good for dogs, easy parking. Good walk for length and a consistent incline that doesn't leave you gasping."", 'This is ranked as moderate but its definitely an easier trail. The foot traffic and dog activity wasnt too congested which was great! A lot of mountain bikers going up and down so if your dog (or you!) are skittish,  might not be the best trail!', 'Love this trail! Good for easy (fire road) or harder (ridges) hiking. Fun to get to the water tower. Love having dogs off leash.', 'Love that my dog can be off leash. Lots of space for bikers to pass by. Super dusty and no shade. Can get hot early. Best to walk early morning.', 'Great hike! This can be casual or more intense as there is an additional trail to the right of the fire access road. Fantastic for trail running. It gets hot in the sun so bring plenty of water and try to start before 8am. There is plenty of street parking available.', ""Nice wide trail, not too many other people. Would probably be great for mountain biking or trail running. But the lack of cover and lack of variation doesn't make for the best hike. Nonetheless there are some very nice views."", ""Really liked the setup of the hike. You can get a good workout on the very wide gradual incline for hiking, or you can go off the beaten path and take the biking path for a steep workout. We parked for free at the small parking area (fits about 10 cars or so) near the bottom of the course or there's free street parking. At the top (midway point 3.7 miles), there's a nice rest area with shade, picnic tables, a water fountain, a couple of telescopes (25 cents) for viewing, a tower to walk up to have a 360 degree viewing experience, and a pay phone (50 cents) if you don't have reception or a phone.  It was a great day with my daughter, her dog (loved it), and her friend.  Mountain side is very green and nice to look at during the hike. Highly recommend it."", ""Love this trail...You can choose the lower trail or the higher with the hills.. Make it as hard or easy as you'd like...Beware :O There are snakes out .. Huge gofer snake just chillin in the middle of the trail.. If your planing on taking other trails... I'd love it if you'd check us out on FB Go Hike SoCal and post your hikes there.."", ""Great for trail running.  Plenty of views and good elevation gain with some downhills in the right places.  You can make this into as long of a run as you want 7.4 out and back or 10+ and you can't go wrong on there views up here."", ""Awesome trail with amazing views. You can take either the trail or the dirt road. They cross a couple times in the beginning so you can decide what you're up for. We started on the much more strenuous trail and decided to switch to the dirt road. From what I can tell most people take the road. The beginning of the trail smelled horrible from all the dog poop (I now understand why dogs aren't allowed on some trails.) but don't let that deter you, it stops after a little bit. Overall a wonderful experience :)"", 'A classic Cadillac of California trails. Wide and encouraging travel at cruising speed as you take in the wide open views and enjoy the steady ups and downs. Plenty of room for people walking dogs, running and riding bikes with no concern of collision. Plenty of little side trails to run on as well.', 'Off leash trail with amazing views of Los Angeles.', 'Did the 7.2 mile hike today with my family, including 4 teens/young adults. Great views of the valleys, water and the city. We were fortunate to go on a day that had a breeze. We parked on the Brentwood side (the trailhead off Westridge Road ). There\'s a lot for about 10 cars, but you can park in the adjacent neighborhood. About 3.5 miles to get to the halfway point at the Nike Missile Tower site. We hiked the first 1/2 of the entire trail on the mountain bike trails (all hills... Strenuous!). Took the flatter trail on the way back! People and doggies all friendly on the trail. I recommend to bring a full liter water bottle; then refill it once you reach the halfway point at the old Nike Missile Tower (water spicket, restrooms and benches there), good ""resting area."" Highly recommend this hike!', ""Wide trail, dogs allowed to be off leash (which is the main reason I'll come back!) Super misty/drizzly this morning, so could rarely see into canyon but can't wait to come back when it's clear. Still very pretty!"", 'Good times!  This trail is easy terrain (fire road) with plenty of gradual incline.  We used our GPS and it came out to be closer to 8 miles. Four of us went and took our dogs - everyone enjoyed it.  The views are fantastic - at one point you can see the coast from Palos Verdes to Santa Monica. There is also a vantage point at the top of the trail with a 360 degree view that is amazing. There are trails going off in other directions from the main route so we plan to go back and check those out.  I believe they will be a bit more challenging as they were typically single tracks.  FYI - the parking lot only handles about 10 cars so my advice is to get there by 8:00 am (or earlier) or you will have the additional hike up the hill to the entrance.', ""Not the easiest place to access, but there's a nice little parking lot, it's free, and you can often choose whether to follow the fire road or thinner trails alongside the fire road that ascend and descend frequently.  On clear days there are great views of the ocean and the LA basin all the way to Long Beach."", 'I googled trail runs in LA and was grateful I found this location. A relatively short drive from the 405 @ Sunset, the trailhead is well marked although the lot can fill up quickly if you sleep in. There is street parking but do be courteous of the residents driveways. I chose to run the trail parallel to the fire road and was rewarded with challenging hill climbs and descents that went along the ridge. At the 3.6 mike mark is The former missile site with drinking fountain, bathroom and even doggie water bowls. A lookout tower is a good place to compose yourself and stretch for the return. I also noticed the trail continued north into the valley and for future longer runs will follow it all the way out and back. There is plenty of room for mountain bikers, dogs, runners and hikers as long as everyone is courteous. You are rewarded throughout with view of the Pacific, downtown, PV and the valley and mtns to the north. A well maintained trail recommended even if you have only a little time.  Packed dirt and gravel with little loose rock.', 'Great Hike - no shade, but I started at 7am with a friend and her dog.  It was windy, and therefore, dusty.  There was a bathroom where we circled back down to the fire road.  We took some steeper offshoot up the trail.  More mtn bikers than hikers and the hikers all seemed to have dogs.', ""First time riding a trail. I feel that this was a great way to learn. It was not too easy, nor was it too hard. I'm just starting to get into shape, so the ride up was still a bit tiring for me. It also allowed me to learn how to ride up, and most importantly how to go down hill. I will do this weekly, until I feel confident enough to move to a medium level area."", ""i'm a beginner trail runner & this is currently go to trail for my runs. I like how there's two paths to choose from. One that is easier and harder and you can easily switch between the two trails depending on how hard you want your hike to be. There is a lot of mountain bikers on this trail but thankfully  most of the trail is wide with plenty of space for hikers and bikers to share. The only bad thing about this hike is that there's hardly any shade but the views are great!"", ""Los Angeles offers many diverse hikes, and this is one of the more unique that it has to offer.  One thing that makes this out and back hike unique to me is that you start off with the best view of the hike, which is nice because you also end with the best view.  Most hikes in the area have you hiking uphill until the end where you get your million dollar view, but here you start with it right out of the gate.  You then take a pleasant and well maintained fire road up to the old Nike Missile Site.   The Missile Site has some spectacular views of the area, and is a unique oddity that makes for a great place to stop and relax before your hike back. The hike back is my favorite park because you get closer and closer to the ocean with every step.  My other favorite part of this hike is that it is very dog friendly.  If I remember correctly, you can take your dog off leash as long as they're under your control.  Check this hike out for a fun unique experience. "", ""Based on the reviews, I did the hike by tackling the hills to the base.  It was not crowded at all and it was definitely more fun.  This is the best place to hike with you dog since dogs are allowed off-leash as long as you have control over your dog.  All the dogs we met on the trail was friendly.  However, some owners did not clean up after their dog. Bad dog ownership.. Bathrooms and picnic tables are available at the Nike Missile site.  Free street parking is nice too.  I'll definitely go back!"", 'Nice, steady climb that will burn calories no matter what your fitness level.  If you are more advanced, get off the fire road and tackle the hillside trails that will take you up several more hundred feet to the peaks.  This trail intersects the fire road in numerous places.  The lookout tower at the end has picnic tables and a restroom. My friends and I brought snacks to share and we enjoyed the view.  Great time!!      **if you bring your dog, PLEASE be sure your dog is in shape for this trail!!! We ran into several people that were dragging their obviously exhausted dogs and it was really sad.  Also bring them water and snacks; they require nutrition and hydration just like we do!!!', 'Great trail run. Was able to hit the trail head at 4:30 and get up & down before dark. Great views to PV, Catalina and DTLA looks incredible at sunset. Great, smooth fire road run.', 'Fireroad very crowded', 'Stay off the fireroad and tackle the hills on the way up for a much better workout (and less crowds).  At first the trail can be busy with dogs, bikes and people, but get a couple miles in and most people have given up.  **  3.5 miles gets you to the base, you can then keep going towards the Sullivan trail, or down the other side, many options.   **  By doing the hills and going past the base I was able to get 10m and 2000ft out of an afternoon.', 'Definitely not just a mountain bike trail as the description suggests, like someone said before me, probably more hikers and runners than bikes. I just hiked this trail and though I definitely would not call it one of my favorites it was well worth the trip and exercise. As you start up you have beautiful views of the ocean, coastline, and city, the further you get into the hills you loose the ocean but still in very nice scenery. Once at the top you come to what used to be an old military post that once housed NIKE missile satellites during the cold war I suppose? Not exactly sure all the details of this place but was definitely interesting. There are amazing views (which made the trip worth while) there is a neat observation deck with a stairway going up where you have views of the ocean and coastline, downtown, and the san fernando valley. If you want a little more excitement than just walking the trail there are some more challenging hills and switchbacks that parallel the main trail which are great for biking and/or a challenging run. The main trail is an easy hike but the hike overall is probably considered moderate just because of the distance if you go all the way. Its a fairly long hike so bring water and even a snack would have been nice once we got to the top...', 'Going west from the 405 freeway on sunset, make a right on mandeville canyon, then left on weatridge, go all the way up till you think youll never get there and then your there, youll see the sign and have fun. It was my first time there and its an easy route but u can make it harder. When u reach the end and decide to come back down, go left and ull go up and down and up and down, making the trail alot funner then just going back down the same way you came up. In the begining the trail starts with a climb, so hang in there itll get better on the way back. When you leave make sure its not between 3 and 5 pm, traffic on sunset back to te 405 will take you about 45 mins as it did to me. I liked the trail, will go back.', 'I started from my house in Santa Monica, which added a couple of extra miles, but overall it was a good ride. The approach on Westridge is long and kind of boring. Would have rather saved the energy an driven to the trail head instead. Once on the fire road it was a slow and steady climb with dogs and hikers and a few other bikers around as well. On the way back i noticed the single track along the higher ridge which made it worthwhile. All in all it was a pretty decent ride.', ""Mountain bikes, shmountain shmikes. This trail is my favorite trail-running escape in Los Angeles and there are PLENTY of hikers, runners, and walkers. In fact, I'd put money on there being more non-bikers than wheelers on any given day. \n\nDirections to Westridge entrance: Drive 1.7 miles west of the 405 on Sunset Blvd and turn right at Mandeville Canyon Rd. (across from school playing fields) - Take your first left on Westridge Rd at the 3-way stop sign - follow Westridge 2.5 miles up until you reach the trailhead, which is easily recognizable. (Check parking signs.)\n\nDirections to Old Mulholland entrance: Drive 3 miles west of the 405 on Mulholland - park at end of road and walk up to San Vicente Mountain Park.\n\nThere are several options to keep in mind:\n\n1. It's 3.9 miles from Westridge portal to Mulholland, making a 7.8-mile in-and-out.\n2. The fire road is moderate, but long. Watch out for speeding mountain bikers!\n3. The ridge route is mostly singletrack and parallels the fire road, connecting with it at regular intervals. It's also MUCH steeper and more challenging. \n4. Want more? Extend your hike by continuing down the Old Mullholland fire road (several dozen miles of options)\n5. Want a challenging loop? Start up from the Westridge portal and search for the trail that leads downhill -- it branches off from the first outer turn on the fire road, next to a doggie-poop receptacle. Follow the trail down into Sullivan Canyon, turn right at the bottom, continue up the trail for about 4 miles and then follow a series of switchbacks that lead you up the ridge to the west of the Westridge trail. Turn right at the top and continue for a few hundred yards until you reach the Old Mulholland fire road. Turn right on the fire road and walk a mile or so until you reach San Vicente Mountain Park. Continue down Westridge trail (take the ridge route if you're feeling spunky) until you reach the portal. It's an awesome hike, but it adds a few miles. (Not sure how many, but it feels like an 11-mile hike in total.)\n\nThe trail is open from dawn to dusk all year long, but it can get scorching in the summertime, so plan to go early and always bring lots of water (and food if you're not a masochist). Keep an eye out for rattlesnakes and look for the lovely stone-art installations on the ridge route - they're quite sweet!\n\nAlso, Westridge is dog-friendly and leashes aren't required if your dog is well-behaved.\n\nHope this helps!"", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '',

Bracket Field (and the cafe serves good food too!) \nYou have two options to begin the hike. The first is to continue west on McKinley to the trailhead, or the second is to cross McKinley and follow the fence along the golf course (this option drops down into a small valley and reconnects with McKinley before the trailhead). Today I chose the second option. \nOnce on the main trail there will be some asphalt but as you proceed to Tree Line Trail the dirt dominates... leading you to the south portion which has excellent views of the lake and the San Gabriel Mountains. In the middle of the hike you’ll cross the Puddingstone Dam. I used this stretch of straight asphalt to walk backwards. Why backwards? It strengthens your knees and improves your balance! \nAs you loop the lake there are restrooms and picnic areas and on the north shore, playgrounds and boat docks. And, you’ll share the trail with cyclists and runners... all the while serenaded by honking geese, Happy hiking!', 'I’m not sure if I classify this totally as a trail because over half of it was actually road.

I was there on a Sunday morning, and there weren't very many people on the trail.I would suggest going to the free parking at the east side of the park, near the airport.

The rest of it is for climbers only. While the visitors center heavily discourages bouldering and blazing your own trail, many have done it *cough cough for thrills, and at the top theres a cool circle of rocks that people have put together. You could get to the nearest peak from there, but again it requires trail blazing so be careful (snakes) and mindful (there are unofficial trails, but minimize your foot imprint and dont trample, also dont smoke ANYTHING) *not that I have smoked in mission trails, just seen it and it makes me shudder thinking of one cigarette butt or flying pipe ember can just set a whole place ablaze, so just dont!!!', 'Short but sweet! This is a fun trail that’s pretty technical. We went at 8:00am on Friday and only saw a few other hikers on the trail and a few rock climbers at the crest doing their thing. The trail is quite narrow though so if it was crowded I don’t think I would have enjoyed it much.', 'Short hike, but great views! saw some rock climbers. I wore my hiking boots because I was not sure what to expect, but glad that I did because there was lots of opportunities for a clumsy person like myself to roll their ankles haha. Took less than an hour to complete, which allowed us to take in the view and have a snack!', 'very sad to say...no clear begining... so crowded I could not even enjoy it...for me not a fun adventure', 'took the north entrance to the south and walked back to my car since it was in between open gate hours took 2 pups and we all had a good time', 'Awesome trail!', 'Really fun, and short. I usually go on longer more nature hikes but this was a good experience because of the nooks and crannies you climb through. I would definitely do it again, and if you are looking for a hike in the San Diego area this is a good one to consider!', 'When in SD with my sister, we completed this trail with her Ex. It was amazing! All I remember was it was hard because I didn’t have the proper foot ware from packing lite due to a cross county road trip. The terrain was rocky and steep incline. But the view was worth the ankle rolls. I remember the Rick formations and crossing the fence - Not sure why those things stick out in my mind but they do lol! Go here if and when in SD! I always try to do a hike when traveling and so far I’ve been successful!', ""Rock climbers loops was amazing as well as thrilling. Perfect if you're trying to increase your endurance.

BTW - i highly recommend visiting the visitor center as they have small interesting exhibits ^_^\n\nHIKE: the hike is pretty straight forward with some branching trails at the start but they inter-connect with the main trail.  there's incline and declines but they aren't too drastic UNLESS YOU PLAN ON ROCK CLIMBING/BOULDERING!  \n\nFunny thing - i tried to boulder my way up to the top and almost fell.  so be very careful and have the proper equipment when attempting.  I only had climbing shoes but.  But i'm also a novice LOL.\n\nAnyway, you can choose to not boulder and just continue the hike.  \n\nIt got pretty packed early in the morning so if you're looking for quiet serenity - i'd advise to come around 7AM since there were already a bunch of humans by 8AM.  and since the park offers free nature walks, that just adds to the human traffic you'll need to navigate around.\n\noverall, i'd say this was enjoyable and the scenery was very nice.  i just wish i'd made it to the top but i'll need to up my climbing skills."", 'We started on the Visitor Center Loop, headed down towards the river, then back up, across Father Junipero Serra Drive to the start of this trail (one could go past the gate and park near the trailhead).  The trail was well-maintained.  Nice shade spot at Orange Cube Rock.  Continue up some small switchbacks to rock climbing area at top.  We were too tired (and hot) to try the rocks!  Nice views!', 'Short loop.  from the top you can blaze your own trail to the top of the mountain if you like a challenge.', 'Even if you are not a climber you can still make your way up pretty far on the trail with moderate skills.

Still pretty hot out. Saw lots of rock climbers. Short, sweet, and warmed my legs a little bit. Pretty easy hour or so hike.', 'Loved this trail. Just a shorter fun trail. Definitely not difficult...lots of fun.', ""I wasn't quite sure what to expect based on reviews. It is either difficult or easy. Well my take on it is if you stay right on the trail, it isn't bad. But it's easy to get off just a little and you'll soon discover it appears sketchy. If that happens, pull out your app and see if you are still on the trail. In my case, twice, I was off it just a little. I think this is because some of the climbers have made shortcuts to the base of some of the vertical rocks. There were several climbers today as well.\n\nThe views are fantastic, the trail is interesting, though short. It is a little bit of a workout but at 0.91 miles, it isn't exactly long. However, I parked my car at visitor center parking lot so my total mileage clocked in at 2.25 miles.\n\nI loved it. Plan to do it again."", 'Nice little trail but really makes you work it on your way up.', ""Exactly what it says it is. A great little hike to get you moving and rock scrambling. Wonderful views. You can bring the dog but don't. It's hot now and really not a good idea. The trail is super narrow in parts and you will have to let go of a leash to navigate the boulders. Dog will invariably go off trail."", 'Great rock formations and views.', ""Love this trail, especially around and right after sunset. As others have stated, it's not that difficult, however, if you have short, stubby legs like me, it is a lot more challenging. I found myself using my arms a few times which was a bit different than my usual hikes/walks. Obviously you can complete this trail by starting at either end because it is a loop, if your knees aren't the greatest I would suggest sticking to starting at the first trail head as marked on the map (first trail head coming from the direction of the Visitor Center) so that you're climbing the steeper part and not coming down it."", 'Clean trail. Beautiful view!', 'This was the first place that I hiked when my husband and I moved to San Diego 7 years ago.  Love the intense climb and bouldering that it takes to get to the top.  Great views up there and love the thrill of being on the edge.  We only wish the hike was longer!', 'Quick intense hike!

Its fun.', 'My first California trail and it was a worthy introduction.', ""Loved this! I finished the 5 peak challenge and was feeling very proud at 57 years old with a bad hip. But be warned if you don't enjoy scaling a few boulders or being on narrow paths or are afraid of heights. This trail may not be for you. Luckily my son who's a rock climber lead the way. I've gone back and done it twice this week! It's a good quick workout."", ""My favorite difficult Mission Trails hike. As soon as you get up the climb, it's not hard at all.

Made it up with my 5 year old daughter lol', 'great workout. awesome views.', ""This was a pretty easy-peezy trail, mainly because it's very short. It's still quite a tiring hike, but a great quick workout to start. I wouldn't say this trail was terribly difficult. Definitely seems like a great place to get a good hike up and do some rock climbing."", 'Short fun trail! Cool rocks', 'I like this Trail, has a little bit of everything for the whole family', ""I say backpacking rather than hiking because I usually do this trail with a pack of climbing gear. It's steep but groomed. It's relentless but brief. It's good for a quick pump as a hike or run if you have the strength for it."", ""I completed mission hills 5 peak challenge in a week and was feeling pretty proud of myself at 60 years old. I was walking the path from the visitor center to the dam when I passed by climbers loop. There was a bunch of rock climber repelling up at the top and what looked like Boy Scout troops going up the trail.  I thought what the heck let's check it out and I started up the trail.  This trail is different than all the rest as it's very steep and narrow in places.  It's not all dirt, there are a lot of boulders you have to climb over. I was probably 100 feet from the top when I began to second guess as myself as to why I was trying something so dangerous and turned around and went back down.

By my GPS watch, you will climb a total of 169 feet between 0.2-0.3 miles from the South trailhead. This equates to a 32% incline over that segment of the trail! Nearly the entire ascent on this trail is found in the first 0.3 miles. I think the difficulty in this trail is really the tricky terrain at the top as you traverse past the sections where rock climbers tread. Overall, a good, quick hike that you'll be happy to tell people you completed."", ""I had been eyeing this hike from South Fortuna forever. Finally did it with my 12 yr old and was actually a bit let down. It's not long which I knew, but after you're up it wasn't much of a workout. Had to be careful going over which slows you down. If you're going to hike and be out and about its okay. Not really a good workout though, IMO."", ""Like the previous review.  Short and intense. I haven't hiked in 6wks and it totally had me breathing hard and stoping. I'll go back for a little short training. Rugged terrain and have to use arms and legs to lift yourself up.

The trail is narrow in a good bit of places, felt very dangerous. Enjoyed watching the rock climbers do their thang. Not too many people there today..nice and short hike, but a nice workout for them legs!! Loved it!', 'Short but very fun loop.  Stay clear of the climbers and just enjoy their talents!!  Stay safe!', ""This is one of my favorite climbs. It's near my house, it's a great workout and it only takes about 30-40  minutes to complete. The views are amazing any time of year. The morning is the beast time to go on a hot day because it is in the shade. The trail itself gets narrow in places and can be challenging for the beginner hiker. For a warm up I do the small loop of trail from the dirt parking lot off of Jackson Rd."", ""For the purpose of this review, please assume that this hike is rated 5 stars for three reasons: its intermediate difficulty, its ease of access, and its beautiful views in the springtime. \n\nJust a quick stretch down the main road of MTRP - Father Junipero Drive - and you're at the base of a loop which will have your calves singing as you ascend. I recommend this hike for most people who bring friends on a hike because it's just short enough to get you out of trouble if your friends aren't as in shape as they thought they were, and just long enough to get a good workout in. \n\nSome of the challenges are rock scramble, and the first time I went on this hike I lost the trail three times (it was springtime, with things overgrown) so it could be blazed a bit better but that was part of the fun. Now I let my boys take lead on the hike - they know how to see and be cautious around rattlesnakes, which are a potential hazard anywhere in Mission Trails Regional Park at certain times of the year.\n\nPart of the fun is watching the climbers do their thing (pictures included).\n\nThe 5 star comes from my repeated success on this hike for the basic conditioning of a skilled hiker, the orienteering and trail skill developments of young yet experienced child hikers, and the occasional out of town friend who wants to get out but has a timetable that prohibits a longer hike."", ""I like to add this into my runs because occasionally. It's nice to watch the climbers ball-out too"", 'A group of friends and I climbed as far as we could go. The trail is still closed due to the fires. We had 5 dogs with us and 2 were Yorkies. We made it to the top without any problems. It gets pretty rocky up toward the top. It was a great hike and had amazing views.', 'A section of the trail along the climbing wall has been closed off due to a fire.   The Rangers want to give the area some time to recover.

You walk through a lot of trees and it breaks out into some awesome views at the lakes.  Nice and quiet. Not too many people, but it is late in the season.  You don’t have to get up there super early because the walk is only around 2 1/2 hrs.   Plenty enough time to walk around and relax.', 'Hello twins.  ;)', 'It was absolutely gorgeous. Wish I brought my fishing pole. Passed 5 guys who said all together they caught 30 fish. Great hike.', 'Did an overnight trip this weekend and camped at Upper Twin Lake. Found a nice established camp up the hill on the north side of the lake. Awesome!  Stone fire pit and logs for seating. Several areas to set up tent and a hammock. Perfect weekend! A bit chilly, but worth it!', ""Hiked this trail this past weekend (8/25/18). Started on the road at the Potter Pass trailhead and followed that all the to the Twin Lakes fork. Really easy to follow, no problem at all staying on the trail we needed.  The weather was perfect, which made for a pretty busy trail. Not a big deal to us as everyone was quite friendly.  The smoke and smog from the CA wildfires was not as bad as I thought and probably had an impact on the mosquito activity, we didn't see a single one of those buggers on our whole trip. We ended up going up to George Lake and eventually up to Kaiser Peak."", 'Went by Lower and Upper Twins to George Lake today (8/1). Trail in great shape and easy to navigate. No bugs, mosquitos or other irratants. How lucky can you get.', 'Upper twin lake is a great backpacking spot.', 'Probably the most beautiful, serene so far since moving here in Jan.  2018!! Absolutely NO REGRETS! So many beautiful blooms in the meadows, crystal clear water, just perfect! even the cows along the trail and the log bridge.', 'Beautiful Lakes at the end of a wonderful trail.', 'As others have already said, the trail was great with beautiful views, lakes, and foliage and is well kept and marked. In late July, two of us and my pup made it to Upper Twin Lake where we rested for a bit and then turned back, taking three and a half hours total. At the trail head there is a small parking lot and bathroom making the trail very easily accessible. The trail was mostly shaded with some sunny sections, but the weather was amazing the day we went.', 'Wow. This hike was amazing! I\'m definitely a novice but I saw photos of this place and said ""Screw it. I\'m in"". I took my cute pup and headed out to experience that view for myself. I also tracked my progress with my Apple Watch so you can see exactly how long it took for me to get there and come back (minus the 10 minutes I spent at the actual first lake and a few sit downs to catch my breath or snap a pic). It took me an hour and a half to get there, totaling 3 hours for the whole shebang. I realize that I obviously didn\'t see the second lake (if there is one), so it might have taken me less time than the whole hike is cut out to be. My ass hurts. What a great workout. What amazing views! And the foliage! Ugh. The lake was insane. It was like a movie. My pup and I were the only one there an it was almost eerie how quiet and peaceful it was. Scary almost when you choose to hike alone. I only encountered about 14 other people the whole way. Pretty chill. BUT HARD. Only in that it was the longest hike I\'ve ever done, and I felt that my recent endevours on the stair stepper were no help. I definitely sweated, got winded, and my feet hurt after it all. But ohhhhhh it was worth it. Try it and you won\'t regret it!', 'Did this hike today with my husband, and we both loved it! The bugs were not too bad at all. We ended up taking the trail about a mile further to George Lake, and it is totally worth it! Total trip was 10 miles. Would recommend!!', 'A great hike full of wonderful views. Wildflowers everywhere! The lakes were gorgeous and the fish were biting. Lots of insects but the views are so worth it. Woodpeckers, butterflies, babbling brooks, charming bridges and good balance of sun and shade.', 'Beautiful trail with abundant wildflowers in several meadows.', 'Gorgeous trail. Recommend continuing to George Lake.Only con was the amount of mosquitoes.', 'Awesome!', ""Well laid path and pretty easy hike..  Great Views.. But was windy and couldn't stay for long at the lake and it became very chill. I would suggest to avoid on a windy day. It was 16mph when I had hiked."", ""Beautiful views! The trail is clearly defined & easy to follow, but the dead trees are definitely a hazard that hikers should be aware of. I wouldn't want to hike this trail on a windy day."", ""Just finished this trail mid June 2018 and it was beautiful.  No shortage of snowmelt for filtering water at upper twin, lakes were full of trout that bit all day, days were sunny and warm, and nights weren't too cold.  There was still a bit of snow on the ground, but I doubt it will be for much longer with the days getting warmer.\n\n\nSpent two nights on the south side of the lake and mosquitoes were pretty bad (the only reason I rated four stars instead of five).  Sun hit camp in the morning briefly, it was in the shade most of the day until about 3:00, then it got pretty toasty with not a whole lot of shade, and sun set around 7.\n\nSecond day we hiked to George lake for a while.  Nice and full with a nice little stream running next to the trail.  Lots of snow in the drainages so cross-country from George to kaiser peak is pretty much impossible.  In the end it was definitely a nice hike and some amazing views."", 'Just completed this backpacking trip on 6/2018 with the wifey and our 5 year old.  Moderate hike, had its difficult parts but was very peaceful and rewarding to arrive at the upper twin lake and set up camp. About more than half way we started to see snow which we were able to stop and hang out for a few.  Took us just over 2 hrs to complete.  Will do it again.', 'One of my favorite hikes! Lots of beautiful views. Snow capped peaks in the distance, meadows, streams, lakes, cool rock formations. I saw two mountain quail, a yellow-bellied marmot and there were trout in the lakes. I stuck my foot in the water to see if I wanted to swim but it was very cold (snow melt). I got a little turned around when I got to the Kaiser wilderness sign. I didn’t see the trail right in front of me that goes down the gulch. Luckily I had my gps to help me out. There was still snow on the ground in June on the second half of the hike but not enough to warrant any different gear.Overall a great hike!', 'Great hike! Went Memorial Day weekend and large portions of the trail are still covered with snow. Might want to bring crampons to be on the safe side, but you don’t need them for most of the trail. The views are beautiful! Worth it', 'This twin lakes is also amazing!', 'I did my first backpacking trip on the trail in July 2017. That year the Sierras got an insane amount of snow, so there was still a lot on the ground, which made staying on the trail difficult. That was the only negative thing I can say about this trail. The entire trip was amazing and I’ll defiantly be back once the snow melts.', 'This is my all time favorite place to be.  This was my first backcountry hike and I fall in love with it more and more every time I go back.  Paved trails and easy to navigate.  I personally prefer Lower Twin, but Upper Twin is just as beautiful.  Enjoy fishing in both lakes.  I have also hiked the extra mile up to George which is a nice little lake too.  I love this area.  I absolutely recommend it!!!', 'Easy to moderate only because the snow at this time (11/26/17) made trekking more difficult as well as staying on trial as this was my first time attempting this trail. It took me an hour and a half at a casual constant pace with no breaks to reach the first lake. Beautiful scenery throughout as well as great fly fishing! Would definitely hike again!', 'Great trail. We’ve stayed at both upper twin and George Lakes. Both worth it, with great campsites and views. We made a YouTube video about it. Search Four Feet Up, George Lake. Hope you enjoy!', ""Great overnight with my family this past weekend. It's mid October and there is snow which made the trip more exciting for the kids. I was there earlier in the week for just a day hike and it hadn't snowed yet, so it was pretty fresh! The one thing that became a bit of a nuisance was all the horse poop we had to dodge along the trail. It was everywhere. If you go on an overnight, make sure you stay out long enough to do some star gazing!"", 'Easy to moderate hike. Arrived at the trail head at 8am and it was cold. Fun hike,lots of shade. Lower Twin Lake nice clear water, Upper Twin Lake stunning and gorgeous.', ""Beautiful trail. Moderately difficult due to Potter's Pass. Both lower and upper Twin Lake are gorgeous. Plan for enough time to explore around upper as each side of the lake has great views! Always see dogs on this trail. There was still a lot of snow in July making the trail difficult to find at times but once the snow is clear it is very easy to follow the trail. Potter's Pass has a gorgeous panorama, perfect place to take a quick snack break."", 'Amazing views, fun lakes, shade most of the way, beautiful meadows, rewarding climbs, easy to follow the trail.', ""I did this as a day hike in mid August and it was perfect! So many wildflowers along the trail and the lakes were beautiful. I definitely recommend going on to George Lake if you made it as far as Upper Twin, it's worth it! I'll absolutely be backpacking next time, I didn't want to leave!"", ""The lakes were beautiful as always. Fish were biting, but I wasn't able to catch anything. Mosquitos weren't too bad, we sprayed repellent and they left us alone after that."", ""First time backpacking and we couldn't have picked a better place to go to. It's was a great hike. There's a lot of people on this hike ranging from different age groups. From young kids to older adults. We will definitely do it again."", 'Great Trail. The mosquitoes are relentless, but the view at the top totally worth it.', 'ry accessible and therefore very popular destination. Did a solo overnighter on a Friday night, mid July. Still a lot of snow and water on the trail following this years record snowfall. The upside is the lakes are full and there is running warer everywhere.  The meadows are green & lush with every type of flora in abundance.  There were only a few other campers on Friday night, no issues getting a permit or finding a premier site. Plenty of water to access around the lake for filtering and downed trees and fall are plentiful for easy firewood gathering.   As a bonus the fishing was fantastic for both rainbow & brook trout. All in all a great trip, even as a solo. Give it a shot.', 'No more snow on the trail up to George Lake as of 7/23! really lovely jaunt that I am not sure I would call ""easy"" for the first 2 miles if coming up the Potter Pass Cutoff, but then again, I could have felt the strain due to lack of sleep the night before.Mosquitos are out with a vengeance, particularly around dusk. Camping on a durable (rock) surface got me and the pup out of their way, however.loved the constant water sources at all parts of this trail so I didn\'t have to pack it all in.couldn\'t more highly recommend this trail, whether you\'re a backpacking newbie, experienced wanderer looking for a base before hitting up adjacent climbs, or a trail running nut!', 'Wednesday 7/26. Trail is in Great shape and went on to George. Mosquitos were a little annoying, so be sure to stock up on bug spray.', ""Had a great time! I've never been much of a hiker but that is changing. I'm still getting used to doing this and today myself and a buddy did this hike to the lower twin lake...not realizing how close we were to the bigger one. I think we were just both tired considering we are not hikers and this felt more moderate than easy...to us. BUT it was a great time and we are going back. Hopefully, we will find a camping spot and stay the night if possible. Oh and I even swam, the water was cold but not as cold as the San Joaquin River Gorge water."", ""Awesome trail with stunning views all around. Surprised to see some snow along the way and lots of colorful wild flowers. This is towards the end of July. We crossed a few steams which our trekking poles came in handy. This trail is anything but easy. I would rate this as moderately strenuous. We clocked it 8.6 miles round trip. Both lakes were gorgeous. Don't forget your insect repellents though the mosquitos and bugs were relentless. I would definitely be hiking this trail again."", ""I took my two dogs on this trail, there were several people on this trail but none of them minded my dogs being off leash. The trail length is more like 4.5 miles in, so 9ish miles total. It took us 2.5 hours in and around 2 hours hiking back out. I really enjoyed this trail, it had some difficult parts but most of it is relatively easy going. As of July 22, the trail was really easy to follow with some snow left along parts of the trail. I know some people mentioned in reviews the trail is hard to keep up with but since most of the snow is gone we didn't have any issues."", ""Awesome hike! Our whole family loved this one. Easy, for me, my four yr old not so much. She rode on my shoulders most of time. I would rate it moderate rather than easy. It's probably closer to 8+milesRT. \nBug spray is a must, they are relentless!\n\nMy wife clocked us at 10 miles on Fitbit , but we walked around lakes quite a bit(I'm guessing two miles) ."", 'Trail head was easy to find, with a parking lot and a restroom! We went mid July, and unexpectedly found a ton of snow on the ground after the Kaiser pass sign. Lost the trail more times than we found it. Luckily there were fresh horse prints in the snow from earlier that morning or the day prior. Without the snow this hike would be much more manageable. Only made it to the first lake because we were exhausted. The first lake was beautiful and we were satisfied enough before heading back. My 1.5 year old Aussie had a blast and was off leash 99% of the trail. We will definitely be going back when the snow clears up!', 'Good day hike to beautiful lakes.  Early July still had snow covering parts of the trail, which made staying on the trail tough.   We look forward to making this hike again.', 'Awesome trail, beautiful views the entire hike. after the pass the trail was covered in snow so pay attention to where your going. would definitely recommend.', ""Great trail! Beautiful views throughout and the lakes are stunning! Definitely not an easy hike, though. I would say more on the strenuous side. Also, our final mileage was 8.8 and total time was 7 hours. Bring lots of water and bug spray! The bugs were relentless. There was some snow on the trail (that made for an extra comical hike) and it made it difficult to follow at times. Just look for footprints and horse prints in the snow and you should be able to stay on track. It doesn't make any weird turns so just stay headed straight along where the trail should be and you'll be fine. It was challenging, but well worth it!"", 'Excellent trail', 'Great hike! Still lots of snow on the trail and ice on George Lake.', 'July 8 and there is still piles of snow obscuring portions of the trail. Recommend hiking stick because it can get slippery hiking over the snow especially going up and down the hills. The streams and lakes are full. What a beautiful day!', 'Great view and very easy.', 'Beautiful lakes, dog friendly, one of my favorites!', 'Great for families to spend time outdoors', 'This is a long hike for a day, but well worth it. Bring your fishing pole', ""Great destination for a late summer day trip.  Be warned the 1st half mile or so is probably the steepest part of the day.  Great winding trail through the forest and winding along side a creek you will cross numerous time.  Once you get to the high point of the day @ the Kaiser Wilderness sign the views are fantastic.  To the southwest you look down on Huntington Lake and to your north and east is the Kaiser Wilderness.  From this point it's a scamper down the trail that winds through the rocks to a small trail sign pointing you left to Twin Lakes.  Both lakes are gorgeous high mountain lakes, Upper Twin the larger of the two has much more room for visitors.  Good camp sights are available but it's a very doable day trip if you just want to hit the lakes and have lunch."", ""good hike lots of mosquitoes bring spray but we'll worth the hike beautiful"", 'Disfruté mucho los caminos, las vistas son increíbles. Y no hay nadie, así que tranquilo. Almorzamos en la punta de la montaña, así que fue relajante no tener mucho tránsito de gente.', 'This hike is awesome!  Uphill climb to Potters Pass then downhill to the lakes.   Quite a few hornets in the area, in fact had to leave because our pup thought they would be fun to play with, boy was she wrong.  The climb out was steep but once on the pass, downhill all the way to trailhead.', ""pretty good trail, we clocked it at almost 8.5 miles not the 6.8 as stated above. pretty good incline the first 1.5 to 2 miles in and first 2 miles on the way out. we did notice a very large number of bees along most of the trail. they weren't much of a problem while hiking, but once we stopped to eat lunch they were pretty much everywhere."", 'Trails can be confusing. I recommend taking a picture of the hiking trail at the beginning and protection from wildlife.', 'Good hike. Take a picture of map and protection for wildlife.', ""This is one of my favorite hikes.  I've gone a couple times but haven't made it all the way to George yet.  Next time I'm going without kids or newbies so I can keep trekking!  It takes us about 5 hours all together including the rest stops at the halfway point to admire the view before descending to the lakes and then of course at the lake.  It is pretty intense at the beginning if you are not yet acclimated to the thinner air."", ""Nice trail end up lower lake this time I'd do it again all the way to top next time"", 'Very nice trail. The first half of the return is a bit more than ""easy"" as it climbs pretty quickly, great lakes, nice views of snow capped peaks.', 'Absolutely beautiful! I am not your average hiker! I am in my late 30s and over weight... this trail did not kick my ass like I had thought it would!! I love how it is wooded (for part of it anyway) You have to cross the creek 4 x! 3 of which there is no ""bridge"", so wear your synthetics!! It took us 3 hours going up (we stopped quite a few times)... 1.5 coming back. I definitely recommend this hike!! it was absolutely amazing once we got to the lake!', 'was a bit of gradual uphill on the way but flattened out beautiful Terrain when we got to the first Lake it was stunning but the second one was even more amazing only about a half-mile between Lakes. Dusty areas in the middle of the trail. But well worth it. took us about 2 hours both ways', ""One of my favorite hikes in the area! Makes for a great trail run and it's easy to find and follow!"", 'Excellent hike on great trails passing through gorgeous terrain.', 'Great place for those living in the valley to beat the heat.  Not as far as other hiking choices and not crowded on a Monday in the middle of summer.  Nice to have several options for when and where to stop depending on how long one wants to hike.', ""One of my favorite spots. Moderate backpack and excellent day hike. There is a descent climb as the trail starts, but is basically flat or downhill after Potter's Pass. This lake is popular so don't plan on being having it to yourself, however there are plenty of spread out camp spots so it doesn't feel crowded."", ""My husband and I did this trail with our pups to see how we'd all do for our first over nighter together. The upper lake is beautiful. Many good spots to scout to set up camp. The hike in is gradual incline the first 2 miles, then drops into the lakes. Hiking back up that drop gets the blood pumping with a pack on but the entire trail is great. Went 7/2/16, great clear skies, no tent needed, just some deet! Hardly had to layer up. Maybe got to 50 at night, 80+ in the day. Sun is intense up there. Lots of day hikers on this trail. Definitely a popular place. We will be back!"", 'Hiked this awesome trail back in Oct 2015. Started about 11am and weather was a tiny bit chilly but once you get moving it was perfect. Had lunch overlooking the upper lake. That lake is the most scenic so make sure if you do this trail make it to that one!', 'Easy hike to the lakes. Awesome scenery up there!', ""This trail is great for anyone that has been trying 2-3 hour smaller hikes (3-4 miles) and is ready for the next step. Me and my boy- toy began the hike around 11. The start is a tough incline, but it gets easier on the way up the peak. The lakes are actually a lower elevation, so you drop into them after you have reached the summit. The lakes are beautiful. We added an extra mile to our trip by circling the Upper twin lake. Picturesque views. Friendly people. On the way out of the lake it's the toughest part of the hike. Heading back up the peak is a struggle, but I managed with often breaks. Total time for us was about 5-6 hours. And that's with our lunch break and circling the lake. Our GPS said it was about 9 miles total. For a semi-inshape hiker who is ready for a challenge: Just Do It!!! :)"", ""June 19 2015.  Great hike with a well marked trail, except when you get to the top of Potter Pass there is no sign to tell you which trail to Twin Lakes.  Go slightly left  of the Kaiser Wilderness sign and then downhill.  A rocky trail is evident and that is the trail to Twin Lakes.  Beautiful meadows and vistas along the way.

After quite a bit of research, we decided on Upper Twin Lake as a destination to try out some new gear and to work out some ""newby"" kinks.  It\'s a relatively short hike and not too taxing. There was still a small bit of snow on the ground.  The only downside at all is that the lake was too cold to swim in.  The upside of going this early is that the hike was virtually mosquito free.', ""Awesome trail, well worth the drive from Fresno. My wife and I went June of '12 and there was still a few patches of snow. Would highly recommend to those in the central valley looking for a day hike!"", 'This is an easy hike with great views.

Be sure to hike around upper twin lake and jump off the rocks on the back side. 5 stars! "", ""When driving up the 168 don't stop at the small sign that says Potter Pass Cutoff. It's much better to start at the main parking lot 3 minutes NE where you would do Twin Lakes. This is a major trailhead and you'll find restrooms and information boards. From this point you would hike generally NW for 2 miles to the Potter Pass junction. On your way back out remember to go SE, the main trail to the left. From the this trailhead you'll be at 7300 ft so be prepared to get a good workout. All of the lakes up here are very peaceful & placid. Well worth it. Next time I might make it an overnighter. "", 'Beautiful hike...July and there were still a lot of blooming wildflowers. The signs were a little confusing at the summit and we ended up coming down through Potter Pass...a very nice hike but we were 2 miles from our car along Kaiser Pass Rd....luckily someone who had done the same thing before gave us a lift to our car! The Ranger said it is actually a 7 mi hike round trip so we probably added another 1 to 2 miles. The scenery is stunning and well worth it!!!', ""Justin's wife here! Awesome hike! There are a few of corrections I would like to add. This trail is above Huntington Lake, another 14 miles above Shaver Lake. When we got to Upper Twin Lake, we had gone 3.47 miles, so I would say your roundtrip is closer to 7 miles, not 5.8. Also, horses were on this trail so watch out for patties! Be sure to bring your bugspray, I got a few bites on my legs where I forgot to spray. Be careful that you don't get this trail mixed up with Potter Pass Trail that runs along Deer Creek on your way back.

Nobody can really do much about that. It would be nice if the description had mentioned that there you have to pay for parking (cash only).

There is a new section of trail which you can descend off Table Mountain and make this a loop.

Continue along the rim for another 400 feet and you will come to a depression in the escarpment, follow this down (it is a little adventurous but most people should be able to do this) to the point where you will ""T"" into another trail (this is the climbers trail that goes to the Grotto climbing area, go there for another adventure). At the ""T"" turn left and follow this trail down to the Peoria Flat Road and back to your vehicle. An easier way to do this trail (it a bit less adventurous as you are going uphill in the adventurous section) is to get to the parking area with the toilet either by hiking or vehicle and follow Peoria Flat Road past the locked gate approximately 1/2 mile to a will defined trail that diagonals up and left (you will pass a couple of other indistinct trails on the left but you will know you are on the correct  if you come to a steel power pole just right of the trail after going 300 feet on the trail) Continue up the trail and you will come to a rocky section where you will be hoping from rock to rock, continue past this section to a point where the trail descends into another rocky section.

Due to some of the open area's, this is definitely  a hike you want to do in the cooler months or early in the morning during the heat of the year. It is a good trail to intro young people to trail hiking. Bring water as there is nowhere where you can pump water.\n\nThough Melones area is known for poison oak, I didn't see any on the trail, though it could of been still dormant. Stay on trail, no problem.\n\nAs far as the climb to the top, It's doable for an old fart like me with bad knees and over weight, which is one reason i agree more with the B.L.M map of the area designating this trail a challenge and not moderate. .\n\nI saw people with with kids under the age of 5 and will say that the upper part of the trail is going to be a challenge and do think its a little foolish to bring somebody that young on the rocky trail with steps higher than a foot sometimes. There are some serious fall dangers not only on the trail, but at the top of the bluff.\n\nThe view though, as you get to the top, and on top is awesome. \n\nAs was mentioned earlier, get there early and turn around heading back.

This hike is definitely with your while.', 'It\'s a beautiful hike that is easy enough for someone that hasn\'t been hiking for awhile or just wants an good walk. There are two entrances - the trail actually starts at the first gate. You\'ll walk a little over a mile thorough trees and fields. Once you get to the restroom you can take the trail to the top or go through the gate to the ""watershed"" trail. That\'s a great hike along a dirt road that\'s pretty much flat. If you want, that leads to the dam but it\'s a 12 mile hike. Along the way you see glimpses of the lake. All together it\'s a wonderful place to hike. A few things:1. The road to the second gate is bumpy and you\'ll need a vehicle with a high clearance. 2. If you park at the first gate turn your car around to park. It can be a tight bunch of turns to get out otherwise. 3. It\'s better to get there relatively early in the morning - I got there at 9:00 am on a Sunday morning and there were about 3-4 cars.  By the time I left 2 hours later there were 10-15.Enjoy!', 'Beautiful birthday hike with my teen sons.  It is almost surreal up top with the landscape resembling something you’d expect on a foreign planet.  The views are spectacular at sunset!  For those afraid of the steep/rocky bit towards the top...Just do it!  It’s not that bad.  Take a hiking stick for stability and go slow.  There is plenty of room for advanced hikers to get around you.', 'My whole family enjoyed this hike. The end was a little steep, but my boys (youngest is five) made it up. The view was well worth it.

A couple of tips:1) The trail is not well shaded. So would not recommend hiking during a 100+ degree day (like we did)2) The directions on AllTrails takes you to a trailhead. However, the first part of the hike is flat and basically follows the road. Also very hot and with limited shade. You can skip that first part and just start hiking up the mountain if you open the gate at the end of where AllTrails directs you to and continue driving down Shell Road. There will be another trailhead and space for parking further down near the restrooms3) There is a part that requires bouldering', 'Went with friends, a 7 y.o. and my little dog.

Be aware of the poison oak!', 'The trail starts out very easy and becomes more challenging the closer you get to the mountain face. The worst of it is not very long, but you will find yourself climbing up rocks on a steep hill. However, the view from the top is worth the climb! I would recommend going first thing in the morning as there is no shade up top.', ""Beautiful views when you make it to the top! We went a week ago when it was overcast. Perfect because it wasn't too warm and everything was still green and fresh. We attempted this hike last summer, but it was too hot, dry and it sounded like there were rattlesnake dens nearby. Overall an easy hike, but definitely recommend spring or fall."", ""4/29/2017 HikeThis hike was amazing!  It took us about 3 hours following the trail map here on All Trails plus we added the whole loop circling the perimeter of the plateau.  You get to see some snow caps still on the left side of the mountain (where you come up - there's a fenced up area with a house on private property  which is the farthest you can go on the left).  You will see Chicken Ranch Casino right below too which didnt make the best sight but there were great vistas on the horizon.  The best part is where you see New Melones Lake which is on the right side of the mountain.  Lots of hawks flying around very close to the edge of the mountain, you can almost touch them :)  \n\nOverall, the trail was not hard to follow and you will start feeling your legs burning about 10 minutes right before you get to the top, which is worth every bit!  \n\nParking is on the street and it's limited.  People with all wheel drive are able to drive up to the trail head but the muddy road have major holes - not doable unless your car has very high clearance.  \n\nThe hike in from the street parking to the trail head is just under 5-10 minutes on a brisk walk.  Once you see the restroom (vault and there's only 1) on the right, you hang left across the street from it to start the trail.  We got there at 9 am and there were only a few groups at that time.  On the way down around noon, there were loads of folks going up and it would've made the trail incredibly crowded and loud.  \n\nHighly recommend this one, just be sure to be an early bird."", 'Great hike with beautiful wild flowers. Hard to find and  not much Parking- easy to miss the trail- we got lucky and followed some that knew the trail. Not too hard.', ""very easy until you are almost at the top and then it's worth the push over the last 5-10 of step climbing up the rocks.  Great views as promised."", 'Great hike! Took my dog with me and she did great. It was easy to get to the top and the trail was easy to follow. Parking kind of sucks, but other than that it was nice. Beautiful this time of year!

There were very few people out and my friend and I had an eerie feeling the entire time we hiked. AllTrails was super accurate about the trail head and parks, so we were able to find the location very easily. Photos included one of a lake, so I thought we would run into one during the hike, but soon realized it was actually very far away. It's was difficult to stay on trail, as there were multiple trails intersecting. This is not one we would attempt again."", 'good trail and great view.', ""Nice quick trail. From the start it looks impossible to get to the top of the mountain but it wasn't as hard as it looked. The view from the top made the rocky climb at the end worth it. The map here was perfect ... got us straight to the beginning of the trail. Not a summer hike as I predict it being really hot, I went on a cloudy fall day and it was perfect"", 'The trail is easy to follow, not too technical and views are great. Table moutain really looks like a table top! Highly recommended', 'great trail', 'Very dog friendly, cool caves, and great view from the top. You can make this hike longer by adventuring around the top of the table top mountain.', ""I liked this trail. I want to come back in the spring when everything isn't so dry. I will say even though its dog friendly, I'm not sure all dogs could handle the rocky terrain towards the end. I am 25 years old and I was pretty scared to climb the end haha. Like all other reviewers stated, its totally worth it though. Its beautiful at the top. It definitely is an intermediate trail, but very enjoyable. I went really early in the morning since its now summer and it gets very hot so starting at 7am is ideal in summer. It's great for those wanting a challenge than your regular run of the mill trail. It is a little challenging finding the right way to go once you reach the rocky portion, but it didn't take long to figure out the way."", ""It wasn't what I expected. But, then again I went on a very hot day in June. It was a lot of dry grass and thorns everywhere. The table mountain is a great view but wouldn't do it again."", ""Enjoyable walk through beautiful California tall grass and oak trees.  That's Part 1, and Part 4 on the return since it's a loop.  The 500' climb (Part 2) is rocky and steep but a modest effort rewards the hiker with a stunning 180 degree panorama of a long treeless ridge and the reservoir down below.  Up top is a rocky plateau, stark and barren. The view is remarkable and a real highlight, even on the same weekend I walked off several stunners in Yosemite, about an hour away. Part 3's descent is a little tricky, so watch your step!  This week a flood of purple wild flowers dotted the golden tall grass and provided a nice visual contrast of colors.  I saw several native birds and 3 wild turkeys down below, and some buzzards up on the ridge.  Very hard to locate the trailhead.  Park at the end of the road and look for a gate and trail sign around on the right side."", 'This hike was fun, especially once you are getting closer to the top. Definitely a moderate hike. The views of the cliffs as you start your hike are pretty cool, and the view at the top is beautiful, especially now that the lake has a little more water. Parking can be tricky. There is no parking lot so you just have to find a spot near the entrance which is a residential area. To find the beginning of the trail head to the metal gate and look to your right. The trail begins right behind a tree/bush. The sign is not visible from the street.', 'This was a fun trail especially the last part to the top. Definitely a moderate not an easy. The view is well worth it on top.', 'The view was amazing!  The climb was a little tough with 2 dogs, but it was all worth it once we reached the top.', 'Absolutely incredible.  Pictures can never do this place amy justice. The view waiting for you at the top is well worth the hike.', 'one of my favorite near by hikes... amazing view, work up a good little sweat... wear good shoes and watch your balance!', ""Great hike. Got a little lost but honestly, just follow the crowd and you'll be fine. Beautiful view!"", 'I imagine springtime is the best time for this hike. Everything is so green right now. The bathroom is perfectly placed. We chose to walk through the meadow that parallels the dirt road and found it very scenic and peaceful. The last bit of this trail before reaching the plateau is very steep and rocky, a challenge for this semi-fit 50 year old. I was very pleased to have persevered as the view from the top was a satisfying reward.', ""BEAUTIFUL hike. The address in the app is spot on.  It has enough challenges to know you enjoyed a nice workout and enough areas that are easy walking.  We took 5 kids ages 10 to 13 and they all loved it and did it with ease.  It's rocky up at the top but just take your time and use the rocks and trees as your friend to help you along the way.  Had lunch at the top and then enjoyed the trip back down.  Yes, you're in the direct sun some, but there's lots of shade as well. We will definitely do this again!"", 'loved it and the hills were so green', 'this was a great hike! We parked before the gate to make it a tad longer for ourselves. As others have said, the walk to the bathroom is easy and very flat. Then, the next miles is quite uphill, but still doable :) We were a group of 4 with ages of 17-52! We brought a yummy lunch to have at the top!', ""Nice hike.  As another stated, it's not a loop though.  We went when the temp was 68 or so and it was perfect.  Can't imagine in summer - too hot.  When you park you can choose to walk the road (on private property, but allowed) or make a sharp right just before the gated road and take the actual trail.  It's clearly marked but yes, you do need to look right.  I'm glad we took the hike path - it went through some very beautiful meadows.  Very different than the uphill, rocky hike that lies ahead...so you get the best of both worlds.  If you do choose the road thought it is a bit shorter.  The hike is diffidently up hill A LOT and lots of rocks that make the actual path a bit difficult to follow (but not too tough) but it's not too hard at all and it's beautiful at the top.  We had ages 45, 18 and 11 and we did just fine!"", 'Awesome view at the Top.... Amazing and fun hike. Take plenty of water, gets hot! :)', ""A great hike, but this is NOT a loop as the site suggests. It's about a 4 mile roundtrip hike, so 2 miles to get to the Table Top which is worth every step of the way. The first mile is relatively easy. The second mile is where the fun part starts - the uphill climb to get to the Table Top! This is not an easy hike and definitely not good for very young kids. We took one of our boys (10 y/o) with us and he did great, but any younger than that would be a tough task. None of the areas are dangerous, but they can be difficult to traverse. Some areas are slick, plenty of rocks, and part of the path is not clearly marked. As long as you keep heading UP, you'll be in great shape! This is a hike you want to do with plenty of water, a snack and on a mild weather day. We went the end of March 2016 and had some great weather (60's temps). We will definitely do this one again - fantastic views from the top of Table Mountain!!"", 'An easy hike, and beautiful views. Worth the trip. Hike to the top (the table) and explore the beautiful country landscape, wildflowers, lava rocks and amazing views of the lake on one and Tuolumne mnts (twds Yosemite I think) on the other side, and the west view to coastal mountains. Beautiful dayI will be back.', ""To begin with, do not listen to the directions provided by google. They are wrong. It will lead to two hours wandering on some land looking for a trail head, then giving up and going back to your car only to find a note on your mini van saying that you are trespassing. Come to find out, the trail is actually on Shell RD. And the trail is much easier to find! I went on a Saturday afternoon in February. It was so hot. I do not at all recommend going on a hot day. Or a rainy day/ after a rainy day. Honestly the trail is Moderate. Im not sure how children, yet alone this older man were able to complete it. My eighteen year old body along with my three other teen-aged friends were struggling. The last little bit getting to the top was the worst! It was a mix of large steps and kind of lifting yourself onto big rocks.. Intense! Overall, the view was amazing! You really feel like you have accomplished something when you're on top! In conclusion, I recommend this hike and to go on dang shell rd, NOT perrys ferry or whatever the directions tell you to!"", 'Beautiful view,', 'This trail should be rated as moderate difficulty, due to the scrambling necessary just before reaching the top of the mountain. The hike is worth the views from the top of Melones Lake.', 'We started at the gate before the horrific dirt road that will destroy axels all day. The trail at the gate is nice almost completely flat meadow trail to the main trail head. There is a pit toilet there at the trail head (2nd parking area) before the accent. The climb up was not too hard at all, fairly short, though as soon as you start going up, there is a split, we went left, trail seemed better traveled. A small part of the trail is scrambling, no big deal at all, just keep your eyes on the trail.  The view from the top is amazing looking at New Melones Lake, watch your step you are walking on ancient lava rock. A very good tril for a morning stroll.', 'Drive through the ""residents only"" part of Shell Rd. It ends at the trail. There are two gates. You can start at the first gate where the trail head is or you can drive through to the second gate near the bathroom. The first part of the trail from the trail head to the bathroom meanders away from the road, is pretty flat and is in direct sunlight. After the bathrooms, you\'ll come back to the road where the second gate is. The trail marker is straight ahead. It gets pretty steep from there on up but there are switchbacks. When you get to the fork by the old mine, go left. Last part is a bit of a climb over lava rocks. Views from the top are awesome.\n\nWe completed this trail in 90+ degree heat. It was pretty miserable on the way back after the bathrooms. I recommend either starting very early (we started at 10:30) or doing the trail in fall or spring.', ""I'm wanting to start walking to get in better physical condition.  So, I parked outside the gate.  If you're more interested in the views from the top, and not so much the walking, then drive through the gate--stay on the road--and park near the bathrooms, about a mile away.\n\nA sign says Private Property.  You can open the gate and drive or walk through, but don't get off the road.  After a mile or a little more, you'll see a bathroom to the right, and a few receptacles for recycling water bottles, etc.  Across from the bathrooms is a trail going up to the top of Table Mountain.  Myself, I continued straight past the bathrooms, walking a total of 2.3 miles from my truck.  As the trail began to deviate away from the mountain, I turned around, walked back to the bathroom area, and hiked up to the top.  \n\nAs you get half way up, the trail will go right, or left.  Go left, and after a short distance, you'll see an arrow pointing up the hill, to the right.  Take that way, following the switchbacks up.  Once at the top, you can pretty much go anywhere.  I walked a little to the right to look back towards New Melones Lake, then walked across to look towards Hurst Ranch.  Then walked along that far side, eventually crossed back to the lake side, and walked back.  I only went about a mile, up top, but you could walk as much as you wanted, up there.  Nice views!\n\nA biplane flew by, and waved!  The hike back down and to the car is the easy part.\n\nBe sure to bring water.  It's May now, and wasn't too bad.  I imagine during the summer months, it'd be very hot, and there's little shade on the close end of the mesa.  I don't know about the far end.  Plenty of shade just off the mesa, on the way down.\n\nNext time, I might bring binoculars."", 'Fun trail, great view at the top!', ""I've been up here a few times. Found it easily on my first attempt. There's a gate on Shell Road and usually a few cars parked in the wide space there. The foot path starts on the meadow at your right, continues south for .75 mi and eventually crosses  the road and up the side of the mountain. It's a little steep but only for about another .75 miles or so. It was exciting my first time up here because you can see Table Mt. from all around the Jamestown area, but before the internet,  I didn't know where the trail was. Table Mountain is a huge area and it is one of the  best known geographical landmarks in Tuolumne County. It was once a fantastic river of lava hundreds of feet deep. After eons of erosion, the country side  washed away and now the old river of rock stands alone above the ranches and rolling meadows running  for miles across the county. Once on top you can explore and wander for hours. The description says 2.7 mi /1 hour, but that's not accurate. Give yourself 2.5 hours or longer to enjoy the different views on all sides. Wear decent hiking shoes if you have any because you will want to protect you feel walking across the lava cap on top. I give it 5 stars because it's a nice trail that's easy to find (once you know where to start), it's close to town and such a cool place to explore that some locals are addicted to this place. I also saw a couple people with climbing gear in the area too, so I know they practice on the Mountain if you're in to that."", 'March time of year is a great time to do this hike. Not to hot and everything is green. A little incline to the top of table mountain but well worth it. On one side you see Melones lake and on the other side you see James town. Table mountain is old lava flow but wild flowers still bloom.', 'I have been coming to this one for years. I love coming up in the spring because on the table top the wildflowers are outstanding along with the view. Hubby and I pack I light lunch and like to picnic up there. Plenty of exercise for us and our dogs. A good place to let them run off leash. We live close by and it is handy. The only drawback is the foxtails in the summer and fall.', 'Did this hike for my birthday! Breathtaking! We started from the first gate (this however was hard to find because the road you drive down says not a through road, residents only very confusing) we went in early March am the weather was beautiful 70\'s. at the end of the lower hike we noticed a fork in the road. We took the one to the left it was nothing but rocks covered in moss. (Had I not brought my dog we would of finished this hike too) we got to a point and looked up and people were climbing (with harnesses) the mountain. Finally we turned around and went to the right of the fork. You go UP UP UP. A lot of switchbacks but once we made it to the top it was all worth it. There were a few families with children ranging from ages 4-teens. The hike back we walked the ""off-road"" drive some people drove to the bottom of the hiking trail. I would take it unless you know how to drive 4x4. Some people had a blast the mud tracks were as deep as my knees! The entire hike too us 1-1.5 hours max. And we spent a good 30 min at the top enjoying the views! We will be doing this hike again. However NOT in the summer it would be way too hot and dry! ', 'I just moved to the area and walked this trail with my family and two young kids under 6. Although it has some hills, the young kids did great. The water was very low and the grass brown.  It is very beautiful and we all enjoyed it a lot. I would do this trail again.', ""Great trails for various fitness levels.  Took my nephew, nieces, and a group of their friends and we all had a blast.  I myself am not in great shape but found the lower trail  perfect for my fitness level.  It was challenging enough but not too rough on my knees or back.   My teenage nephews went on the higher and said there were a couple of steep sections they knew I wouldn't be able to handle but they loved it themselves.  Very pretty views!"", 'My personal favorite spot to go for an easy hike, well worth it for the view!!', 'Nice two hour hike close to home. Middle part is semi strenuous, rewarded with great views of Melones Lake and the Jamestown area. The friendly horses just add to the fun.', 'Nice long flat trek through a meadow, then an increasingly steep path up to the bluffs. Halfway up the steep part is a really cool old miners cave and on the way back some friendly horses came seeking attention from us :)', ""This was one of my favorites. I didn't like hiking along the dirt road to the car. It's not fun to be passed by jeeps and 4 wheel drives. Next time I'll stick with the path.  Climbing the mountain was easier that I thought. Lots of shade and switchbacks."", ""This is a great trail. If you want to avoid damaging your car, park at the gate.  If you have a truck with really tough tires, you can open the gate, drive through, and park at the base of the mountain by another gate.  The road in-between the gates is EXTREMELY rough terrain though, and cars and trucks alike have blown tires there trying to drive between and over sharp rocks.  The walk from the first gate to the second isn't that long. It's flat and scenic.  If you walk along the road, you see more horses; if you take the trail to the right of the first gate, it leads you through more scenic territory.  Either way is nice though.  One caution--if you're going there in the summer, go early; it gets REALLY hot there in the afternoon."", ""We started this hike near the front of the first gate and walked through some nice pastures with horses. The fields were filled with wildflowers and was beautiful. The actual ascent to the top of table mountain was not too bad. There are some switchbacks, but they do not get too strenuous. At some point there is a fork in the trail with the less step trail being blocked off by some large branches. I don't know why the less steep path was blocked off, but we ended up just taking the steeper path and eventually reached the top. Towards the top it appeared a landslide occurred some time ago, and you actually have to maneuver your way through them. Overall, the trail was short, fun, and fairly moderate.  "", 'Great trail...varies between dirt and rocks. View from the top was well worth the time.', 'This is a great trail, with stupendous views once you get to the top of the butte. The last 50 yards are fairly strenuous, you have to climb over basalt rocks, but it is by no means impossible. Just make sure to wear the right shoes, and perhaps carry a stick to help with balance. I would classify this as a dry weather trail - it is steep in places, and would become quite slippery and treacherous after rain. I would also suggest that people carefully time when they go up, say mid-day at the latest, as the sun sets behind the mountain at about 3 pm (during the winter at least), and the trail gets quite gloomy thereafter. I would also advise caution about driving in to the trailhead from the first gate, as several reviews suggest. The road is quite heavily rutted and full of rocks in places, so unless you have a high clearance car, you could easily lose part of your undercarriage. I would guess the road would be particularly treacherous and muddy after rain, so I would advise that you just plan on walking the 1 1/2 miles to the trailhead - it is is very pleasant, and the horses are quite friendly.', 'cool trail. great views when you reach the top. if you search around near one of the first switchbacks you can find a cool mine. its kinda in the trees.', 'I love this trail! Its close enough to drive to and offers GREAT views of both the West (Melones) and East (Groveland-Yosemite). I enjoy the early fall on this trial for cloud covered skies and beautiful sunsets. The spring is great for wildflowers. I like to use this trail as a quick training run. Its short, but works really well begining with a slight grade and then jutting abruptly upwards on the rock run to the top.   ', ""Wow, what an awesome area! The hike was quite a cardiac workout but if you can climb uphill and also over quite a few rocks you will have no problem! The view at the top makes it all worth while and from one edge there are lava rocks so plentiful it looks like you're on Mars and on the other you can see Jamestown! The wildflowers were in bloom and we had a lovely picnic!"", 'We do this hike every spring, at least once.  It is one of the most beautiful place for wildflowers in Tuolumne County.  You can park at the first gate at the end of Shell Rd. off Rawhide Rd. and walk the dirt road or the trail which borders the road.  The road is never visible and the trail takes you through oak woodland.  Once you arrive at the ""bottom of the mountain"" there is a vault toilet available.  From there it is pretty much straight up, with switch-backs and a few somewhat level spots.  Near the top the trail is somewhat rock climbing and you need to be careful not to fall.  It is however, worth every step!!', 'We decided the night before to go check out this little hike. For someone that has pretty much been a couch potato for the last couple of years, it was a decent workout, especially with the steep climbs and switchbacks. The view from the top was awesome. Overall, it was a great get away for a few hours.', ""This is a great trail for late autumn or early spring. It gets very hot in the summer time so for that reason combined with the snakes, I wouldn't even attempt in the summer. Its an easy trail about 3/4 the way up. Im in good shape so the switchbacks at the top were a non issue. Once you get on top you get a great view of Melones Reservoir on one side and the highway 108 corridor on the other side which gives great views of Jamestown and the high sierra peaks. I have been up here 4 times an one time had hiked on table mountain 5 miles to the West. It basically looks all the same don't waste your time. Once you are up there you are looking down on the hawks soaring below you.its actually quite incredible. There are a couple of geocaches on the top as well which are all fairly easy. "", 'This is a great hike that also doubles for a great work out.  There are some areas that would be considered climbing but only for a short duration near the top. (tip)Once you get to the end of Shell Road open the gate and drive to the trail head. The hike from the end of Shell Rd is pretty boring so get to the heart of the hike.  You will know you are there because there is a restroom. At the top of Table Top the views are spectacular.

Be careful about not missing the parking lot. Take a look at the map and use common sense rather than blindly following the driving directions through the app. I enjoyed this trial because of the elevation gain. You start huffing a puffing! I’d love to try camping down there.Part of this trial is a more popular because it intersects with Battery, the photo location everyone takes the quintessential Golden Gate Bridge photo at. Walking to this lookout spot after Kirby Cove is a must! Don’t worry, you won’t miss it.', 'Such a great trail and kid friendly too, beautiful scenery', 'Stopped by hiking up Conzelman. Nice little, cozy spot with great views of GG Bridge', 'Great hike with great views of golden gate! Make sure to stop by Battery viewpoint! You fee like you are touching the bridge. The beach at the end is awesome! There were a few people there which was super nice :)', '', 'Fun easy little hike', 'Gorgeous views. Awesome beach at the end. Almost no people. A lot of picnic tables with spectacular views.', 'Great hike to bring people from out of town. It’s easy & gorgeous! Makes for great memorable pics.', 'This was a quick down and back hike .8 miles each way. My dad and I took a long lunch break on a Friday for this route. going in the middle of the day made for easier parking and it wound up a perfect break from the work day!', 'At first you go uphill for about 1/2 a mile and then you start heading downhill. You end up at a beach which is BEAUTIFUL! Coming back the road is steep, but not difficult.', 'Love this hike, and I’m biased because it’s where my husband proposed. ❤️', 'I love this easy hike ! The birding is really good I saw a blue heron here last week. You can access several trailheads from here as well.', 'Easy walk down to the beach. You can book to camp there too. Finding parking on top was a pain since there’s  very limited space. There was no swing when I went.', 'The most amazing views! Walking down is the easy part because it’s all downhill but going back up is a little more challenging! I would definitely recommend this to everyone.', 'Simple walk dwn. Would like to book the campsite next time I go also there was a swing there that was pretty cool to take pics on', 'Great view of the bridge and water access. Highly recommend', 'Great views, and wild fennel all along the trail.  Smells amazing! Pretty easy hike!', 'Such a beautiful hike. well worth the views!!! I am in no way fit.... just started hiking recently and actually found this one pretty easy.....', 'great out and back. fantastic views', 'Tremendously peace view from the shoreline adjacent to bridge', 'So gorgeous! There are amazing views of SF, the bay, the beach, and Sausalito. I’d recommend getting there early enough to find parking as it was intense by the time we left (about 1pm). We ended up adding a couple miles to our trip by adding the Battery Spencer Trail to the day as well as exploring a couple of the old batteries which I definitely recommend. As a Bay Area native, the views never get old and if you’re local and you haven’t been, I hope you do. Trail was about 40-50% shaded so prepare for that if your fair otherwise it requires very little planning. Great place to take visitors! Keep in mind you can only access the parking lot from the south so if you’re coming from Marin, you do a bit of backtracking - unless I don’t know a secret way to get through... which is entirely possible!', 'Beautiful', 'Amazing hike with great views.', 'Great view', 'Easy walk down & back. The hardest part is finding a parking spot!', ""Nice hike, very easy.. more of a walk. If you have shoes with good tread and well balanced... I recommend going straight down the side in the trees. You go off the path by the first turn to the right and just continue down the hill. You'll have to shimmy about 10 feet down a steep incline at the beach but makes it adventurous and great on the legs."", ""As far as hikes go I'd give this a 2. It's a smooth, wide road. However, this is an amazing place to take guests of The City. From the cliffs of the headlands, through a eucalyptus forest, and down to the beach. BTW, the swing has been cut down"", 'Hiking trail is easy to follow, not too many people here which is great, quiet little beach at the bottom as well. The swing was broken when we got to it. Overall, great experience', ""Easy hike. It's basically a dirt paved road that leads to the bottom where the campgrounds meet the ocean. There is parking right at the entrance, but I preferred getting more of a hike by parking at the round about up the hill, and taking the small trail that hugs the road all the way down to the main trail. This is definitely one of those hikes you don't need to wear hiking gear for. Many tourists, families, and photo shoots happening around."", 'Wonderful hike to do with kiddos.', 'Short walk/hike. Great view of the bay and bridge! Nice picnic area if you want to spend the day relaxing by the ocean ', ""Short hike to some beautiful scenery and in my opinion, one the best views of the bridge you can get. Go through the campgrounds, come down the stairs to the beach, and look to your left. You'll find the Instagram famous swing of Kirby Cove. A must - get photo opp."", 'Awesome hike', 'Nice and relaxing beach!', ""It's a small trail and definitely worth going for the swing and the beautiful golden gate view"", ""An urban hike with an awesome finish!  As long as you don't mind a 20 mile round trip hike, this is a great one to experience the best of San Francisco urbanism to one of the best views of the bridge!  And bonus points if you get to Kirby Cove at sunset!"", ""Great Easy Hike. You won't want to stop taking pictures. Beautiful views from all angles."", 'Amazing', 'Love it!! Best time to go is in the morning !!', 'Beautiful and fun! Great on a hot day with friends!!

Bring good shoes for the uphill sections!', ""Great trail! We ended up here much later than planned because it took us two hours to go 26 miles:( So we ended up getting here right after sunset and we had to park a mile away from the trailhead so added two miles to our hike. It was nice parking up at the parking lot further up the hill because you have a pathway along the road with a guardrail between you and the road the entire way and this allows you more views of the bridge during the extra hike. The trail itself is an easy wide dirt road that leads down to a campground next to the beach. It was one of the best views I've ever seen of the Golden Gate Bridge:) And the swing is the reason to go. We walked back in the dark but felt safe the entire way since it was a wide path and had the glow of the bridge to guide us. Lots of raccoons!:) We are looking forward to coming back during the day."", 'Fun! Great views! Easy!', 'This trailhead is at the entrance of the Golden Gate Bridge overlook so it is always crowded at the top. Park your car and hike this trail down all the way to the beach you would have one of the best views of the bridge and city skyline around!', 'Easy trail. Nothing special .. But worth doing because of that swing with an amazing view on the Golden Gate Bridge !', ""This trail was great and not too long. About a mile down and you'll see campgrounds where I believe you can camp during the summer months. Walk through those and you'll end up at the beach! There's a swing on the edge of the beach with a gorgeous view of the Golden Gate Bridge. There are bathrooms down by the campgrounds since they're campgrounds, so you could bring a picnic and spend all day down there!! Soooo beautiful."", 'Great stroll down to the beach and ocean. Bring a geologist (or a book) and admire the special and beautiful radiolarian chert that abounds. View of the City is pretty nice too !', 'It started out a foggy summer day, but the fog cleared and we strolled downhill to Kirby Cove.  Great views of the Presidio area, the Golden Gate Bridge, a nice beach, several nice campsites, and not crowded like the rest of the stops along the Marin Headlands road.  The walk up is a bit tougher and gives you a great workout... would be a great trail run.  Would also be a great place to tent camp for a night.  We had a great time.', 'this trail is amazing. you can also do day camp in this area. while at end is like a secluded beach area, where there is a view of the golden gate bridge and city. this was a continuation hike from my hiking group.', ""I've hiked this many times and always drive away with a smile on my face.  Since the entrance is at the Golden Gate Bridge overlook you'd think it'd be crowded all the time, but it's not.  Even if it's a crowded Fall day, don't be deterred by the crowd up top because they rarely go further than 10 feet from their car.  Once you get to the bottom you'll have one of the best views of the bridge and skyline around!"", ""Beautiful, peaceful campsite just a stones throw from the center of SF.\nReserve one of these highly sought-after campsites  and you'll be falling asleep with the SF skyline in view. You can even drive right down the access road with your car to properly set up a over-the-top campsite. \nSure, it's not the most 'out there' destination, but I know people who've camped out and made it to work on time the next morning in SF."", ""Short and sweet; sun and shade; views and beach.  Park in the small lot for the Battery Spencer lookout.  The trailhead is where the dirt road to Kirby Cove meets Conzelman Road at a locked gate.  The Kirby Cove Road is occasionally used by vehicles with access to the gate's code, so be careful walking around blind corners.  The hike is a mile-long steady descent to a small beach near the north tower of the Golden Gate bridge.  The views of San Francisco are spectacular.  The city feels near and distant at the same time.   The first two-thirds of the decent one is exposed to the elements, but the last third is under a canopy of pine and eucalyptus trees.  The trail divides near the bottom and takes you to various day use picnic areas, an old gun battery and the beach.  There are several areas to explore, but watch out for poison oak.  "", ""Trail doubles as the road to the campsite.  Well maintained.  You'll have to leave the dogs at home.  The five stars from this trail comes from the amazing views of the Golden Gate.  The trail ends at a secluded rocky beach, that has a World War II gun/look out concrete skeleton structure, and the best views of the Golden Gate you can get!  I rated this as moderate because the trail on the way back up to the car is all up hill.

Yes there’s trash and graffiti, though not as much as described in some of these reviews. There may have been a clean up since they went. Once inside the cave there isn’t too much trash, but the graffiti is all over. There are also pigeons inside, which startled me at first then was really cool to watch them fly back and forth. It’s kind of a scramble to get to the caves. Just a somewhat steep walk to get to the entrance but if you want to go inside you’ll need to scramble a bit. It was my first time here and I did this alone so I didn’t make the climb to castle peak - I didn’t want to risk a free climb, even as easy as it is, by myself so I just turned back around. The scramble down is spookier than up. There’s a bit of traffic but parking is easy. Just park in the neighborhood on vanowen and the entrance is right there. I saw two couples, three dirt bikers, and two or three individuals hiking like myself. If you like to hike alone I’d say go around 7:30 am so the early crowd has left but the later morning crowed hasn’t quite arrived. Over all - it was beautiful and I’d do it again.

It reminded me somewhat of a cathedral interior; the temperature within was very nice and cooling. We decided to take a Northern exit on the recommendation of a fellow hiker (Big Ups! Mark & Dan) and ended up on top of the Cave with panoramic views of the surrounding areas. A strenuous hike upward towards the peak proved to be a challenge, but I enjoyed it as I needed a good workout. With some rock-scrambling and bush-trekking we wound up at Castle Peak.

Definitely will be back to check out the other surrounding trails and do this one again!', 'Moderate activity on a Sunday morning. I took the loop counter clockwise, which had a great elevation gain at the beginning on the Crystal Springs trail. The Dean Trail is a bit more rolling. Got within 20 feet of a buck feeding by accident - the wildlife is very used to humans. Potential signs of bear or larger animals toward the back end. Really cool. Only reason it did not get 5 stars is the huge section of Dean along roads and parking lots. I WILL do this one again!', 'Clean trail! Lots of parking. yes there are restrooms. Park entrance is $6.  Cool and 95% shady! Lots of trees! The trails are properly marked! I will do it again. The trail is combination of flats and little elevations and downhill.', 'Great loop for moderate hike!', 'Nicely shaded trail and also really appreciated all the trail markers.', 'I would rate this a moderate trail. We did the Dean Trail first which is 2.2 mile upward trail. It has good shade.Would definitely go again', ""I really enjoyed this Trail. It's mostly shaded 85 to 90%. That's huge for people like me that are easily overheated. I take the dean's Trail first which is about 2.2 miles where you climb the elevation. I would consider it moderate if you're going to try and do it without stopping. once you get to the peak it's a very nice downhill 2.3 mile Trail that you can walk relaxing or run. Towards the very end it goes back to an incline to get to the parking lot that's where I usually just use it as my cool down period. the only thing about this trail that is a negative is that there's very little to no flowers or bloomage or anything other than the color green; and no water brook, etc. but it's one of my favorite trails to go to and it's only $6 to park."", 'Beautiful trail, lots of shade', 'Very dry. There was no wildlife and “crystal springs.” However it was a nice good work out. Finished in about 2.5 hours', 'A beautiful and relaxed hike that still gets your heart rate up. It took us just more than 2 hours to complete at a leisurely to semi-fast pace with a few stops to catch our breath and take in the views. Prepare for a lot of uphill for the first part of the hike, but the second part is almost only downhill and therefore quite pleasant. Would definetly walk this trail again if I lived nearby.', 'Nice hike with well maintained trails. Very casual loop hike.

Very peaceful and not very crowded place to come.', 'Really liked this park. We went on the chinquapin trail once which was a beautiful hike through the trees and very quiet. We also went another time and started at the Zwierlein Picnic area and went on part of the crystal spring trail', 'Pretty nice and lots of trails to choose from. However you have to pay $6 to park.', ""Great trails to see the redwoods and to stay in the shade.  I hiked Crystal Springs from Raymundo RD trailhead to Skyline and then back on Richard's Road.  Crystal Springs was fantastic, but as a note, going East to West, it is very much uphill.  That being said, Richard's road is the same way, but the eastern most mile is fairly flat and follows a great creek.  The total loop with Crystal and Richards was 8.2 miles.  My favorite part was the banana slugs.  They are pretty interesting!  As a note, Richard's road has quite a bit of gravel that can be a slip hazard if running west to east.  It also has an unfortunate power line running nearly directly over the trail for the last 1.5 miles (western end).  Not the end of the world, but kind of mitigates the ambiance.  Great trails!  Second the issue with having a paper map.  I found the Google Maps app on my phone had a great and accurate trail display of the area as a back up."", 'Well maintained trails that are better for running than hiking', 'Agree, they have a great trail system here.  Nice walks along the creek and up the old Russell road skid trail (dinosaur hill).  The upper part of the park is great, you can park on kings mountain and get to the dean trail or near the archery area with lots of nice trails around there.', ""This is a great trail system. Horse riding, hiking, trail running and even camping (easy car camping). You can do 15+ mile trips or short, 2-4 mile trips as well. Huge, beautiful trees with ravines and creeks throughout. Several of the main paths (Richards Road) are wide and even enough for side-by-side hiking and strollers. That said, there are several single track trails and if you go far enough back into the park you'll hit some serios elevation gains."", ""Beautiful trail but get a map at station.  The names of trails are different than what's on here. I plan on coming back to do more. "", ""Mothers Day, 2012, we visited Huddart Park to do some hiking.  Parked the car just inside the park entrance and started up the Crystal Springs Trail.  The trail meanders up the mountain through a gorgeous redwood trees forest.  At the top of the mountain, connected to the Summit Springs Trail and skirted the ridge line for approx. 3/4 mile before picking up Archery Fire Road and taking it straight down the mountain back to the car.  The Crystal Springs Trail is well marked and maintained.  Plenty of switchbacks and nearly all shaded.  Archery Fire Road was straight DOWN.  Hard on the knees and back, but we took it slow.  The descent was fairly steep, 1800' down to 1000' in 1.2 miles.  Not a hike I would recommend for small children.

All different kinds of undeveloped coast for your enjoyment and it really did feel “lost”.  Most days we saw only 4-6 people and no one else slept at the same campsites as us.

I would do it again in a heart beat!I strongly disagree with people who say the hike is the hardest hike they’ve ever been on - I would argue they likely have little to no experience backpacking in The West.  I wasn’t even sore when we finished the trail.  As someone who has summitted many 14ers including Whitney and also backpacked most of Yosemite, this was more mental challenge and less physical than the others I mentioned.  Only about 5 miles of this trail is a typical trail.  The rest is packed sand, fluffy sand, pebbles, boulders, or some kind of lava rock.  Trekking poles are a must if you are prone to rolling your ankle (or just want to move quickly without fear of losing balance on boulder fields).  You will need to think about where you are going before you take each step most of the way.  I think anyone in moderate or better shape can handle this trip but give yourself an extra day or two so you aren’t in a time crunch and tempted to take risks with the tide.  The trail is truly impassable in 2 stretches and there is no where to wait it out if you are between campsites - you will be swept out to sea and die.  So... be smart and err on the safe side.  Rule of thumb is be out of impassable zones 2 hrs before high tide and wait until 2 hours after as there are sneaker tides that shoot up occasionally as the tide goes out.  We would get up at 6am, hike until 2 hours before high tide and set up our tent at a campsite for a nap, cook a hot meal and pump water for that four hour window and then hike until dark once it was safe to continue.The first 4 miles and last 4 miles are the toughest because it is soft sand that your feet sinks into so it takes a lot of effort, esp with an extra 35 lbs of backpack.  I had no sleep the night before as I drove up from SF after midnight and was ready to turn around a mile or so into Mattole Beach but I am glad I did not.  The worst of it’s the very beginning or the very end.If you’re thinking about doing it, you should. Note permits can be a challenge so apply sooner than later!', 'I did this last week. It is the hardest hike I have ever been on.', ""This is a beautiful trail, and probably that's an understatement. \nFor starters, this was my first ever backpacking trip. So, first ever backpacking trip for a person who's 5feet (petite) and who hits the gym 10times a month on average. Whatever i read on this site and several other blogs definitely made me feel scared that I might not complete this and I'm doing something dumb. All i want to say is, this is not an impossible trail, being in shape and being fit helps, doing other backpacking trips before this might help too. But this can very much be your first backpacking trip as well. But again, if you're one of those who might get tired or might face severe body aches walking 5miles on flat/concrete land - then you might not want to consider doing this one. (I do want to add that I was on ibuprofen all three nights while hiking to reduce some body pains)\n\nWe started off at Mattole on Wednesday evening around 5PM and walked till about 8PM and camped around the lighthouse. We were not in the more crowded campground areas, we just managed to find a spot where it was just us and that did feel good.\nThursday - we started from the lighthouse and began walking around the first impassable spot, we took a lot of breaks, enjoyed the views, and hiked till Randall Creek and camped there. Again, we managed to find a not-at-all crowded spot which worked good.\nFriday - we started from Randall Creek and started walking the flat lands, again we took a lot of breaks, enjoyed the wind, the sun, the views and by the end of the day we came a bit farther than the major campground and again camped in a secluded spot (this one is just before the next impassable section)\nSaturday - we were determined to complete this trail and head back to black sands. we started a little early around 9AM (earlier days was around 11AM) and did not make major stops on the impassable section. We did one major stop at Buck Creek for breakfast and began hiking again. Honestly, the toughest part of the hike is the last 2miles. We successfully finished and reach black sands beach at about 5PM.\n\nOur original plan was Wednesday to Sunday, but we managed to get done by Saturday!\n\nCouple of things:\nTake your time, don't be in a rush just to finish the trail for the sake of finishing it. The view, the sun and the wind is pure and gorgeous. I'm very glad we took hour long breaks in so many spots and just enjoyed sitting out there in wilderness doing absolutely nothing. \n\nRocks maybe your new best friend. I understand a lot of reviews or blogs mentioned the last 5-6miles is beach sand and it is difficult. Heck yeah, it is difficult. For most of the part, i found my way around trying to walk on loose small rocks. For me, every time i saw that i could walk on the rocks, i was pretty glad. This may not work for everyone, keep in mind it is very very easy to sprain your ankle or get your ankle bent while walking on rocks (big or small, both of them exist in this trail)\n\nTidal timing is everything. I mean it, if you do not feel safe at any of the impassable sections to get through, just stay back. We did that. Honestly, we just memorized the general tidal timings from a high-level perspective. For us it was just being smart about the tides. If you have a general idea about tidal timings and did some good research before, you should be good. Again, carrying a tidal map is an absolute necessity. We did that, but we hardly opened it. \n\nPack light - if this your first backpacking trip, do pack light. We over analyzed our intake of food and toiletries and packed a little extra than needed. A bit more planning or idea might have helped us on that front. I would definitely suggest you to review your previous hikes you've done and see how your body consistently reacts to hiking. For example: I know if i'm on a long hike, by the end of it I lose most of my appetite and just require more water. But again, i forced myself to eat as much as possible to hike this one. \n\nStay hydrated, the first 3-5miles may not have any creeks, but there are abundant creeks through out the rest of the trail. So water should never be a problem, except bring a purifier for sure. \n\nSnakes: We did spot a couple of snakes, they were not rattle snakes. Not sure what they were, but we did spot one at Buck Creek while filling water and one around the land where we camped for the 3rd night. Be careful and check your entire surroundings before you camp somewhere. \n\nEnjoy the hike, it's beautiful and has some amazing view of the world's biggest ocean's coastline. Anything said to describe the trails beauty is not sufficient. It is something to just experience and soak it in.  \n\nIt is a long hike for sure, there were a couple of times in different days where i was tired and waiting to see if there's flat land anywhere at all. It can take a toll on you if you're not mentally up for it. For me, as much as a hike requires physical strength, it requires mental strength too."", 'A few important things that need to be stated: People using this trail are extremely problematic. Do I have your attention? I’m talking to you. There was trash in damn near every campsite we walked by. Half burned food packs in fire pits, cans, toilet paper and baby wipes every-damn-where, and on far too many occasions, piles of shit with a rock placed over them. If you do not know what backpacking etiquette is, educate yourself first, OR DO NOT GO. 1. PACK OUT YOUR TRASH. All of it. Do not burn it like an idiot. We all know plastic and foil packaging should not be burned. 2. BURRY your feces and toilet paper (if you don’t pack the TP out; do not burry wipes, they must be packed out) 6-8 inches deep.3. DO NOT HARASS THE WILDLIFE. This includes getting too close for photos as well as polluting their home with your trash. 4. LEAVE NO TRACE. This is one of the most beautiful hikes I have ever done, and to see the remnants of peak season use litter the pristine gem is beyond disappointing.', 'i was always in a hurry to see what was around the next corner.  next time got to slow down and appreciate it.  our August hike had perfect weather and tides.  it is a great hike, not nearly as difficult as anticipated.  plentiful water, no need to carry more than a liter at a time.', 'Left Mattole Sunday morning and made it to Black Sands on Tuesday a little before noon. One of the best backpacking trips I’ve been on. We had one clear day and then a couple foggy days. Make sure you check the tides and truly obey the schedule. There were a few times that we were a couple hours on either side of high tide and we had some waves come up to our waist, this was ok but I can see how some might have gotten washed away if it was any later or earlier. It was definitely not easy and if this is your first backpacking trip I’d recommend doing another trip first before trying this one out. However it is doable if you are in good shape. Lots of walking on sand and loose rocks. Everyone we met on the trail was very nice and our group now has many memories to take home with us. I definitely recommend this trip and would do it again (but for now it’s ice and Advil for the legs).', 'Incredible! A genuine California experience. Some tips that I learned: hike the trail close to a new moon (the lowest tides will be during the day) and pay attention to vague signs leading you over hat rock. It was a wonderful trip though.', 'Amazing backpacking trail. beautiful views and campsites along creeks; we got a swim in each night. The low number of permits keep this lightly trafficked and we ran into few people. You do need to plan around the tides and walking on sand and rocks for most of the trail is hard on your feet, so bring tape for blisters. We did the trail in July and had great weather.', 'Amazing trail. This was my first coastal hiking, and as the other reviewers said here, it is important to download a tide chart and understand how to read it as there are two 4-mile stretches of impassible zones. I found low tide easier to hike because the sand was more packed, and I could avoid more of the cobblestone type rocks. The northern impassible zone would likely be truly impassible in my experience (I travelled at full moon and very light surf and winds) - I hit that part at receding tide and even then some areas were iffy. The impassible zone south of Miller flat may be doable in high tide with calm conditions, but I wouldn’t risk it. The views, solitude and wildlife make this trail one of my all time favorites. I bought a map, rented a bear canister and got a free tide chart from the lost coast adventures shuttle. Please note that there is no cell service in Settlers Cove and anywhere along the coast - so plan in advance.', 'Cons:\n- 5+ hour drive to Bay Area \n- $80 shuttle ride not including tip \n- Walking long stretches on wet, unstable rocks\n- Lots of poison ivy \n- Had to climb portions of rock that are very dangerous where tide came in too high \n- Walking at an angle in sand that is not packed down at all, caused foot injury for me \n- Lot of people backpacking the trail \n- Tides coming in and out very stressful, reaching and finishing impassable zones challenging \n- Zero marking on trail\n- Bear footprints on beach \n- Very difficult to be rescued in this area and is dangerous enough to be a concern\n- no cell service \nPros:\n- Beautiful scenery \n- Some private campsites \n\nMy boyfriend and I are avid backpackers and completed this trail in 2 nights/3 days in mid July. \nI did not enjoy it and found myself looking down for a lot of the trail trying to stay balanced on the rocks. I personally do not find walking on rocks to be enjoyable when backpacking. My boyfriend liked the trail because of the challenge. For me, it was too difficult to enjoy. I thought this trail would be mostly walking on sand and did not factor in the rock aspect or stress with the impassable tide zones. There were a lot of people hiking the trail and I was hoping to be a little more isolated than that. There was one very sketchy portion of the trail we encountered on the first day where the water on the beach was too high so we had to climb up and over a portion of rocks that was very dangerous with some other people who took the same shuttle as us. (note: this was not at high tide) The one upside was that the scenery was beautiful. However, I advise really knowing what you are getting into, this is not an easy or moderate trail by any means.', 'A beautiful trip! If you’re decently in shape and have good balance, you can do this trip in 2 full days, but it’s nice to have some extra time to soak in the beauty. Definitely wear waterproof hiking boots so you don’t roll your ankle (you probably will anyways. There is barely any elevation gain, but you will be walking on the slanted beach, which feels odd after many miles of repetitive strain. Bring layers! You need a permit and a bear canister. We saw bear prints in the sand. There aren’t many trees hang your food from.The impassible zones are indeed impassible at high tide! Make sure you check the tide chart, or get ready to be very wet. We went about an hour after a moderately high high tide and were chased by many waves. It was very fun, but know what you’re getting into.', 'A lot less strenuous than I thought. Nice three day trip!', 'A rare gem where it is possible to backpack along the Pacific Coast without any sign of civilization. To reiterate what others have said you want to understand the tide and protect your food from bears. Its a lot of loose rocks more than packed sand, so the miles here will take a lot more out of you than they would in other places. Sneakers might actually be a better choice than hiking boots for this trail.', ""We 3 did the north section from June 1st to June 3rd.\nThe weather was amazine, the forecast said it has somewhere 15 mph gust and regular 10 wind, but I don't really feel it. Temperature around 70-80 during the day and around 50 at night.\n\nWe camped at Shelter Cove RV and Campground on 31st, it is a much more expensive campground($46 for 3 people), but it has shower, and flush toilet, and most importantly, it is very close and reservable to the Black Sand Beach Trailhead, where we take our shuttle.\n\nWe took Lost Coast Adventure shuttle to Mattole Beach Trailhead. The service was nice and price reasonable. The only improvement which I would say is maybe ability to adjust the shuttle according to tide time, will be better.\n\nSpeaking of the tide, I originally was not quite sure about how high a tide is safe for hiking. I was planning for 2.5ft as the safe zone for us to hike, which only allow us to hike early morning to noon. But during our hike we assessed the actual situation, we actually hiked in 3-4 ft(forecast tide level, not actual) period and we did it. There was only one or two points which I felt a bit sketchy between Miller Flat to Shipman Creek during 3-4 ft tide zone. But we managed to get through, giving the beautiful weather and mercy of little-wind.\n\nMy original plan was first day 4.5 miles to Seal Lion Gulch, second day 12 miles to Miller Flat, third day end the hike with 8.5 miles. But after words I felt we totally didn't follow the plan.\n\nWe 3 are all relatively fast hikers, we started at 9:30am, reached Sea Lion Gulch around 11:45ish, one of our guy's boots had failed him having the front half of the out soles falling from the boots. He managed to fixed it with duct tape and we kept going. We arrived at Cooskie Creek about some time past 1pm.\n\nWe took lunch, nap on the beach, it was beautiful. And we started again at 5:45pm, this time we reached Spanish Flat. The hike of the later afternoon was much harder than the morning, the terrain was mostly soccer sized pebbles and the tide was higher than the morning. We need to be really careful about the footing and watch the tide. We arrived at Spanish Flat about 7:30. Started a fire, had dinner, and I played with my camera, finally after so many backpacking trip carrying it without utilizing it, shot the starry sky.\n\nSecond day we started late around a quarter to 10 am, same pattern, this time we took our break at Miller flat around 2. There was nice swimming holes at both Big Creek and Miller Flat, we took a dip at Miller Flat.\n\nWe picked up from Miller flat at about 5:15pm. Here after Miller Flat we came across the sketchy point about less than a mile towards Shipman Creek. Once we arrived at Shipman Creek, the poor guy's outsoles was found completely peeled off the bottom of the boots. Again, this genius hiker fixed it again with ropes, multitool, and small pebbles! Such creativity!!! We finally camped at Gitchell Creek at 7:30pm, enjoyed incredible sunset, warm campfire and amazing starry night sky again.\n\nLast day was easy, only 3.6 miles, but all on sandy beach, walking was not as easy as on solid ground. We finished the hike at 12pm."", 'This was a life changing backpacking trail. Couple of recommendations: (1) Download the tide chart and plan around the impassable areas https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/noaatidepredictions.html?id=9418024 (2) Treat your clothing for ticks with permethrin - ticks are particularly bad in Humboldt county according to local hospitals. Enjoy your time - the wildflowers are beautiful, look for starfish and other wildlife!', ""Description\nThis is a magical trail that has absolutely the most beautiful views of the coastline while providing an isolated completely plugged out experience.  You don't have to go all the way one way.  Couple of options:  1. Go all the way and arrange for a ride to drop off at parking location\n2. Start at the north point and do as far as you want.  Camp and do day hikes through the trail to get a good look at the middle section\n3. Start on the south end and do the same as # 2\nEither way you will get plenty of site seeing and some wildlife if you're lucky.  We got to see a herd of Elk passing by.  They were playing at the beach - I have never seen animals having fun at the beach like these elks.\n\nThere are many wet parts of the trail, you are inevitably going to get we, so bring waterproof shoes and clothes that will dry easy.  If you catch warm weather, the beach was a lot of fun to hang around and explore."", 'This was my first backpacking trip and it was absolutely amazing! Just incredibly beautiful. If you love the beach, you get it. Did it comfortably in three days (Start 5/19 @ 10am - End 5/21 @ 3pm). 2 days is tough but doable. Bring tide charts because there are impassable sections. Would recommend buying the BLM map.  Campsites are easily found and common at wide mouthed rivers even in the impassable sections! Plenty of water sources. There’s relative solitude during Spring/Summer. Permit is required! Would recommend going North to South, taking a shuttle Mattole and leaving your car at the Black Sands. Terrain is pretty roughy, either big rocks or sand so be prepared! Absolutely amazing trip!', 'About 7 of us and my dog did this entire trip just last weekend. March 16-19, 2018. It was incredible. We expected rain but ended up with perfect blue skies and warm weather. Creeks were high but still passable. Always expect to get wet on this trip. If you pack and dress appropriately then its not even an issue. The campsites are defined by the fire pits alone the bluffs. I would seriously not recommend camping on the beach. The sand is manageable but the sand fleas are a nightmare. They are active all night. It almost sounds like it’s raining out the tent. The wildlife was amazing. We saw seals and elephant seals, sea otters, tons of cool shorebirds, and even blow holes from the whales passing in the distance. Shuttle from the south end to the north end. The road is rough and it’s better to leave the driving to the experts. And take notes from other blogs. This trail is hard. 10 miles on flat ground is easy but the loose rock and sand turns 2 full steps into about 1 1/2 steps. Even the fastest hiker is slowed down. I would not recommend for any dog’s first backpacking trip. By the last day my dog was sore and tired. He’s only two. Booties are required for all dogs. I took my dogs booties off at campsites or short stretches of soft sand. His feet were still tender afterwards but far better than being cut up and beaten.', 'Easily one of the most epic backpacking trips in NorCal. A rugged, oceanside trail, like no other.

You can easily slip at any point in this trail and get severely injured.\n\nDay 2 from cooksie creek to big flats creek was the best.\n\nI recommend against taking your dog it is extremely dangerous for them. You will have to carry them at certain points where you need to cross jagged shale steps.

Do not take your dog unless it has previous experience with extremely difficult terrain.', ""beautiful trail!  views are amazing and it's a very unique trail!  lots of sand and pebble trail walking."", ""Great backpacking route. My girlfriend and myself did it early Sept 2017. A couple things to consider before going: 1) the road to get to mattole from Redway is terrible- have a vehicle with decent ground clearance. 2) If you are someone who doesn't enjoy a good physical challenge, this might not be your trail. The hiking at an angle along the sand takes a tole on your hips, and ankles. 3) the first section of impassible at high tide there aren't really any areas to escape if you mistimed the tide, the second section there are a couple areas where you can escape. 4) Very little protection from the sun/wind, so be prepared with sunscreen and wind protective gear if it's windy. 5) If you shuttle, consider leaving your car at the bottom, and shuttling to Mattole. I wish we would have done this! Overall a gorgeous hike. Recommend it to any outdoor enthusiast!"", ""Best 3 days of my life! Don't forget your tide guide, keep hydrated.  Many terrains, creek crossings, hillsides, fields and whole lot of beach."", ""Went at the end of July. I am ready to go again!  We pushed through in 3 days, but I'd love to do a lot of side hikes and take 5 days to enjoy it even more.

My Dad and I hiked this in 3 days/2 nights. We hiked 12 miles on day 1, 8 miles on day 2, and 4 miles on day 3. I really recommend doing as many miles as you can on the first day to have an easy hike out the last day because it is all sand over the last stretch. The best part of the trip was getting the chance to see a bear! We started day 3 around 7AM and about an hour in, we hear movement through the bushes on the ridge to our left and turns out it was a bear cub! Bears are really out there so be cautious of your food and scented items. If you are thinking about this hike, go do it! You will not regret hiking the Lost Coast.', 'Amazing hike! Definitely need a tide chart for this one, but if you take the shuttle, you can ask them ahead of time for one. Our driver adjusted the tide chart the morning of the hike. Each day was adjusted and it definitely came in handy. We had a slow Day 1 on the trail and got stuck at the overland pass at the start of the first impassable zone. Instead of hiking back and setting up camp for the night, we waited until the tide was receding to start a sunset/night hike through the tide zone and another 2 to the Spanish Flats. It was mildly dangerous, but we had headlamps and were able to hike under the Milky Way. Definitely my favorite part of the trip.', 'Only took the trail to the lighthouse. Hard to know exactly where trail is...lots of walking on sand which is a bit disorienting and takes energy and time. The lighthouse is viewable from the spot marked on the map, but it was at least another mile before we reached it. I would recommend trying it out, but be prepared for a lot of walking on sand (wear proper shoes) and a longer walk to the lighthouse than was shown on the app.', ""I've hiked this trail several times it has been different each time due to tides winds and rains.

Awesome stuff..I keep writing an actual review, but it's not saving here. sorry folks!"", 'The Lost Coast is interesting. It has a mix of terrain unlike any other place I have backpacked. You go from brown fine sand to small gravel to larger gravel back to fine sand and then walking through a field to then go boulder hopping and then finish with fine black sand. The great part about it is that when you are getting sick of walking on one type of terrain, it will change in another mile. If you bring your dog please, please, please bring booties. \nYou do need to watch out for rattlesnakes, scorpions and poison oak when settling down for the night. We encountered each of these.\nWe started off camping in Mattole Friday night and set off early Saturday morning and hiked 12 miles the first day, about 10 the second day and 3 the last day. If you camp at Mattole bring a jug of water to start out your morning, the spigots there do not work but the first stream is about 2 miles away so you can make it.\nI do recommend getting an official map of the area, it totally helps you navigate if you do not take a shuttle and decide to leave one car at Mattole and the other at Black Sands.', ""This hike is amazing!

Doesn't feel fantastic walking in the sand for many miles, but eventually you get use to it and the hike is totally worth it. Would suggest to everyone."", ""Gorgeous hike! Definitely will not leave you wanting for epic and diverse views. A few things to note/tips:-plan ahead and book a shuttle from black sands parking lot to get you to the mattole trailhead. park at black sands. $80/pp for the shuttle and it takes 2 hours to get you to the trailhead. -there are basically no trail markers for the Lost coast trail. So bring a map and watch for other hiker's and well worn trails. -terrain: 50% sand, 30% actual dirt trails, 20% boulders/rocks. the few dirt trails are such a relief in between sandy beaches. These trails often aren't marked unfortunately, so they are easy to miss. -bring a tide chart as there are two 4 miles stretches that are unpassable at high tide. -there is ample water right now.(July 2017) multiple creeks /rivers besides what's shown on the map. expect a water source every 2 miles so you shouldn't have to carry too much. I carried a 30pound pack, and am a semi experienced backpacker (have been on 5 trips to date) and found it a moderate hike. Lack of serious elevation changes made it seem easier. The giant rock/Boulder fields were most difficult just because it required full attention to every step (no one wants a rolled ankle!)."", 'Great hike with amazing views and wildlife... Loved the experience of being ""trapped"" along a creek by the tide with nobody else there except the folks you hiked in with! Went in late June spending 3 nights, would have spent 4 with a short early out the next morning but couldn\'t find any good camping for larger groups (there were 8 of us) in the last 5 miles so we settled for pizza and beer in Shelter Cove.What everyone says about the terrain is true, some parts are quite challenging but just stick to a comfortable pace and plan around the tides accordingly and you\'ll be fine. Our group ranged from 25 to 70 in varying physical conditions and we all emerged essentially unscathed.Highly recommended!!', ""Words can't describe this stretch of California.

There is very little hard surface, easy walking, hiking here- most of it is sand, some of it is boulders from bowling ball size to house size, all the boulder fields are difficult walking with hazardous potential if you fall or step incorrectly. It is real work to walk in sand with 50 pounds on your back. Lovely hike but don't say no one told you and forewarned you...."", ""The word epic is overused often in the backpacking realm, but this trail is absolutely epic. We did it at the end of May, perfect weather. Parked the rental on the south end, took the shuttle north. While there arent any sudden rugged elevation changes, the varying terrain makes it more challenging than one might initially think. Wet sand, dry sand, small pebble beaches, boulder fields, you name it. There is no shortage of fresh water, making it a much lighter trek than usual. I carried less than 1 liter at all times, and just filtered on the go at each fresh water crossing.The prevailing wind makes it seem cooler then it really is, and makes the sun seem less intense, so don't underestimate sunscreen.If you're thinking about going, stop thinking and just go. The sunsets will blow your mind."", ""Amazing hike.  Beautiful sunsets. I got lulled in by the hard trail intermixed with the sand.  The last 5-6 miles are all sand so plan accordingly.

Get used to walking through sand and rocks though', 'This hike was absolutely gorgeous. I arrived at Shelter Cove around noon and made sure everything was nice and tight on my pack. I met with the shuttle and we left at about 12:30. After a gorgeous 2 hour drive filled with stories about the area, I arrived at the trailhead at 2:30. I immediately set off and made it to the lighthouse pretty quickly. After departing from there, I met two rangers. The first thing out of their mouth was ""Can I see your permit?"", so I can\'t stress enough, make sure you have one. I lost track of time for awhile, seeing nobody at all, and just took in the beauty of the place. I set up my tent near Randall Creek and enjoyed some hot food while watching the sun go down. The next morning, I was up and back on the trail right around day break. This time, I took a much slower pace, and even needed to stop for awhile to wait for the tide to go down. My second night was spent at Buck Creek, where I met a wily world traveler who I\'ll refer to as ""Alaska Mike"". We sat around the fire and swapped stories late into the night. The next day, the entire hike was sand and rocks, but with fantastic views all the way back to the parking lot at Shelter Cove. I think next time I\'ll go much slower, as I finished in less than 48 hours. All in all, I\'d definitely recommend this hike. It\'s a beautiful bit of coastline that offers a few days away from cell phone service, smog, and the noise of city life.', ""Incredibly dreamy backpacking trip. Probably one of my all time favorite locations in California. I went during labor day weekend, and there were a lot of people who had the same idea. Sunrises and sunsets are not to be missed here.

As other users have mentioned impassable areas during high tide means that you'll prob do some minor rock climbing to get through the area if you're like me and didn't really plan around tide. :P"", 'Absolutely loved it!', 'I would take 4 days as well. the tidal areas can get a little tense. and the ground varies between sand and soccer ball sized rocks. so I would recommend good shoes.They say no camp fires but it seemed everyone had them. doggie shoes and pack are a must.', 'I recommend that you take at least 4 days to enjoy this hike.  There is so much to see, between the tide pools and the surrounding mountains.  But the footing can be uneven, so it is easy to walk by without even looking up.', 'If you can stand slogging through miles of sand it is a beautiful trail! Lots of fresh water and campsites.', ""Totally awesome hike. Beautiful secluded beaches. Do it in two days, not three if you're a decent hiker."", 'Overwhelmingly beautiful. Long may it last.', 'Great backpacking trail! Hard 2 day, easy 3 day. Lots of fresh water outlets for refilling water bottles. Could not say enough great things about this trail!', 'amazing views, a tough but rewarding hike. I do it every year.', 'Amazing hike! Definitely plan for at least 3 nights and 4 days. It gets very cold and windy at night, and you will FOR SURE get wet while crossing some creeks or walking along the coast. Make sure you get a map and a tide chart from the station before you start hiking. Plan your hikes and distance around the tides. It took us twice as long to travel on sand, so take that into consideration. We hiked north to south, and the last section has 4 miles of impassible terrain during high tide. Make sure to do this section during a receding/low tide, as well as the last 3 miles before Black Sand Beach. If you need a place to stop and camp there are hidden campgrounds up on the hills about 3/4 of a mile after the 4miles of impassible tide crossing. The impasible tide is real, I got hit and dragged a bit w my dog even though we did it during receding ride. Keep your pup on leash when traveling along the coast or crossing the creeks. Our dogs tried to run after a a couple of beavers making their way to the ocean. The doggy backpack with the handle on top was helpful to lift them and help them cross strong currents. Doggie boots are a MUST. Use them during rocky sections along the coast- give their paws a rest when is just sand or regular trail. Keep all your food and toiletries in a bear canister, there are bears and small rodents that will steal your food and any good smelling belongings. Bring a pair of water moccasins to help you cross through the creeks and keep your walking shoes dry. Also, extra pairs of socks and mold skin to help with blisters. Overall, amazing hike and just enough adrenaline for a fun adventure!', 'Was amazing, know your tides and be smart with your map and miles due to the lack of signs. It just adds to the adventure! Btw a lot of wildlife, black bear and elephant seals now! Sick place!', ""At first we did not like this trail! If there were trail heads, they are hard to find. We ended up hiking all the way to rattlesnake ridge the first day, and had to double back to camp on the beach huts, they were super cool! We ended up taking two days to hike back to our car, that originally took one day. But we ended up meeting a park ranger on the way back, she was super nice. Just FYI get the map from the ranger station, that's why we had such a difficult time finding trails. If you are ok with lots of sand, and a major leg work out, then this trail would be good. We saw lots of wild life, it's not very cold at night, in fact I often unzipped my sleeping bag. We did pass the impassable shore line, just be very careful. Overall, it was very fun and pretty, definitely will go back!"", ""Incredible place, the wind, sea spray, fog,, old lighthouse, breaking waves, ozone, magical place if you look at it right, you'll be shown the light"", ""The best 25 miles I've ever hiked."", ""Just completed a figure 8 of both the northern section in the King's Range (more frequently hiked) and the southern section in the Sinkyone Wilderness. We chose to hike the Southern section first so that the tides worked in our favor on the northern section. Someone had mentioned that the southern section was rugged but we weren't prepared for just how unmaintained the trail actually was. Tons of sharp steep small switchbacks from Usal to Needle Rock with lots of elevation climb and descent (you have to hike over ridges to then descend to the ocean for camping). We spend 2.5 days on the southern section in almost complete solitude... There was no one else on the trail with us until we hit Wheeler... And then people were hiking in through Needle Rock so they didn't have to set up a shuttle. It was amazing and quite possibly one of the hardest hikes I've done but definitely most rewarding. We then set up a shuttle for the northern section to hike Mattole to Black Sands Beach and went in on a Sunday which ended up being great timing because we felt we were somewhere in the middle of others hikes. The first 12 miles of the northern section is amazing and I would hike it again in a heart beat. Mattole to Cooksie was fantastic but I would just hate to hike against that northern wind! The last 10 miles of the northern section is mostly rock and sand and can be very challenging. We met plenty of people that said they would never do the trail again because of it. Again we spent our nights at the campsites either alone or with only 1 or 2 other small groups of people. It was definitely amazing. The drive out of Mattole to Eureka was a sight in and of itself! The roads are not maintained well but the views were spectacular!! I will come back for sure."", 'Amazing', ""Hiked this trail in November of 2014. Still to this day, out of my hundreds of miles of backpacking, view this as one of the most incredible trails. Words can not describe the energy of the place and how easily it is overlooked. Don't make this mistake and do this trail if you have a chance. I parked at the Southside and hitchiked to the north end, which took me 1.5 days. After Mattole, I headed south over 3 days and took time to enjoy it all. the people I met were amazing and the experiences were the best. This is a non-negotiable if you love backpacking."", 'Beyond word. This trail is everything anyone could ask for. We backpacked 5 days going from north to south (Mattole Beach to Usal Beach). The north section is all along the beach. Flat but sandy and rocky (and windy!) Trekking poles were a huge help. The south section was in and out of the mountains along side the ocean. Some pretty steep climbs and intense declines but every turn brings you face to face with something spectacular! Wild flowers, lush green trails, golden sunsets, nearly-tropical flora along side towering redwoods. Truly phenomenal. I will be returning to the Lost Coast again next year!', 'Such a beautiful trail. Had a great time backpacking this trail. Hiked the trail in 2.5 days. Recommend hiking north to south. Because of wind will be at your back. Start at Mattole and end at Black Sand Beach. Quick not trail is mostly beach walking and sand can be deep.', ""Amazing trail with lots of beautiful ocean views. Be mindful of high tides. Parts are impassible during high tides. Low tides gives you the ability to see beautiful tide pools and speeds up your hiking time due to walking on compacted sand. Don't forget to stop and take in the sights"", ""Beautiful hike. Camping can be a bit limited so it's best to try and get a camp site early."", ""A favorite! We did 31 miles on the lost coast and i cant wait to do it again! I went with a dog, and believe me, you absolutely need dog booties for your pooch! Hiking on the beach isn't easy, but be super mindful of high and low tides. Our group got 'stranded' on a ridge during an unexpected high-tide. Luckily, we saw approx. 30-35 grey whales while we waited!! Bring water pumps/filter, and rain-gear :) Beautiful California poppies surrounded parts of the trail! Saw tons of wildlife. Enjoy!"", ""Great Hike!  I went there with a couple friends and we entered the State Park from the south.  We camped on the beach and did a short day hike. 6 Miles round trip.  We turned around at Dark Gulch.  We definitely didn't even scratch the surface of the place so we can't wait to go back.  There were a lot more people there than we expected unfortunately and finding a camping spot on a Friday was a little difficult.  Which is why we camped on the beach and not under the trees a few hundred yards away.\n\nNote:  When we were there the fog was very thick and the sea breeze kept things cool/chilly for the less insulated.  The trail will take you above the fog layer so bring sunscreen as well."", ""This was my first backpacking trip and it was wonderful. We did a 20 mile loop instead of the whole 24.8 mile trail. You have to time your hike with the tides because there are parts of the trail that aren't passable during high tide. There are pockets of fresh water flowing into the sea so a water supply isn't an issue. Even though I didn't have any with me, it helps to hike with trekking poles to cross the small streams and gain better balance on the rocky parts of the trails."", 'love this trail cant wait to do it again.', 'loved this trail. It was Beautiful hike along the beaches of the northern California. there where alot of streams for fresh water. we did the trip in 4 day thou could be done in two', ""I've done the bear harbor to wheeler camp twice now. It's moderately strenuous with some steep inclines and declines that seem to last forever but it is completely worth it. Beautiful coastal views as long as redwoods. There's a lot of wildlife in terms of birds, reptiles and Roosevelt elk. I highly recommend this hike if you want some seclusion and your own black sand beach"", ""can't wait to go back."", 'nice view. wild life.', 'Lots of Beach hiking on rocks and deep sand, but great scenery of the ocean, wildflowers and wildlife.  ', ""Stunning views.  Great camping (esp. beside Randall Creek, our Camp2).  Nothing too strenuous on the parts we did (Mattole -- Spanish Flat and back over 3 days).  Be sure to bring a tide chart, and don't drop it.  We found someone's along a trail.  Not good.  Bear can is a must.  It's a trek to get there (in the car), but you won't regret it.  Also, this yields the happy result of few people on the trail.  Trekking poles would've been nice on the rocks on the beach.  We'll definitely return to complete more of the trail."", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '',

I look forward to getting back to it in the summer when the snow is gone. It’s incredibly beautiful, and as others have said, incredibly challenging. I would say with the snow, this is more difficult than “moderate”. It’s easy to follow the trails from those who’ve already been up.', ""Completed on 12/23/18. The hike was very challenging, especially on snowshoes. Like other reviewes stated, it's more like 8 miles round trip. Stunning views and great solidarity at this time of year. Somewhat dangerous as well however, as it was extremely steep at parts and icy, especially at the peak. Highly suggested for advanced hikers!"", 'Phenomenally beautiful views from the peak, but significantly longer and more difficult than listed!', 'Worth the view! but definitely tough. This was 8.2 miles total and pretty steep for most of it. Going back down is easy but I would say this is more hard then Moderate.', 'Great hike with a solid amount of elevation gain. The hike is 8 miles round trip with 2800 feet of elevation gain. You start winding your way through beautiful forest and emerge to views of Sierra at Tahoe (a local ski resort). After crawling up a steep section the trees begin to thin and eventually you emerge to unbelievable views. You can see more lakes and mountains than you will know what to do with. Have fun and be safe. This is a nice trail all the way to the top, not too rocky and lots of good footing.', 'Great trail, however this is 4.1 miles each way (value from iWatch plus two trail guides) not the 6.5 stated here!', 'Beautiful hike this time of the year. The weather was great and helped with the steady climb to the top. Enjoyed it a lot ! Short and moderate hike.', 'Moderate My Ass!', 'Great work out in a short distance.', 'One of my faves. Short and sassy!', 'Great view at the top...well worth it! The thing that was hard tho there were no creeks for water. It’s more a fall winter spring hike.Still a great hike tho!!!', 'My first peak hike. Stunning views at the top.', ""This hike is fab!!! I went in late June with my cousins, during a very hot time of day. So hear this: Bring at least 3-4 bottles of water and make sure everyone in your party does, too!!!! Just every time you hike, make sure everyone has plenty of water. Although I was prepared, all my cousins only had 1 or 2 bottles, and 1 of them brought nothing. So I shared a lot, and so did my uncle, who just brought a cooler backpack filled with water and tea.  There are no water sources or bathrooms at all. \n\nAnyway, as long as your totally hydrated, this is a great hike! The further up the mountain we got, the louder my exclamations were at the lovely view.  It's steep for almost all of it, and there are rock scrambles along the way.  As you approach the summit, it's all rock- small rocks. So be careful with your footing. \n\nReaching the peak is simply incredible.  All the negativity from being thirsty, hot, and tired evaporated. an immense view of Lake Tahoe, Desolation Wilderness, and so many other lakes and snow surrounded us.  Although we saw snow, none was on the trail.  At the top of the mountain, there's a small box with a few little notebooks and pencils where past hikers signed in and wrote nice comments.  If you go, be sure to bring a small notebook, because when we went, all the notebooks were full. So maybe you'd like to add another and be the first entry.\n\nIt was an amazing hike. I totally recommend it!"", 'Great day hike. The elevation gain is fairly mild for most of the trail. The view from the summit is spectacular. If you want to plan your next backpacking destination in the Desolation Valley, then Ralston Peak provides the best vantage point with less effort than the surrounding peaks.', 'Fun Trail, Awesome Views!', 'Had a wonderful hike to Ralston Peak.

My thoughts and prayers go out to all those who are putting their lives on the line.', 'Good solid grind going up. Still hazy but the view is still amazing. Bring water!  I brought 3 liters and drank 1.5. Always have more then you think you’ll drink. Having less is horrible ', 'Climbed to the rocky peak without any difficulty. So Smokey at top due to Yosemite fire could barely see the lakes below. Ran into very large rattle snake on trail. 11 rattles. Climbed Whitney 2 days later.', ""Ralston is without a doubt one of my favorite trails around Tahoe, at least for summit views. The trek up is pretty straight forward starting as a dirt hike across moderate switchbacks before kicking up to a more aggressive mix of loose rock and more dirt as you leave the treeline. Given the consistent exposure and fairly steep upper section, be sure to bring plenty of water (see many people hiking this as if it's a couple city-miles rather than mountain ones.) For the effort, the view up top is all the reviews say and then some with so many lakes, peaks and forest lands to take in at once.\n\nConditions as of this post: All dirt, no major obstacles, fairly easy to follow the trail though do pay attention on the upper sections as the path can fade out over the boulders. Bring extra water, good shoes for the steeper climb, layers for the exposed summit."", 'An excellent trail with great rewards. We took off at 7:30am which was perfect. You start by working your way through the trees and meadows which isn’t too hard. The next stretch is the hardest as you wind through a part of the trail with lots of rocks and loose dirt. The final climb is  steep but the ground is solid so it’s easy to keep your footing. The last 1/10 of a mile you need to maneuver over lots of rocks but just take your time. Great views of Echo Lakes, Lake of the Woods, Aloha, Lake, Fallen Leaf and Tahoe. Took us about three hours with a few breaks to enjoy the views.', 'If you’re looking for a difficult hike with lots of climbing, this trail is it. This trail was all uphill right from the beginning and gets even more steep when you get to the top, but it was definitely worth it for the need view of the beautiful blue lakes. There were a lot of bugs everywhere, and even more bugs up at the top, so make sure you bring bug spray!', ""I thought this trail was difficult due to steepness, but so worth the views at the peak! First 1.5 miles isn't bad but when you get to the fork and turn right, you're looking at a steep climb. Bring poles! They saved us. At the peak, we saw at least 9 lakes. Gorgeous. Great mix of sun and shade throughout the trail. Bring more water than you think you'll need!"", 'Good work out with payoff of excellent views at the top!\nIt has a fair amount of sun exposure so bring lots of water and sun screen.', 'Thigh burner strenous steep hiking.

Beautiful view at the peak as always! Ralston Lake still covered with snow.', 'Great hike.  Snow for about 1/4 of the trip near the summit.  Great views!', 'Did this hike today. Still lots of snow near the top which makes it a bigger challenge. It was warm for the first half but once you hit the snow we also were smacked with pretty windy conditions.

Steady climb for sure   Still a lot of snow   Top was very cold but worth the view   Good day on Mount Ralston', 'Packed my snowshoes just because and was glad I did. Still enough snow covering the trail to make it more challenging. Cold and windy at the top with no place to hide. Coming down was fun, the snow was melting a bit and it mage for some slippery going. Love this hike, worth the effort.', 'Great run today, no crampons, top third solid snow stayed hard till about 10.. harder run than no snow for sure,', 'The difficulty/reward ratio on this trail is in favor of hikers who want to complete one of their first summits and boast, ""so yeah, this weekend I climbed a mountain... No biggie."" At 6.5 miles total, it is brief and perfect for a day hike. Make no mistake, however, it isn\'t a walk in the park the whole way up. Your legs will get a work out. \n\nShortly after the trailhead, which is located at a parking lot along I-50 that is often not plowed between Dec-Mar, a series of switchbacks zigzagging their way through a densely forested area begin. This goes on quite a bit, and takes up a significant portion of the hike. Those who want spectacular views - fear not! - as the views begin once you get in the clearer area at a higher elevation where less vegetation grows. It will start to get steep and you may be wishing for those gentle switchbacks you were on recently.\n\nSpeaking of vegetation, near the summit you will pass contorted and twisted trees known as ""Krumholtz"", German for ""crooked wood"". Looking like something out of a Guillermo del Doro film, these deformed trees live a tough life due to incessant wind and snow. Soak in the views of Lake Tahoe, various other alpine lakes including Aloha Lake, Mt Tallac in the distance, from the summit.\n\nBonus: at your own risk, on the right side of the summit, there is a Class 3 scramble on extremely loose rocks and climb that can get you to one of the lakes.', ""I just did this hike today. Unfortunately, I was unable to make it to the top because of all the snow. I kept slipping and sliding and decided I'd have to come back and try again once it melts a little more! But the climb up was an awesome workout, and it's a beautiful trail :)"", 'Cool hike especially if you are getting ready for longer trips. I went to the top on 4/13/18 and the last rain had washed away the previous footprints towards the top so having a gps made it a lot easier to follow. While following my footsteps out I found some bear prints next to mine that weren’t there during the hike up.', 'I would recommend the Mount Tallac hike to this one. Also the distances are a bit skewed. At the trail head it lists it as one way 4.1 miles. I tracked about 3.8 miles one way - so much shorter than what is listed (Alltrails lists it at 3.2 miles one way which is a bit short than what it really is). The elevation gained also is about 2800 ft - a bit lower than what is listed in alltrails. The views from the top are excellent though.', 'great views', 'My soul is filled with the holy spirit of Mother Earth. Such beauty!', 'This was a great hike, you have to work hard to get to the top. Early snow for us but nothing unmanageable, glad we brought wind jackets for a quick lunch at the top. Must have been couples day, each group we passed was a couple.  Coming down the trail is an equally good workout, my feet felt the downhill.', 'Such a good workout with the reward of amazing views at the top!', 'This is a very steep, strenuous climb, but the distance is relatively short, and it was much more pleasant than I remember. The trail was still moist and verdant, the wild flowers were blooming once the elevation is gained, and the view from the peak is spectacular. We ran into very few hikers all along, and we were solo at the top of the peak, enjoyed our late lunch, awed in nature. The view was a bit hazy though perhaps due to Yosemite wild fire. We’ve done the part of this trail several years ago when we hiked to Lake Aloha via this trail, out and back (didn’t make right to the peak, kept going straight to the lakes direction). It was around the same time of a year (early September), but it was in the year of draught, so everything was drier, Lake Aloha was mere puddle, and the whole hike was much longer, so finishing up the long hike with this steep trail left me an impression that this trail was strenuous, relentless, hot and dry. It makes a huge difference if the trail is green with flowers, and offers a panoramic view as a reward.It’s a great, relatively short, very hard hike with a spectacular view as a reward.', 'Totally worth the view recommend having some pretty good cardio and fresh pair of legs as it is a pretty strenuous hike to the top but the view is worth it!', 'Steep trail, for sure... but well worth it. Some great views of Desolation, Tahoe and the Valley. The boys (10, 9, and 7) and I summmitted today. Take lots of water and a good hat, as shelter is scarce towards the top.', 'My favorite Hike. A great training hike, this will make you work for it.', 'Great trail. Gorgeous views. Unrelentingly steep to the top but a very manageable length. Did it with my 10 month old on my back and had a great time.', ""total butt-kicker. i wouldn't rate this as moderate- really. it's uphill and pretty steep in some sections the entire way. i'm a relatively fit person and i hike all the time and this still kicks my butt every time i do it. that being said if you're a triathlete or a serious athlete, it probably is a moderate hike for you. . but for the rest of us i would rate it as strenuous. it's really lovely though. .i mean the views from the summit are truly mind blowing and the wildflowers as you come out of the manzanita grove on the final ascent are really sweet (especially in AUGUST!) my caveat would be to bring a TON of water and drink it. i have done this hike twice this summer - and many others in between- and i have managed to become dehydrated both times. the first time i drank 96 ounces and this last time i drank 128 and still suffered symptoms.\ni would give it 5 stars on a not busy day but there were lots of people at the summit and there is very little room. one woman answered her phone and had a heated conversation right up there with the rest of us trying to enjoy nature. you would think that someone who appreciated nature would have some manners, but no- she didn't even try to move away from the top. just blocked our views and continued her conversation. most people were lovely though.\ni wouldn't recommend bringing your dog although many people did. if you are going to bring your dog, carry plenty of water for it and try to hit the trail before 8am. i am constantly dismayed by people hiking up and dragging their dogs in the heat of the day. just because they do it doesn't mean they are fine. dogs do die on trails bc owners don't know how to recognize signs of heat exhaustion and think that just giving them water will be enough. so if you are going to bring your dog - please make sure it is fit enough for the demands of the trail, go early, carry plenty of water and turn around if your dog shows signs of distress like excessive panting, seeking out shade, lying down and not wanting to move. \nfor us humans, also be sure you are fit. and if you are showing signs of exhaustion you should also turn around. the way down isn't much easier than the way up when your beat. \nthe trail forks right at the base of the final ascent. To the right it goes up steeply and it's shorter climb to the summit and to the left it meanders around with more switchbacks and is not as steep from what i hear but it is longer ( i also think that's the way you would go to get to lake aloha but am not 100% sure) . i took the right hand option and while it was very steep, it was only took about 30minutes to gain the summit from that junction (and i stopped to take some pictures along the way and chat with people resting on the side of the trail). not sure how long the other way would take. \nin any event, it's a really great workout/hike/view and a must do for those who like that sort of thing."", ""Great hike, easily accessible from highway 50. The trek up is steep at times, but the mileage is fairly short and I made it up in a little under 2 hours. Few water sources, if any, so bring enough with you. The summit has one of the  most complete views of Desolation that I've ever seen, amazing! Not much scrambling and the trail is pretty obvious the entire way up."", 'It was a rough hike but definitely worth the views. Uphill the whole way, probably should have read more reviews to prepare us. My husband and I did Mt. Tallac last summer and this was comparable in difficulty.', ""Beautiful!My friend and I are still beginners when it comes to bigger hikes so this one wore us out! The hike up was really steep but the views at the top were definitely worth it. We couldn't believe how breath taking it was up there. It took us 4 hours to get up (but again, we are beginners) and about an hour and a half to get down. A must-do/see for sure."", 'Hiked this Sat. July 29th, 2017.No snow on the trail at all!Stunning views from the top.We need to get some fresh sign in tablets in the cans on to. Practically every square inch is covered. Remember, drink plenty of water!', ""Took a group of 12 on a Saturday, and the hike exceeded my expectations. Not crowded at all and the views were absolutely stunning, you could see the entirety of Desolation Wilderness. Definitely steep and it's like a stair master all the way up. But because of the minimal mileage to the top, I'd agree it's moderate. We lost the trail a bit while on the loop because of the snow, but eventually found it again. Bring extra water!"", 'First significant hike, went solo at dawn. Beautiful, peaceful, difficult in places, well worth it. When you get to the split go left for slow longer and gradual rise, go right for much quicker but much steeper ascent.', 'Definitely a thigh burner.  Went out with a group of 7 ladies.  We all made it to the top, knowing the view would be worth.  Gorgeous up top and lost of butterflies flying around us.  Loved this one, and my favorite hike so far.  Will do this again.  This says it a ""moderate"" hike, we all agree it\'s more advanced.  The sign at Ralston Peak trail head, said it was ""difficult""', 'Loved it! Very beautiful views. Still a little snow so make sure to follow trail carefully. Log boxes when you get to the top.

Peak after peak can be seen from a relaxing rest on the flat top rocks. Do the hike, pack more water then you thought and enjoy the cool breeze at the top.', ""Starts out simple then it gets gravely and rocky in sections and steep, poles a good idea. You will definitely get a workout on this one! Currently few patches of snow near the top concealing the trail but otherwise clear. Awesome 360 degree view at the top. Lots of snow to the north still covering the various alpine lakes. Don't forget to look for the green military box to sign in."", 'Great views. Steep hike, but worth it. Last 1/3 through lots of snow. We kicked some steps, did mini glissades down. Poles or little spikes would have made it easier. Zephyr the Papillon wonder dog made it to the top with ease.', 'No real visible trail at the moment so consider this a cross country hike to the peak. Large snow drifts and exposed manzanita groves. Patchy icy snow so microspikes will be your friend. Brought snowshoes but only ended up using them at the very top. Have done this trail in summer and it was great.', 'View at the top is unbelievable. You might not realize it till you get to the very top. We almost returned after doing 90% of the trail( it was extremely cold and windy in October and the last section seemed like an unstable pile of rocks), but continued after seeing some ppl at the top (I am so grateful to them). It was totally worth it. Most of the trail is unshaded, so carry cap,shades and lots of water in summer and layers,gloves, etc in colder months.', ""It's not very scenic hike itself until you get to the peak. Strenuous. I didn't do the loop. I took the trail going straight up. Nice trail for downhill running. It took me 2h15min to the peak, return trip was just over an hour. 6.75miles round trip."", ""This hike was super steep getting up there, but the view was well worth it.

There is a small creek for water about 1/4 of the way up from a small trail that leads off from the main trail, but other than that there is NO WATER on this trail until you get over the summit.  We trekked up this trail 3 times before making it to the top.  1st time we started too late and had to head back, as we were unprepared for the dark and it was a day hike.  2nd time we decided to carry 40 lb. pack to camp just below the summit where the trail splits.  This was a beautiful night to camp, but we had no idea we would need so much water with carrying 40 lbs on our backs.  3rd time was the charm, as we made it a day hike and started earlier and brought our head lamps for the walk down.  Very blustery at the top and cold.  We picked a cooler day with overcast to hike to the top, but what a thrill.  We signed the ledger at the top.  Breathtaking views. Breathtaking hike.  Breathtaking.  Feeling accomplished.', ""Awesome climb with rewarding views.  I started at the Sacramento Camp parking lot and completed the out and back in ~5 hours.  Most beta suggests this is 5 mi out and back, but that distance is one-way; I clocked the round trip at 9.8 mi.  It's a quick climb from the parking lot with ~2800 ft in elevation gain to the peak.  The trail is unmarked but easy to follow at least until you reach the talus at the top, from there it is just a 100 ft or so to the summit. The trail is rated as easy. Being from the east coast and living at ~200 ft above sea level I huffed and puffed my way to the top and felt it in my legs the day after, so I'd rate this as moderate.  The views are well worth the effort giving you a bird's eye view of several lakes in the area.  If you add a 40 lbs pack to your back this would be a great training hike for bigger trips into the backcountry."", 'Great Views at the Top.  I left at 4 pm and was  back in the car at 9:15.

I took my 5 year old son here and we only made it I would guess about a mile in. The trail was sloped and tired him out quickly but for most adults it shouldn't be too difficult and its a nice little walk through the forest. Even though we didn't make it far once you reach the shoulder its easy to stray off the path a little for an awesome view of Lovers Leap and Horsetail Falls.

Very easy to find right off the road and you can park next to the road if the parking up the dirt road at the actual trailhead is full."", 'I went by myself to this one and started at 12:00 P.M on a saturday. Parked my car at Camp Sacramento, got the desolation wilderness day permit near the trailhead (Permit is free for day use and self issued). The weather was amazing and was mid 70s and beyond the tree cover there was a cool breeze. Most of the trail has tree cover except for the last mile or so. The last 100 feet or so near the summit was the best. The view was spectacularly beautiful. Totally worth the hard work. I did not see many people during the hike (saw about 15 people at max).', 'A friend and I did this on August 9, 2014.  My Health app showed the total distance at just over 7miles.  I would rate this as moderate to difficult.  The view from the top is spectacular with an outstanding view into the Desolation Wilderness.  There is a partial view of Lake Tahoe but it is small.', 'I would rate this hike as moderate to difficult. I loved it though! The views at the top are stunning and totally worth the effort.', ""My friend and I had planned an overnight trip up this trail. This was our first real backpacking trip, and we over-estimated our abilities. Between the altitude, over-weight packs and the fact that we just weren't in the greatest condition, we made it about halfway to our destination of Lake of the Woods.  With that said, the hike was invigorating, though a little intense. We set a slow pace, considering that we were new at this, but the constant incline wore at us.  The views were excellent. I'm hoping to try it again after I have built up for it a little better."", 'Hiked this trail for the first time today. Being from sacramento the drive is worth the reward. Not to far for some great views from the top. Not to long of a hike @ 2.7 and climbs @ 2400ft. Great training hill. The forest service did a great job on this trail in my opinion. ', ""If you love steep and switchbacks... This is the trail for you! An uphill challenge with a magnificent prize at the end. The TH begins at the Camp Sacramento parking lot and the majority of the trail is well marked. The first 1.5 miles are switchbacks through a red fir forest, leading to the Desolation Wilderness sign. The remaining portion of the trail, (1.5-2 miles) is a mixture of forest and granite with minor climbing over boulders in the last half mile. At the summit it's windy and cool, and a light jacket is recommended. The view is breathtaking and includes Lake Tahoe, Mount Tallac, Lake Aloha, Echo Lakes, Lake of the Woods, Pyramid Peak, Dick's Peak, many other lakes, all of Desolation Wilderness and the Tahoe basin. The view is totally worth the effort it takes to summit and  you need a strong heart (literally, not figuratively) and strong knees to reach it. Bring poles and lots of water!"", 'Gave this trail a try for the first of the year and was very impressed!  The views at the top are amazing.  There is hardly any snow on the top (1/1/12) and it was passable without snowshoes.  One point to note is that there are two routes to the top.  The topo only show one, the least steep, but longer route.  We got a little off trail on the way up, following the All Trails route, due to some snow drifts.  We found the other very clearly marked route on the way down (lots of trail ducks).  Also, we started at the parking lot across from Camp Sacramento which is just past Twin Bridges.', 'Being from Colorado I have ""High Standards"" for trails.  This wasn\'t bad at all but having since just moved, I as hoping for better.

You get a little of everything - rolling hills, rocky areas, and the greatest ocean view. I went midday on a Thursday, and it was not crowded at all - for the last 1/2 of the loop, I only saw three other people. \n\nIt’s rated as easy, but I would categorize it as moderate. I went on the first clear day after a few days of rain, so the ground was pretty muddy and there was a ton of loose rocks covering the few steep inclines. Some trail areas were non accessible due to huge puddles so I re-routed a couple times and made a few wrong turns along the way. Definitely added a little more adventure to the hike, which was fun! \n\nI parked in the Mori Point parking lot. It’s kind of small (only space for like 6 cars), but I think it’s the best starting point to the hike (rather than the start/end marked on the map.\n\nIt is SUPER windy, so make sure you bundle up with layers!

It's mostly fire road and dirt trails. Some areas are not maintained but there are clear trails to follow though. For places with steep inclines there is often a side route that's easier. You can take the hard way or wind around. Definitely recommended as an easy/moderate trail because you can customize the experience. I went at 11 on a Saturday and had no problems parking.

Did it in November on a rainy day. If that’s what you’re planning to do, then be aware that trail and stairs are wet and slippery. If you have appropriate shoes, it is absolutely fine. Views are spectacular, the only downside is how crowded this trail is. Once you reach last third of the trail, it is pretty narrow on the stairs, due to which you have to stop and get off a bit in order to let people come up or down. We really enjoyed it regardless of crowds and rainy weather. Didn’t go further just because we did not pack enough water with us and initially planned it to be a short trip. However, you can continue to Nevada Falls and and other spectacular trails.', 'Try to get an early start. The trail was very crowded until the half way point where most people turn around.', 'Kinda hard. Steep. Good.', 'Up the regular way and down through the John Muir trail. Wonderful views all the way.', 'Good hike, great views from the base of the Falls.  The steps are a pain because of the need to focus on each step.  It takes away from your ability take in the view on the way up.  However, once at the Falls you can take your time and soak it all in.Like other I recommend the Muir Trail down.  You continue to go up in elevation to meet the trail, but the amount of human trafficking (just traffic) on the stairs going down appears like rush hour on the  highway.  The JMT allows you to feel as though you are still in the wild.', ""This an absolutely gorgeous waterfall if you come in early spring when it is flowing at it's peak. If you wait until late summer, it  will still be flowing, but it is not as impressive. There are always a lot of people on this trail. Many of them stop at the bridge, but do yourself a favor and climb th steps next to the falls. They are uneven and wet, so make sure you have proper shoes on.  However, once you reach the top, you get a beautiful view of the falls and can also see Nevada Falls. This trail is paved for a good portion of it, but it is definitely steep and once you do the 300 steps next to the falls, no question you will be feeling it. But if you want to see the falls up close, you can't beat this trail."", 'The view of the falls at the top is worth it! I had been on this trail before but never to the top because of the kids, usually stopped at the bridge. The trail is very busy. There are a lot of uneven stone steps at the top. There are bathrooms and water fountains near the bridge, but no trash cans so pack it in and pack it out (including your banana & orange peels please).', 'Beautiful. We went up the Mist trail, and then took the Muir trail back. Glad we did. Longer and more climbing, but worth it.', ""While the Falls were beautiful, the Mist trail to the Vernal Falls was packed. At some points we were shoulder-to-shoulder. I think if you got there very early in the morning you'd be fine but we arrived at 10 and had to fight the crowds."", 'Beginning of September the waterfall was still flowing, but not roaring like it can in the Spring. The hike is very popular - so prepare for lots of people. Many stop at the bridge and turn back but I highly recommend climbing the stairs to the base of the falls.The little squirrels are so use to people and have learned to crawl into your packs for food! The stairs to the top of the falls are considered strenuous but WORTH IT! The view is breathtaking and there is lots more to explore at the top! **The bathrooms were working and there ARE water fountains by the bridge when I hiked. I refilled our water bottles on the way back down.', 'This is my second time doing Vernal Falls. The first time I went in mid-June and the falls were roaring with lots of water, mist, and rainbows. Absolutely spectacular. This last Labor Day weekend they were much drier but still flowing and beautiful. I had a chance to appreciate the rocks underneath the falls and it was nice to compare with my first visit. This is an easy hike with gentle slopes and lots of steps near the top of the falls. There’s a big pool up top that you can wade in if the water is just trickling and it hasn’t rained recently. Make sure it’s a super dry day so you don’t get washed out unexpectedly! I absolutely love this hike.', 'Amazing trail! easy to get to, with some hills and hard steps, but definitely worth it.', ""Fantastic trail. As it is a paved path I can understand why it is considered moderate; however... my wife mentioned several times during the ascent that it she thought it was anything but. I loved it any want to go all the way to Half Dome next time I'm in the area."", 'Wonderful hike. We went back by John Muir trail which give you a beautiful sight of the fall from above. Starting our hike at 8am we had the chance to see a bear and a bobcat on the trail.', 'This was such a beautiful experience! The steps right before the fall we’re a bit tough but you have to keep going it is well worth it!! I want to return!', 'Great hike! Totally worth the view at the top of Vernal. Heavy traffic mid day in June. Half way restrooms were closed and they took out the water fountain that used to be there so bring plenty of water. Over all a great hike:', ""Don't believe I haven't reviewed this one.  I've done it by itself without going higher twice.  The 1st time was with my wife.  Definitely in my personal top 10 for short hikes.  Only real downside is way too many people."", ""Good one, but do yourself a favor and push a little more to the next fall, and do the loop. It's worth it"", 'Such amazing views!!', 'I don’t recommend children. Very awesome hike.  Very rewarding at the end with the water fall and pool at the bottom.', 'Beautiful falls and you get close enough to get pretty soaked in the Spring months.  Lots of steps and they get really intense just before you reach the top of the fall, but the view from the top is so worth it.  If you feel up for it, I definitely recommend continuing to Nevada Fall and returning on the John Muir Trail.', 'Great trial with big uphills we tipped Vernal then came down JMT back to the bridge spectacular views.  If you go to top of falls be prepared to get wet', 'The first 30-45 minutes is straight up and somewhat difficult but the view at the bridge is worth it! You can do it!', 'I hiked Vernal Falls with my mom and daughter!

I did use my trekking poles but for this hike you don’t have to. The elevation gain is very gradual and comfortable. Remember stay left all the way up the mountain. You see fantastic views of Cucamonga and Mount Baldy from the top. At the top there is a 360 view! It was hot and there is no shade. There is a US geological Marker if you walk all the way to the end of the metal pallets on the floor to the edge toward the city is right there on the left side. This trail is dog friendly.

Fog rolled in and the mountain played with it. I will have to do this again for the views.', ""I enjoyed a wonderful hike today to Sunset Peak. The weather from the city was gloomy, socked in by cloud cover. But a quick drive up Mt Baldy Road and I was above the clouds, full of sun. Temperature at the Glendora Ridge Road parking lot was 54˚ with little to no breeze. Perfect for this hike.\n\nTrail activity was light, on the way up I think I met four hikers and three mt bikers. The view from the peak was awesome and I had it all to myself. I decided to take the fire break path back down to the trailhead and that was quite an adventure. The trekking poles came in very handy with the loose rocks, large boulders, and steep terrain going this route. It took awhile to make my way down (and up a few times), but it made the hike more interesting in the end.

Beautiful view of San Gabriel Valley.', ""For a more challenging route to Sunset Peak than the one depicted here, drive north on San Dimas Canyon Rd and park near the small structure by the dam. Directly east, hidden behind a short line of highway dividers is a trailhead for the Sunset Ridge Truck Trail. It's a 25-mile out and back to Sunset Peak with some nice views along the way. The trail takes you along the ridge above Claremont Hills and Potato Mountain, past the cluster of antennae atop the ridge, and then north to the peak. You can see the truck trail on the All Trails map--it is shown as a continuation of the Sunset Peak Trail. For runners, the vast majority of the 25 miles is runnable, with a couple short sections that you might want to hike. 4.5-5 hours to run this route. Cumulative elevation gain in the first 12.5 miles of the run is probably around 4600 feet."", ""This is an easy hike with a wide road, there are some spots that the road is so packed with rocks it's a little difficult to walk on.

BEWARE: though this is standard operating procedure when being out in nature, we ABSOLUTELY heard a very deep growl right at the 1.5mile mark seemingly coming from a stand of trees down the hill to the left. Bear or cougar, who knows... That and the waning sunlight helped our decision to head back to the trailhead promptly. Would definitely go again, but definitely with protection from wild beasts.', 'We did this hike on November 2014 with our Boy Scout Troop as part of our Mini Peak Bagger program.

It's definitely a good place to catch the sunset and the trail is easy enough to follow that you can hike back down it in the dark pretty easily. In the group I was in there were a few who stopped every 50 feet, so we ended up splitting up various times. I took the shortcut up for the last part of the summit, so when I headed down the fire road going back down I missed a turn and ended up going down for about 15 min on the wrong side of the mountain.  I had to double back almost a mile to get back on the right path. Once I did that it was an easy walk down.  It got dark with about 30 minutes left, but since I had a headlamp and flashlight I was fine.  There is an abundance of shade and great views of Baldy and the San Gabriel Mountains from the top.\n\nCheck out the trip here!\nhttp://youtu.be/h8WK1LevHBk"", ""This was a really nice hike. We took the service road about 3 miles up and then took a steep trail up to the top rather than continue on the road. That was the only difficult part of the trail and we made the choice to do it. The views from up top were great. The clouds had cleared and we had some great vistas. We came down the road which was filled with broken rock from landslides. Eventually you get to a junction were the road continues on to another peak, I think Johnstone. We choose to go back to Glendora Ridge Rd and the car. The trail was a nice easy incline, about 3.5 or so miles each way. We looked for the other shorter, steeper trail but didn't find it. Still it was an enjoyable morning and a great hike. I'll definitely be back.

It will definitely give you a workout as the trail is constantly but gradually climbing up. The trail is very secluded (we were the only ones on it). We hiked it in late afternoon in time to be at the summit for sunset, this made the views that much better, and we're still back at the car by dark."", 'I love Sunset Peak. When there is new snow just come here.The upper part of Baldy road gets hoards of people and Sunset will be empty.', ""There are a couple ways up there. I recommend the short and steep one as it stays on a ridge the whole way to the peak, a former fire lookout site, affording great views the entire hike. Trailhead: Just before you get to Mt. Baldy Village, turn left on Glendora Ridge Rd. and head up a mile to a parking area on the right (the lot is private so park there on the roadside. Right there on the left is the trailhead, looking as though it heads straight up. The trail follows the ridge up and down for only a mile and a half, but gains 1,400' in the process; though short it's still a pretty good workout. There's a dirt road all the way to the peak which, again, is private (permission to use it has been granted in the past by carrying a card you can print out at the Sierra Club's Hundred Peaks Section website). The road is a good, albeit longer, alternative for descending (you'll cross the road twice while on the trail). It begins a few feet up from the trailhead.

That's an amazing piece of architecture at the end. It's definitely worth it for that and for the opportunity to spend some time lazing on the shore of the stunning Emerald Bay."", 'Easy hike, lots of people, beautiful views.', 'Boring walk, but worth it when you get the beach at the end.', 'A great trail to go with kids. Really nice views of Emerald Bay. We went with a 1.5 and 3.5 year old and they really enjoyed it, especially the beach at the end! It’s very easy on the way down, and steep on the way up (for just about a mile, so totally doable!) Arrive early for parking! Parking area is $10.', 'super super steep but so pretty... it really is worth the hike back up', 'Hiked this up from Vikingsholm after completing Rubicon Trail. Ascent very steep.', 'Fun & easy hike! I even saw families with little ones (ranging ages 4-10ish), so good for family fun. It’s currently off season right now, but during season (I wanna day it’s Memorial Day to Labor Day? Ish?) you can take a tour of the Vikingsholm Estate. Definitely planning on going back for that! Beautiful views!', ""I loved the history and melancholy this place brought, to spend a summer in the forest nestled between majestic mountains and the gorgeous blue Tahoe, what could be more relaxing from our hectic lives! I hope you can find close by parking outside the fee area and ready yourself to descend down into history. The tour was simple and short with quick photo ops but your $10 goes to a good cause to protect history as well as the beauty of the area. the missing 5th Star is for the crazy crowds! timing is everything to avoid the worst of it. I hike because I love solitude in creation which this does not provide, so go for the history and not the adventure of the hike. it was a nice little work out to push yourself at 90 to 100% of your effort back up the hill and then you'll feel you've accomplished it all, just don't run over the other tourists struggling up the hill, they deserve a great experience too!"", 'Nice, easy to walk trail, a little steep, but well worth it when you see the Vikingholm mansion, beautiful architecture, and spectacular views. Very nice little beach out front (bring your swim suites)', 'A good family hike on a gorgeous day in Tahoe. Reliable shoes a must as the gravel trail was easy to slip. Our 5&7 yr olds held up well. Took the Vikingsholm tour and walked along the beach before ascending.', 'Beautiful view of Emerald Lake. The castle was very unique. Easy walk down harder to walk up.  I would do it again for the kayaking out to the island. Where good shoes do not use flip-flops.', 'Great walk down to house but going up check your heart rate', 'A good trail to see Emerald Bay and Vikingsholm from up close. Fairly easy with a moderate climb back to the parking lot.', 'Arrive early for parking! There are many places along the road outside the parking area and you’ll save $10. There are trails on the South Lake Tahoe side so you don’t have to feel you’re walking in traffic. Nice hike with many excellent viewpoints and photo ops. It’s pretty much one long switchback down to the beach area where you can picnic, swim and enjoy the views of emerald bay. Be sure to take a tour of the house and get it’s history!  There is also a short (0.3 mi) hike starting from the gift shop to the base of eagle falls. There are stairs but they are well cut and the falls are well worth it. Be prepared for that long switchback out. It is very doable. Wear good shoes!  The climb back can be hot and sun exposed midday and early afternoons', 'Get there early to find parking. This trail starts downward and connects with Rubicon.  Beautiful waterfall.  The hike back was up hill yuck', 'We couldn’t get a parking spot near the trail entrance, but once we parked further down around the bend it made more sense to walk down the paved carriage road that joins up with the Rubicon trail. It made for a longer hike — almost the length of Emerald Bay— but the views from above were amazing. We enjoyed touring the house which seems to have had some recent restoration— it looks great. I also appreciate that the gift shop by Vikingsholm now has some snacks. The ice cream treats helped power us back up the hill! There are some amazing campsites along the Rubicon trail. A great day.', 'Short, easy hike, Emerald Bay was cold to swim in which was really nice during the summer. Also came during the winter when it was snowing, beautiful.', ""Short but sweet.  Hiking out was a bit of a chore due to the grade and, after swimming all day, we were feeling it.  We passed two guys hauling an ice chest full of fish back up, bless 'em.  Totally worth it to swim in the bay and sit by the trees."", 'I had been wanting to hike down to the castle for some time now but I chose the wrong day. I arrived at 9am and it was so heavily trafficked with all the end-of-summer vacationers that it took me almost an hour just to find parking. Besides that reservation, it is a short but sweet trail descending down to the beach with stunning, scenic views. There was a bit of incline coming back up but nothing too challenging. I would definitely do it again on a less busy day.', 'Awesome views of the lake. Beautiful forest scenery. Mostly down hill one way. Nice treasure at the end Vikingholm was breathtaking. would definitely recommend.', 'This trail is really easy for an active person. The terrain is flat and easy to walk on and the trail is very obviously marked. There are restrooms available as well which is nice. Love the water at the bottom and the short walk up to eagle falls! This is definitely doable in regular running shoes and great for kids. I did this with my son when he was 3 years old and again 5 years later.', 'Easy hike but worth the trip to see the beautiful Vikingsholm at the bottom.', 'Loved it. Was kinda hard for me but I’m out of shape. Did this in 2015.', 'Easy paved hike with amazing and iconic view of Emerald Bay. Relatively steep uphill to return to starting point.', ""A fun little hike. First your hike down which is easy. Then you hike back up. Beautiful lakeside views at the bottom along with the castle. The uphill is definitely difficult but relatively short. I would say it's a moderate hike. I saw a lot of children and older people doing it just at a slower pace. More can be found on my blog (https://www.brisul.com/blog/2017/6/22/vikingsholmtrail)"", 'Nice easy trail to walk on. The incline is steep coming back up but the path is smooth.', 'Vikingsholm is a joy to descend. The level of enjoyment of the ascension is dependent on how much cardio you do. In all seriousness this trail contains some spectacular views and the house at the bottom is truly unique. As with other trails in the area parking is a premium so arrive early or expect to drive around waiting for a spot.', 'Did this hike 5-3-18 hardly anyone there. I did get there early around 9:30 am plenty of parking. I parked a bit up the road to avoid the 10 dollar fee. This hike was not as hard as it was stated or sounding. Granted I do hike some what frequently the incline was not really that bad at all. Made it back up pretty quick and there are plenty of places to rest should you need it. When you get to the bottom you can access the water which is nice. Never saw the house or whatever I was on a time constraint and wanted to enjoy the water and views. Great little hike early enough in the season I was basically alone the whole time. More people and the parking lot was pretty full by noon.', 'Fantastic and unique landmark!!! Loved seeing the architecture and beach views and the island!! Also had immediate access to Eagle falls and the Rubicon trail!!!', 'Great weather when we visited, great views of emerald lakeGoing back up is steep', 'Great trip,Limited parking, a must see castle! Thanks', 'I was huffing and puffing on my way back up (I blame it on the altitude) but it was worth the views!! Lots of kids, being carried, and plenty of dogs.', 'Beautiful views of Emerald Bay! My husband and I were able to complete it with our 2.5 year old in his pack and our 2 month old in my front carrier. It was a little tougher on the way up because it’s pretty steep, but definitely doable. You can continue on the trail down to emerald bay and see Vikingsholm castle. We brought lunch and ate at one of the picnic tables. Vikingsholm is only open to tour in the summer, but it’s still beautiful to see.', ""Hiking down pavement isn't my forte- lots of non hikers on this one. The view and being right on Lake Tahoe is awesome and gets you right up to the shoreline. We continued to Emerald point which is more of a trail with minimal elevation change. Back tracked up to parking lot. The elevation going back up to the parking lot is the challenge and can get you out of breath if your not physically fit."", 'Beautiful views of Lake Tahoe, Emerald Bay, and Vikingsholm. Easy hike down; slightly more strenuous going back up, but well worth it!', 'Very pretty hike. Easy. Great views of Lake Tahoe and several waterfalls. Great for all ages and skill levels.', 'Nice short and relatively easy hike. Fairly steep trail with nice views of Emerald Bay and takes you to the coastline where you can check out a beautiful mansion once owned by a wealthy landowner and now by the parks service (There are tours available in the summer every half hour.). Parking is $10.', ""Parking is difficult at this time due to one row of the parking lot being worked on, so arrive early if you can in order to get a spot.If you are someone whom doesn't like the heat, the return hike is better done in the morning because there is very little shade on upper part of the trail.The trail is nice and wide and is definitely down all the way and UP all the way back.The view of the bay at the bottom.of the trail is very nice.We did the home tour and it was a nice, simple tour.  You pay $10 to park & $10/person to do the tour.The $10 is worth it for the tour.  Make sure to take the time to do the .5 mile hike to Lower Eagle Falls.It's a beautiful little waterfall."", 'about 1 Mike each way from the parking lot, the uphill on the way back is a pretty  good workout. be sure to hike eagle falls which is another quarter mile past the vikingsholm.', 'Though labeled as ""caution, steep"" this trail is Easy-Moderate. A wide, well groomed path leads down 1.0 miles to the castle, a dock and paths around the bay. Absolutely worth the return trip uphill (a solid incline walk that\'ll warm you right back up if it\'s chilly out). Great trail to take to admire the beauty of the bay up close.', 'Parking is a fiasco, but it is absolutely worth it! Emerald Bay is stunningly beautiful. Vikingsholm is incredibly unique and something to see. The hill to get down to it may be a bit steep for some on the way back up, but just keep putting one foot in front of the other!', 'Scenic walk ... parking hardest thing ... not enough spaces.', 'This is a beautiful easy down hill hike to the beach and Rubicon Trail and Vikingholm. Hike back up trail is strenuous for a 71 year old. Took one hour to go .8 miles, with stops to rest back and hips. But overall this a good hike and worth the pain.', 'Steep one-mile climb down and back.  The top of the trail provides some striking views of the bay and other features.  Vikingsholm itself is nicely preserved and has been well maintained by California State Parks. The tour is just the right length, and the history discussed is very intriguing.', ""This was the first time my family and I decided to do a hike on July 26, 2017. The walk was easy to get to the castle, but it was closed and didn't open until 10:30a.m so we decided to walk about 5-10 more minutes to check out Eagle falls and it was so worth it. The waterfalls were beautiful! We started the trail at 8:15a.m and it was not crowded, but by the time we were heading back around 9:30a.m people were arriving and parking was getting hectic so I recommend arriving before 9:00a.m. The walk back had some uphills, but was manageable. I saw people of all ages and there are plenty of benches to stop and rest when needed. I recommend this trail to any beginner hiker. Definitely check out Eagle Falls!"", 'Easy 1 mile hike down to Emerald Bay Vikingsholm and beach.  Very chill.', 'The sign at the start that says ""steep trail"" was a little bit misleading, at least for me.  A very fast, easy hike down to a beautiful grass-covered castle and popular beach area.  If you\'re looking for a quiet and solitary hike this one is not for you.  But if you don\'t mind a lot of people then this hike is fast, easy, kid friendly, and fun!  Definitely recommend for the scenery at least.', 'Nice wide paths make this an easy trail. lots of foot traffic and grassy beach area at the bottom. kayaks available for rent.', 'fun hike', ""For a more interesting hike to Vikingsholm, I recommend starting at the eagle point campground. There is plenty of parking, the trail is more scenic, and less steep. The trail to Vikingsholm from eagle point is 2 miles each way and includes eagle falls. I thought the tour was overpriced. For $10 each, it's 20 minutes guided and 10 minutes wandering around."", 'Beautiful view of emerald bay', ""It's a beautiful hike. There are many great views along the way. There is an extra hike up to Eagle Falls that is worth it."", 'Tough walk up but interesting castle', 'We were disappointed in the ""castle"" home, but it was still a beautiful walk.', 'Very nice afternoon walk,the way up the like from to the parking lot is a challenge.no matter how many times,the walk up still a challenge.!', 'Great hike with an amazing castle home at the bottom! We did the tour of the home and it was really cool! Beautiful views of Emerald Bay on the way down. Go early and beat the crowds, after 10 parking becomes difficult!', ""Trail isn't much, a few views but worth the steady downhill to see Vikingsholm and the lake views. Steady uphill on the way back."", 'Parking lot is small. We got there early. Fills up fast on a Sat. Steep incline down, then follows the lake. Continue on .4 for Eagle Falls.', 'I love this trail. Fantastic for all seasons, snow or not!\nToday there was a nice thunderstorm rolling through, really added to the mild temperature!', 'By British standards, this is just a walk (sorry, a mile each way is not a Hike) down then up a moderately steep hill, but nice enough scenery with an impressive house at the bottom.', 'Ok. Really just a graded road. Sort of steep', ""We took our 2 toddler children. It was great going down to the lake. Really adventurous for them. Not so great on the way back up. And since it's the holiday weekend traffic was horrendous and people were brutal with parking spots. But the scenery was great and the kids made it through. Lots of people with children as well."", 'Make sure you continue your hike south, on the Rubicon Trail, to see both sets of falls. Gorgeous.', 'Easy and beautiful trail. The weather was good , which it made my hiking more enjoyable.', 'Kid friendly walk down to the beach. Easy to go at your own pace and amazing views.', 'Nice trail with small waterfalls on the way. Beautiful trees. Beautiful home on the exterior with fairytale like wood carved door. Was closed for winter. Nice views of Emerald Bay Cove.', 'Nice short hike. It was steep enough to get me sweating but not a tough climb for in shape people. There are very small waterfalls as you move down the trail. There are picnic tables near the beach. I had lunch on a drift wood tree that washed up. The view of emerald bay is beautiful as you hike down.', 'Stunning views, very well maintained trail. Great to have bathroom facilities at the bottom! Would definitely do it again!', ""Bring your swimsuit and try to time the hike back up later in the day when it's cooler."", 'A beautiful short hike to Vinkingholm and Eagle Falls. Very well maintained and clean. The traffic on the trail was moderate.', ""I thought this was a great trail. We hiked this today with our two year old riding in my backpack. Super easy walk down and a relatively easy ascent back to the top. We didn't realize that Vikingsholm castle is right on the beach. It's beautiful. We should have brought our bathing suits and a picnic along with us. Once we reached the bottom there were restrooms and a small store with a few souvenirs and ice cream. We enjoyed the tour of Vikingsholm and then took the 0.3 mile trek up to Eagle Falls as well. It was a lovely day and a relatively easy hike. I think this is marked as moderate simply b/c of the walk back to the top, which was not trying at all. We didn't really need to stop on our way back to the top but there was plenty of shade and cool spots to stop as a small stream runs along the path. This is a very popular and manicured trail. The write-up lists this as a 1.7 mile trek. It's actually one mile down to Vikingsholm, 0.3 miles from Vikingsholm to Eagle Falls and of course, 1.3 miles from Eagle Falls back to the parking lot."", 'Easy path to hike, see the beautiful home at the lake, picnic, swim, and boat! I sat on the beach and enjoyed the view of the rising mountains on either side!', 'Pretty easy and not too bad coming back up. Recommend the tour of the home. Also, the hike to Eagle Falls was worth it. Come early (before 9 am) to get decent parking and to avoid the crowds - very packed today.', 'Now this is the way to enjoy Tahoe. We did the castle tour at the bottom, a must! Then hiked to the bay point for picnic lunch just past the boat camp. That was an easy flat hike.', 'The trail was nice and wide so it made it easy to pass others. Also had a great view at the top. Going Dow was easy on the way out is a little steep in places', 'We hiked this after Eagle Lake and Eagle Falls, the 1 mile stroll down to the bottom at Emerald Bay was easy; it was a beautiful day and crowded.  We walked out on the dock, enjoyed the beach a bit, and walked around the castle.  Then we hiked back up, a bit more of a workout than coming down, but still a fairly easy walk.  The views at the observation area are awesome and were not crowded.  Enjoy just hanging out on the rocks.  You must do this hike if you are visiting Tahoe.', 'Every trip to Tahoe should include a  hike to this amazing location! Look for the Vikingsholm trailhead off of 89, you cant miss it. Its a short but sweet hike down to the bay and the water is sparkling clear that glows faintly turquoise, in fact its called Emerald bay,in the center of the bay there is a island with what looks like a miniature stone tower on it.The most surprising feature of this area however is the Scandinavian, medieval- era inspired Castle/mansion that has been preserved here! You can easily get caught up in observing the fine craftsmanship put into this structure for hours, the mansion interior may even be explored if you wish too.The only thing else they could add here is maybe a Drakkar gliding over the shining waters in the bay. ;). Not only do you get to see this incredible structure but the surrounding environ is intense as well.A huge Ponderosa towers nearby, water cascades down the back of the mountain and into the bay,decomposing granite makes for a white sand type shoreline, the whole area is very impressive, be sure to check it all out..This place is really fantastic, my only complaint is- crowds are heavy, parking can be a huge problem,in fact expect that you may not even be able to find a place to park...-and- the fee to enter Vikingsholm mansion proper is way overpriced.. this place would receive 5 stars if not for the populace problem. Many people there were not even hikers or outdoor enthusiasts of any sort and did not  appreciate the steep hike.Veteran hikers  should consider taking one of the outlying trails that lead to the castle for a more serene experience and a chance to explore more.', 'This was a beautiful hike. I was easy for the whole family. This is a great place to take the family for the day to have a nice picnic. While you are there explore the house.', ""If looking for a great hike I wouldn't choose this. But if you are interested in touring the house it's totally worth it. The trip up is steep but not very long."", 'Pretty steep trek back up, but the home at the bottom is beautiful & worth the walk.', 'More like a really steep mile long driveway from the parking lot to Vikingsholm, but some good views of the west end of Emerald Bay.  Took the trail in order to get to the Rubicon Trail.', 'Beautiful hike down to a magnificent castle.  Castle tour was not operating when we were there, so plans are to go back.  Beautiful drive to get there.  Great views of Emerald Bay.', 'Not really a ""hike"" down to the house - the walk down and back is on a road - but it\'s lovely any time of the year. The house is beautiful (talk about location!! what a view!) Tourists make it hard to park during the high season - during the winter and bad weather it\'s much easier. If you get there early enough that helps too. Well worth the time.', 'Although short, this trail is steep as you will notice on the hike back up to the parking lot. The castle is fascinating and in a beautiful setting. I have approached the castle many times by boat but walking the trail gives you a completely new perspective of this beautiful part of Lake Tahoe.', 'First time hiking in an attempt to get out and be more active. Not a very long distance but rather steep on the way back up. Many places to rest, however, for those of us not-so-physically-fit individuals. ;). Vikingsholm itself is amazing!', 'We went once in mid-summer and once in late summer.  We started from the Vikingsholm Castle and headed south around Emerald Bay the first time.  Once you are about a mile down, the crowds thin out to nothing.  We had the trail to ourselves out to the lake.  The second time we headed north. There were more people hiking this direction than the other, but I felt both were equally beautiful.', ""We went in early May and it was already getting crowded.  Getting down is easy but coming up can be difficult if you aren't in shape or the altitude gets you (my 6 year old made it, but needed a couple brief shoulder rides).  The Vikingsholm is a neat destination and there are picnic tables and facilities at the bottom.  I reccomend doing this int he off season when the crowds aren't so bad."", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '',

We did the Loop counterclockwise, which gave us some amazing views while making the climb up to the Mine.', 'Moderate hike, fantastic views. Definitely recommend hiking clockwise to take advantage of the view', 'Fine it several times. Easy hike. Nice mine at the end.', 'Our favorite hike in the park, highly recommended! I’d rate this as moderate difficulty, short sections with some rapid ascent / decent, but overall mild. Nice variety of scenery throughout the hike, expansive views towards the east after the mine, lots of interesting flora / fauna throughout the hike. We hiked clockwise, from the trailhead starting at the parking lot, which is definitely the easier direction. Go the opposite way for more challenge. Either way, do yourself a favor and do the entire loop. Most hikers went to mine and turned around, but they missed out on the best part of the hike. The access road is not paved, but any vehicle should be able to navigate it.', 'Nice historic hike. Tagged hard but definitely EASY', '', 'Love this hike. Gorgeous views. The parking is on a dirt road off the main road so if you don’t have 4 wheel drive just be aware (I have a corolla and drove very carefully).. Decent uphill work out. I have actually been inside the mine (there was a hole in the fence and couldn’t help myself). If you search carefully enough inside you will find a treasure. Graffiti from someone who was in a very famous band who passed away (I don’t want to say- you will have to look for yourself. It is on the ledge above the stairs). I felt reluctant to say anything because I don’t want anyone to be disrespectful to the mine or get hurt. But it is truly a treasure to see. !ALSO WANTED TO NOTE that while walking off the trail up to the mine, my friend walked close enough to a *RATTLESNAKE* to cause it to rattle. It was 5-6 feet long. So just be aware that they are up there. !', 'Great hike.   Beautiful vistas.  I’d avoid it during peak heat hours, but still very doable with good supply of water.

There were definitely bees, but they don’t bother you if you do t bother them!', 'Really pretty hike! There are a couple steep parts but it’s really not that bad. Well worth the views and pretty wildflowers. Also true what someone else wrote about the bees, they sure like to hang around you so be careful.', 'Loving his trail? A great lookout from the mine and further on at about the halfway point. Some challenges with the elevation to keep it interesting, slow and steady the way up. Nice, flat finish - would do again.', ""A great little loop trail. More easy/mod than hard/mod for the more seasoned hikers, but I enjoyed taking it at a more strident pace. The parking lot is small - it fits maybe 11-12 cars, so either go to the end to park and wait til someone leaves or park alongside the entrance road on a pull off. The bees were bountiful and boisterous- both in the trailheads bathroom ( pee behind a bush off the trail instead) and throughout the hike. Divine, but those who are allergic bring an epi pen. We enjoyed a very buzzy lunch together on the trail. The mine didn't look impressive, so I skipped it - there are several trail turnoffs by it, so pay attention to the signs at the junctions to ensure you're staying the right course."", 'Great scenery changes, never got bored.

Best route is to go clockwise, hiking first to the mine and then continuing on to complete the 6.5 mile total loop.  The trail is easily followed and well traveled.', 'Get to the parking lot early like around 8:30am. The lot was empty save for 2 other vehicles. Wait an hour and it will be tough to find parking. Wanting to do the mine trail (4 mile there and back), we actually started the trail at the trailhead that is near the lot entrance which is the loop trail. This took us to the huge 6-mile loop and we are so happy we did it.

Simply amazing!', 'Fun trip, the mine structure is a fun place to have lunch...', ""This is a highly underrated hike, and one of my favorites.  Parking was crowded but the trail was nearly empty.

Don't skip this one!"", 'Nice diverse hike.  Great views. Mine is really cool. Loved the Joshua trees', 'Great hike! We went clockwise and it took us about 3 hours with plenty of stops.

Soft sand in some areas adds to the exercise value.', 'Great trail, well maintained. Easy loop and well marked.', 'Nice November weather. Full trail is recommended. Completed in 2.5 hours.', 'Really enjoyed this trail. Grateful we went clockwise and went to the mine first since the last mile is Sandy riverbed and just tired us out. Lots of fun switchbacks and beautiful views. Signage was a little sparse in the riverbed, luckily you can just look down and follow the footprints.', 'Hiked this trail clockwise starting around 5:45pm in July and took it slow. Really enjoyed the plants and creatures! Saw only one other hiker and they were leaving the mine. Definitely hot and strenuous in the beginning but around the mine it was late enough there was lots of shade from the mountains. There are signs that say day use only but we were able to leave the parking lot fine after 9pm.', 'It is a moderately hard hike, with nice views of the valley and park, but the last stretch of it is on flat ground and nothing but dirt and Joshua trees, not much to see at the end.

Really not much to see on this hike.  Some nice views at about the 3 mile mark but that's it.  A little elevation gain over the first 1.5 miles but really not very steep.  The the last 2miles (?) are a just plain boring as you trudge across sand (in and out of a wash) with really nothing to see.  The trail is very well marked...took 2:15 to do the loop, I'm generally a faster than average hiker.My recommendation would be to go past the mine about a mile and then turn back.   Mid June, mid-90s, Breezy, no shade.  Bring a couple of liters of water"", 'nice hike with a few steep parts.  make sure you bring water as the trail has no shade.  once we arrived at the mine we hiked up the hill behind it and the views were amazing!  if you dont want to do the full loop you can hike to the mine and back and that is 4 miles.  to complete the loop is 6 miles', 'Easy day hike. A good loop trail for families with children.', ""A little difficult in the beginning due to it being very uphill, but once you get past the first part, it's a pretty easy hike. It was very windy when we went which was a little more challenging with the cold breeze blowing in our faces. Once we made it to the mine, we stopped and had lunch in an area where there was no wind. A little sad that the mine is gated off, but I understand it's for safety reasons."", ""This hike was a little rough in the beginning maybe just because I haven't hiked in a while but once you get about halfway through it's just a level path the rest of the way. We had so much fun on this hike and would def do it again. We were able to see a few bighorn sheep and jackrabbits. Bring plenty of water if you plan on doing the full loop, and snacks! The only downside was that the parking lot was on the smaller side so we had to drive all the way back to main road and walk to the start of the trail which added probably another mile to our hike!"", ""Nice hike with good vista views, but we didn't find the horse.

For me however the highlight of this hike was on the far eastern part of the hike when you're on the side of the mountain looking out towards the plains of Joshua Tree. There is something special about not seeing anything manmade for miles and miles."", ""It's a must do! The hike is relatively easy, not technical just lengthy but the work is rewarded by the old Mine."", 'Really nice. My first experience of hihing at desert.', 'Pretty scenery.  This trail is in Joshua Tree National Monument and there is no dogs allowed on the trail and people did not follow the rules, making it hard to enjoy how peaceful the hike was.', ""I did this one starting at 2am. It's a great little hike. The mine itself is surrounded by barbed wire so that's kinda a buzz kill. You can hike the hill to the top, and look down on the mine. Overall a nice little hike for the exercise."", 'Great hike to the Lost Horse Mine. Most people turn around and head back from there, but continuing on the loop is worth it! Very quiet and great views of Pleasant Valley and the park.', ""A great moderate trail with pleasant views of the park's midsection in the distance. NOT the greatest scenery in the park but good if you're not looking for steep climbs. Fencing around the mine site is depressing but it's obviously been graffittied badly in the past. Worth doing the whole loop but to the mine and back the same way for a shorter hike it's still a good stretch."", 'This is a great option for a moderate hike in Joshua Tree. However, this app is misleading - dogs are NOT allowed. You risk a ticket from the ranger if you bring your dog anywhere outside of the campgrounds in a national park. I have done the trail to the mine and back (4 miles r/t) several times, but just recently did the full loop and it was WORTH IT.

That was nice.', 'Good trail back loop is flat and dull', 'Good trail, the back end was boring', ""This was the first time I seen a gold mine location.

It mostly a nice workout walk."", ""The mine itself is very cool, but the hike is pretty uneventful.  Great views and we even had some snow on the side of the trail but other than that it's just a walk along a fire-type road.

We then rejoined the PCT hiking towards Winston Ridge and continued on the PCT until it returned to our starting point. This route is about 5.5 miles and has an elevation gain of about 1300 feet. I would estimate that about half of the trail was snow covered. It was a very enjoyable hike. I gave it four stars only because there was only one spot that gave a good vista view.', 'Hike is nice except for the 2 miles on the road. No shade on the road, so pretty harsh in the summer.', 'Okay. AllTrails could use a ""this campground costs money"" marker, somehow. I mean, I could of looked up but myself before, but didn\'t even think about it. And if you want a good back country camp experience, stay away from Buckhorn camp. We should of set up shop at Cooper Canyon Camp, went to the falls & came back for the evening. My video on YouTube is on my channel, Outdoor Corn.\n\nStarted off at the trailhead, went into the canyon & made it to the falls. For those who had trouble, so did we, but it\'s a matter of following the stream/creek bed to the junction of Buckhorn Camp & the PCT - just past the 2.7 mile mark on this map, moving on the PCT route. Very quickly you will  find a couple precarious looking paths to the left & if you head down, you\'ll find the ropes that lead you into the pool. We had it to ourselves & it was very enjoyable! Some tiny fish. A little moss. Some drip-drops from the falls...very nice. After that, we made our way to Buckhorn Camp...which, is the campground I wanted to visit, but when we got there, found it to be a ""car camping"" place. Ended up walking back to our car because we didn\'t bring cash (all spots were full anyway).\n\nOverall good experience, great trail, but not having a place to camp was disappointing, since that was the main reason for our trip.', 'this Trail can get a little confusing because it runs into buckhart Trail and Burkhart Trail and they all come out of Buckhorn so the signs confused us a little and we missed the waterfall on the way down but we found it on the way back they could use a  few more signs but it was a beautiful hike. it should be a lot better once we get some rain fall in the campgrounds are nice too', 'Awesome walked, loved the scenery and the waterfall was wonderful.', ""We did this to escape the heat in L.A.  \nDid the loop counter-clockwise from the last turnout before Bukhorn entrance.  It's simply a matter of keeping a leftward tangent.  Started at 5:30 pm and finished at 9:15 pm.   It being July, we used a lot of repellent.  \nVery beautiful hike, especially with the low angle sunlight, and plenty of shade.  But forget the falls.  It was just too dry.  As the evening sky set in, we took the PCT out of Cooper Canyon instead of the service road.  It was worth it because as the trail gets up on to the rim of the canyon, you can see a lot of sky and surrounding mountains with that blue and orange colored sky.  We had the trail all to ourselves.\nThe loop is closer to 8 miles than 6 because we took the trail instead of the service road coming out of Cooper Canyon trail camp.

Did the complete Loop and More Total 8.9 Miles. I love it.', 'This hike is pretty intense because it’s all a constant uphill. It does loop around, however you do walk up a campground and through a driving entrance and walk on the HWY for about half a mile. It totals up to 7.5-8 miles total. Not 6. It’s a great workout, great views, but TAKE LOTS AND LOTS Of water and snacks. Took about 5-6hrs to complete.', 'This loop has a ways on the busy main highway and on a paved road through Buckhorn Campground, so not the most ideal. The canyon views are great though and lots of conifers and wildflowers to see along the way.', ""This was a very hard hike that almost ended in a search party. Like an episode of survivor  my boyfriend and I running out of water and almost fighting each other for food due to getting lost because of the lack of clearly marked trails. Almost died from heat stroke and as the sun set in the canyon video filmed our final goodbyes to our families as we surely thought we would die. Took four hours to hike back out. Never found the falls and by time we made it back to the car we both looked like Tom Hanks in castaway. Not recommend if you are not an avid hiker. Extremely windy hills with little to no markings. Unless you have Tonto with you or were a producer on Bear Grills's show I would leave this one alone. If you are hard pressed and will go anyways, make sure someone goes with you so you have something to eat when you get lost as we found squirrels are quite fast and beetles taste like shit. Good luck."", 'I love this trail!  The mountain scenery, redwoods, forest, waterfall, creek and all, is just spectacular.  Well worth the drive.

A little snow left on the hillsides, but the trail is very dry.', ""Great trail. Make sure once you cross the little creek, hang left and you'll run into the water fall about a quarter of a mile from the main trail.

This is a year-round waterfall and water flow depends on rain season. This waterfall is easy to miss and the first time I tried finding Cooper Canyon falls I ended up at Burkhart Saddle.  You take Burkhart trail all the way down to you get to the Pacific Crest Trail Junction and make a right. It is not far from the junction and can be missed. Make sure you give yourself double the time on your return trip since it is all uphill on your return to the parking lot. Make sure to pass all the campground sites and park at the designated parking area for the trailhead(You will get a ticket if you park at the camping slots). There are also some waterfalls on your way up that I believe is better than Copper Canyon Falls. You can see use trails that lead to the creek that will lead to the other waterfalls.

The Canyon is much much cooler than the surrounding areas, probably due to the water.

The last mile hiking along highway 2 is rather mundane, but other than that, this is a great hike."", 'There are two trails and one dirt road at the trailhead. We made the mistake of heading to the upward bound trailhead and found ourselves on Winston peak!  It was a beautiful day and beautiful hike. Hope you enjoy it too.', 'Great moderate hike. LA was extremely hot and it was nice to be in the high elevation where it was 20 degrees cooler. Very few people on the trail and a lot of shade from beautiful redwoods and pines. There is still water in the river at the bottom of the trail but never saw the waterfall. Maybe next time. Would  do it differently next time and probably not do the loop to avoid walking on the highway for a mile at the end.', 'Beautiful hike with very few other hikers. Parked at Cloudburst Summit and decided to continue along the flat path instead of continuing on the PCT. There are two steep paths after you past the Burkhart Trail to get to the rope which leads to the bottom of the falls. Seems like the hot summer days has left just a trickle, but still a beautiful and peaceful area to relax. We tried to do the ""loop"" and continue back on Buckhart Trail to Angeles Crest Highway. Although Buckhart Trail is nice too, the walk back on the highway was seemingly dangerous and not as enjoyable if we had just walked back the PCT.', 'Beautiful and relatively easy hike near Mt. Waterman in the San Gabriels. Trail is shaded by the massive pines and cedars throughout the valley. Maybe it was because of the temperature (90+), but we saw almost no one else on the trail. At this time, the falls are just a trickle...but still a serene and pleasant reprieve.

You'll be walking down hill most of the way there so the way back is a little tougher. There's a few easy streams to cross and you're shaded through most of the hike. Waterfall is stupidly located in the opposite direction of the one sign you'll encounter. Signs says water fall to the left... Ignore it. Continue right on burkhart trail and it's literally a few paces away."", ""All 3 waterfalls were flowing and the water feels like it was in its 30's.   We ran into maybe a handful of people which was great considering how crowded places are getting in the weekend.  The views are great and the different water pools make this a great hike."", ""Per my Fitbit this hike was about 3.5 miles from the start of the trail. The camp ground was closed so we had to park on the street and walk down to the camp ground which was about 1.3 miles, so total about 6 miles. I was not expecting the extra 2 miles from the car and back. The trail is a little difficult to find if you never been there, but if you walk down to the entrance of the camp ground toward the back you'll start to see signs for the trail. You can also park at the exit which is closer to the trail. There are nice big rocks to eat at and enjoy the waterfall. Definitely, take a snack or lunch!"", 'Never made it to the falls. Beaitiful hike. Not a lot of people which made it very peaceful. There were several trails not sure which one was the loop I will have to download the maps so I can see direction to go.  I did 6 miles out and back but would love to know the loop so I could see the falls.', ""I was expecting cool weather, so I dressed in layers. The first 3rd or so was mostly unshaded around noon so it was pretty warm, even with only a base layer on top. However, once we got to the waterfall things cooled off considerably. You could probably get away with short sleeves if you keep moving, but we stopped for pictures.\n\nThere's still a lot of snow on the ground, particularly on the return leg toward Buckhorn campground. The trail got quite narrow and icy which added to the difficulty a bit. The creeks are flowing strong which makes for a spectacular waterfall, but also 2 potentially wet crossings. Be sure to bring waterproof high-tops. \n\nThe scenery was great: lots of redwoods, lots of ladybugs, and the constant sound of trickling water. Worthy of 5 stars once they can clean up all the fallen trees and the ice melts."", 'Really nice loop I made the whole loop.', ""Really hard hike in the snow.  I'm a healthy mid 30's who works out all the time.  Lots of snow on ground which made it amazing.  But really hard going up hill for more then half the hike.  Should have done clockwise rather then counter clockwise loop.  Scenery is fantastic. Highly recommend.  Wasn't able to find the waterfall.  Snow might have blocked it."", ""It's a great trail... although to get to the waterfall it can be tricky if it's your first time going. We didn't see no waterfall signage. If you take down the fire road you will come across some restrooms. Once you pass the restrooms about 2 miles in, the trail divides  but you have to be on the look out to take the trail that is on your right going downhill. You then are going to reach an area that requires you to cross the river stream ... you will then continue the trail about .2 miles to reach the waterfall area. To get down to the waterfall it can be challenging and dangerous.. you have to climb down some rocks. Someone did place a rope to facilitate going down and up. Hope this helps! Enjoy and be safe :)"", 'Loved this trail. Hiked in early January of this year. Waterfall was frozen over and the streams were too. So pretty. Make sure, if you go at this time, you have warm enough clothes. Also the ground can be icy at some points. Highly recommend.', 'It was a nice day to hike..we passed the falls coz theres not much signages to it.. Whoever left that rope is amazing!! Rapelling down and up the waterwalls just adds to the adventure', 'Since there are multiple trailhead options to get to these falls, my husband and I chose a 6 mile option. 3 in, 3 out. we parked at Cloudburst Summit off highway 2 and took trail down. it can get confusing so make sure you get a trail map at the visitors center off hwy 2 prior to reaching the summit.trail was beautiful with campgrounds along the way and restroom.  You will have to climb down a steep embankment to falls but just straddle the rope that is there up and down and you will be fine. Pretty decent elevation climb on way back from falls for apprx the whole way, (apprx 3 miles). Would not recommend this trailhead for beginners.  Moderate would be best. We had lunch at falls before starting back. If you want an easier hike, park at Buckhorn campground and take trail.  about 3 miles round trip and is rated as easy. That trail is Good  for kids as long as they can climb down to falls.', 'Trail was great, loved it. Views of the mountains are beautiful. To get to the waterfall was not clear from where we parked. My husband has a better review of this trail (Alan Mudge).', ""The trail was great, but the way to the waterfall is definitely not clear as other reviewers have stated. We parked off Angeles Crest SR 2, at Cloudburst Summit. We took the dirt road down to Cooper Canyon Campground. This is where it got confusing as to which way to go. There are no signs pointing to the waterfall. When you get here, go straight past the restroom, not to the right through the campground. You'll go on the trail marked for Burkhardt Campground. When you get to the fork in trail after crossing creek, look for the sign (someone wrote with a sharpie the way to waterfall), turn left and the waterfall is less than a quarter mile down. You'll need to take steep side trail down. Someone left a rope to help get down."", 'This is a beautiful trail, and a nice easy to moderate hike. That said, the side trail to the falls and pool is not clearly marked and is difficult to find. I turned too early and ended up at the top of the falls, which is very slippery and dangerous. If you end up at the top of the falls, TURN AROUND!! I wish someone would have told me that before I went. Other than that, this is a pleasant hike.', 'one of my favorite backpacking places. nice creek hike is super easy all down hill but on the way back very easy incline.', 'Did this as an out and back from cloudburst summit, mostly following PCT except we jumped onto the service road about halfway down, then resumed on PCT after the campground.\nYes, it\'s ""backwards"", the climb out was underestimated... But overall a super enjoyable hike. Did this in early Jan 2014. Super dry winter so far, so the falls were little more than a trickle but a very pleasant hike nonetheless. After the creek crossing, take a left at the fork and then look for a little side trail down to the falls. Very small snow patches on the part after the CG, a little icy. Saw 2 other couples all day. Whole hike took about 4 leisurely hours in total. Great hiking day in Angeles national forest.', 'An easy kid-friendly scenic 3 mile hike to Cooper Canyon Falls in the Angeles National Forest. (Date hiked: July 3, 2009.) Read the full write-up at: http://www.greeneadventures.com/2009/07/20/family-friendly-day-hike-to-cooper-canyon-falls/', ""Amazing hike!! It's summer so don't expect a huge fall, but for the pure adventure of going out and getting the hike done it is worth  it! Great ambiance, a lot of green, and surprisingly not that many other hikers on the trail. Took our dogs and they loved it, it's about a 2 hour hike with great scenery. Careful you might miss the fall. Once you wall past the sign that states cooper canyon trail one way and the other trail forward. Keep going and pass one steel retaining wall system and on the second go down and you'll find the pond and fall! Highly recommend! "", 'TIPS:  + Purchase an Adventure Pass either at the ranger station on the way to the trail or at your local Big 5/REI store: $5/day or $30/year.  + Parking is available after you pass the Buckhorn Campground entrance. A short dirt road will lead you to the Burkhart trailhead. + Arrive early. My friend and I parked around 10:30 am on a Friday. By the time we returned (1 pm), half of the lot was full.  + Follow the main trail. A sign is posted in the front and at the junction between Burkhart Trail 10W02 (forward) and Cooper Canyon Trail (to the left). DO NOT FOLLOW THE COOPER CANYON TRAIL/COOPER CANYON CAMP TO GET TO THE WATERFALL (lesson learned).  + Wear appropriate attire. Its easy to brush yourself against the greens or slide down the rocks.  + Bring lots of water and snacks! No trash can is available so be sure to dispose of your trash properly.  + Dogs on leashes are allowed on this trail.    NOTES:  + The trail is mainly switchbacks. Trekking there is downhill; hiking back is uphill.  + The pathway width is narrow to fit only one person. Be careful not to slip for the sides of the mountain are steep.  + Hiking towards the waterfall took a little over an hour with a couple of pit stops. My friend and I actually took the wrong route towards the Cooper Canyon Campground and didnt make it to the waterfall due to time constraints, but now we know for next time!+ From what Ive read, the waterfall appears to be mossy. So dont expect too much, but enjoy the serenity of the environment instead.     LESSONS:  + Read about your trail prior to attempting it. Youll definitely take in a lot more and appreciate it nonetheless. Read about other peoples experiences in order to learn from what theyve done.     [STATS] Summer-July. Late-AM. Sunny-60s. Very light.', ""Very nice hike. Did this with a buddy. We took two cars, parked one car at Eagle's Roost parking area and drove back down to Cloudburst parking area. First 2 miles or so was down the canyons with some shade but grand views of the mountains above. The waterfall was out of this world. It's like your sitting in Asian mountain, the waterfall was just a trickle but coming down through moss and rock. From the main trail, climb down the canyon to the waterfall pond. There is a rope to help you get to the bottom. Onward, we continued on Pacific Crest Trail, which is very rough because it's not well maintained and very narrow (maybe not many traverse that trail), easy to slip so be careful. The rest of the trail is straight forward, ascent all the way and climbing over a few fallen trees"", 'I hiked this trail 11/9 with about 6"" of snow on the majority of the trail. Went out-and-back via Buckhorn. Sign was posted at the entrance to Buckhorn Campground stating that the trails were closed due to weather. WHAT?!? The hike was beautiful and the air was crisp with pine. Water was running pretty low but the falls were spectacular! Icicles all around the waterfall along with patches of snow covering the the sides of the falls. Highly recommended for all! Just remember it\'s a decent enough elevation to make you pant a little heavier, so take it slow, and remember that its a ""upside-down"" hike either going out-and-back from Buckhorn or the loop from Eagle\'s Roost. \n\nPreviously completed on 3/18/2011 with much more snow (harder packed at least) and a much higher flow of water! This time I dropped a bike off at Eagle\'s Roost, chained it to the yellow gate, and parked the car at Buckhorn. Longer and more strenuous hike this way. But the 2mi. downhill ride to the car was worth it! ', 'Cooper Falls is Beautiful. I went there when the campground was closed so there was NObody there..lol There were a ton of trout in the pool at cooper.

Two options 1) Coming down hwy 49 from Auburn instead of turning right across bridge to the free spots - go straight. Pay parking (or use your annual Poppy pass) is on right side of road sort of on shoulder a little past the bridge - or continue a bit further and there is more spots by the bathrooms on left. 2) or you turn right across bridge and continue past the free parking on right and you will see a turn off road on your left to more pay parking.', ""Great challenge & nice and shady most of the way...would love to work up to looping around multiple times in one visit but I felt good just finishing the loop once. I never did see Folsom Lake as another reviewer said could be seen.

Tried a new park and took AllTrails app for a test run. End result: miles of trails covered w/ a smile and a cool trail map to boot. I always enjoy my hikes no matter where I go or what the trails bring, but this park is not an absolute repeat for me. If I lived in Sacramento, then yes, absolutely, I'd visit and trek it multiple times just cause it's close by and has ample trails and nice steep hills to keep the legs in check. However, not a destination I'd recommend for anyone further than an hour driving distance from this park. I find that this is more for the locals. Someone from the Bay Area or Central Valley where they have easy access to Mt. Tam, Muir Woods, Big Basin, and Yosemite to name a few of my favs for the same driving distance would be disappointed if they drove all the way out here. If you're looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of roads and freeways then this is not the place to go. Most of the trails are within ear distance of one of the nearby roads. Great park for crossing bridges, though! I enjoyed that and the steep-steep trail to get up to Foresthill Road Bridge. Steeper than Training Hill trail, though that was a fun grueling for the legs and lungs way to start off my hike on this day. If you're going to be in the Auburn area then I recommend you check out Hidden Falls park in place of this one. The trails are easier. Nothing steep. But the views of the creek are fantastic and you get to be in the rolling hills of the quiet countryside. Check out my review and pics. To sidetrack a bit: If you're a camping kinda person then I recommend checking out French Meadows past Georgetown. Super secluded. Great for those summer camping days by the lake. The kind without the motorboats relaxation. Go earlier as the reservoir does get super low by end of the summer season especially with the droughts we've been having in CA. Good fishing, though, I'm not a fan. I just really enjoyed spending the days chatting it up with friends and cooking gourmet camping meals then relaxing by the fireside at night. Of course, somehow every year we ended up with some crazy camp story like the year the breaks went out on the rental van."", ""Not the prettiest hike, you can see folsom lake at a small lookout when you get the the very top.

The fun part of this hike is making it up the hill. :)', 'Butt kicker on the way up!', 'Great workout and endurance hill. Starts at the river and has a steady incline for 1.5 miles. The trail is pretty well kept but it is definitely for the moderate to advanced hiker. The best part is the dip in the river on the decline. Great way to end the hike.', ""Great training hike or run.  I'd agree about the recent reviews about signage, but like others have said if you just take left hand turns after you get to the top you will do a 4 mile loop.  Shortly after you get to the top there is a small clearing to the west of the trail that opens up to great views down canyon and to Auburn.  Also, if you have a Golden Poppy pass (or don't mind paying the $10), a good place to park is the Quarry Road trailhead, and then cross 49 to a short spur trail to the loop."", 'Great challenging hike , but the signs need to be improved.', 'Great trail, very challenging first mile and beautiful last three. The trails are not very well marked, so be sure to grab a trail map, we ended up going 11 miles instead of 4.', ""I have a love/hate relationship with this trail. Ok, mostly hate lol. The name says it all. This is a training trail. No matter how many times you do it, it never gets any easier.\n\nDon't turn back when you get to the top.

There were probably some incredible views on this hike, but I didn’t see them because there was so much fog. I quite enjoyed the fog, though. It made for a very eerie and isolating experience. There was a short time where the fog broke and gave me a glimpse at Sausalito. It was breathtaking.I saw quail, hawks, ravens, and a ton of little chirpy birds. Some of their calls were really beautiful. There were also lizards, a group of bucks, at least 15 rabbits, and plenty of slugs.As far as difficulty, the main thing here is that it’s long! I was sweating a lot by the end, but there was never an incline that made me feel like my lungs were on fire.

You just have to assume because of the view and the path everyone else is taking.- At least half of the trail doesn't have shade- It is very crowded, but the longer version is less crowded. Even when I left today around 8pm, all the parking spots were still full. - Not enough parking.- Not well marked.

Good amount of uphill climbing with a lot of trail traffic.', 'Inspiration Point was fantastic! It was easy to find and just strenuous enough to feel proud of yourself once you get to the top. To top it all off, the view at the top will remind you how beautiful Santa Barbara really is.', ""A Santa Barbara classic. Relatively moderate distance and elevation gain with an absolutely epic payoff in the form of a 180 degree panoramic ocean view. You won't be disappointed."", ""I unexpectedly went to Santa Barbara today to run an errand and made time to hike this trail. I'm happy I did! I decided on hiking Tunnel trail that takes you to Inspiration Point. It intercepts with Jesusita Trail that you can also hike to the point, but it's 3-4 miles longer if you start this trail further down the canyon. I figured 4 miles would be fine for this hike. ;) I was lucky to snag a great parking spot, otherwise I can see why it would take an extra mile or so to just walk to the trailhead because parking is very limited. Tunnel trail starts out on a paved road, then turns into a wide dirt trail, and then for the final mile is a narrow rocky trail that leads you to Inspiration Point. I almost missed the turn off to the left that takes you to the top by the dried up creek. It's not clearly marked but just remember you need to get on the narrow trail that goes up. Even though Inspiration point isn't the top of the peak you still gain more than 1,300 in elevation. I loved this trail because it wasn't so long that you're exhausted, but you still get a great workout. It was really humid in Santa Barbara this evening so I got an even greater workout. I would recommend only doing this hike when it's cool. I was really warm going up and I started at 5:30 pm or so. However, annoying bugs seemed to follow me up the trail lol probably due to the humidity! I hiked this trail close to sunset and the views of the Pacific Ocean were beautiful. This happy and inspiring trail was a great way to look at Santa Barbara from up top and observe the beauty of the sea, mountains, and skies beneath me!"", ""Great morning hike! Short, but strenuous enough to give you a bit of a workout. It's better to go when it's cooler out because this hike does not have much cover."", ""Don't be fooled. This hike can be exhausting. Add another mile due to lack of parking. We had to park at least one half mile away. The uphill climb is a constant incline. I loved this joke because it was a work out. Be careful coming back. It is a fast decline. We saw one injury and could have easily injured ourselves two or three times due to speed. Bring water and bars. Our dogs literally quit on us. For those not in great shape take your time. I give this hike 4 stars because there is not enough ocean views. Definitely recommend for a workout."", 'Make sure to take plenty of water, but the view is definitely worth the hike.', 'Being from WA I was not used to the heat. I run trails all over WA. This hike was amazing but I got exhausted fast. I think I just needed extra water and to slow down. Out of towners definitely go just take your time and bring lots of water!', 'New here in the area and this trail is our standard now. Nice strong constant climbing but no real hand climbing with a wonderful payoff at the top! Really busy on the weekends and we suggest parking lower on tunnel road and getting the extra uphill warmup! If friends are in town, this is the spot for inspiration ;) ', 'Great hike!! Not too strenuous but not to simple. Definitely recommend this hike.', 'Nice workout, parking on tunnel rd might be difficult, you will be going up cement road first then you will reach the dirt path. There is a really rocky trail that goes up the mountain after the cross section, its a great view up there ', 'Very moderate hike, good well marked trail, pretty view of Santa Barbara and the ocean.', ""Was a good workout but not too strenuous. I hiked this on vacation with my cousin and her boyfriend. He proposed at the top. So it really isn't extremely difficult. Such a beautiful view from the top. "", 'Trail was rated strenuous but at least for this time of you it definitely was a moderate hike. Not to much to view on the way up however the view from the top is amazing. Parking is limited so you may have to walk a bit to get to the trailhead. ', ""I wouldn't classify this as extremely difficult, but it did wear us out. The view from the top is awesome. We went on a clear day and could see all the Channel Islands. Parking is difficult on weekends. "", ""This is an awesome workout. The trail itself isn't gorgeous but the view at the top is well worth it.

It’s the only one in the US still open to the public. Open Saturdays 12-4pm', 'This is by far the best trail I’ve had the opportunity to hike. The views are astonishing. Some parts were steep with lose rocks but overall this hike was easy. Not very crowded and very quiet. Will definitely be back several more times.', 'We are tied to hikes that allow dogs.  We are running out of places but happy to find this trail.  Coming from the East Bay in Walnut Creek it was very pleasant to have a sea breeze and a touch of fog.  Not the typical trail found in the east bay.  We loved it.  Only managed 3 miles but a nice get away from home.\nLots of birds, brown pelicans are abundant here.', 'Really enjoyed the first 2/3 of this trail... the steady ascent up the Miwok worked our lungs but didn’t overwhelm us, and the views as we picked up the Coastal were lovely (we were lucky enough to get a fog-free, sunny day). We were tired and cut over back to the parking spot along the Lagoon trail instead of going down to the point, will have to check that out next time.', 'The bottom part of this “hike” is a confusing mixture of parking lots and unmarked segments of “trail” some of which join up with each other, some of which just wander off and dead end. If you, like me, hike to get out in nature and away from people, don’t bother with the bottom third of the trail. Park near rodeo beach and go from there. If you’re looking for the scenic, tourist spots then that’s ok too and the bottom third of the hike will be perfect for you. Once you get out of the crowds, this trail is stunning, even on foggy days.', 'Just had a little time in the morning so we just did the coastal trail out to the lookout point and then back and up to the batteries. Very pretty, cool history with the batteries. Love the west coast shoreline.', 'Hiked clockwise from the parking lot across from the east side of Rodeo Lagoon.  Hiking time: 2 hr 34 min.', 'Great view of the ocean and great weather for hiking. This is more of a hard hike because of it he distance.', '', 'Beautiful scenery. This hike is relatively easy (some parts uphill), and goes through various landscapes, from coastal views to historical landmarks. Perfect time of the year to catch the blossoming flowers. Make sure to go to the lighthouse. Unfortunately for us, NPS only allows access to it on Sundays from 12:30pm to 3pm this time of the year.', 'One of my favorite hikes', 'Beautiful hike that includes histrionic elements along the Nike missile site and the gun battery.', 'Great trail , beautiful views , other trails you can take for more scenery , love the coast views', 'great bridge views, little crowded, very windy', 'Hiking my in the fog', 'Nice hike.  Early morning fog provides some drama to this hike.', 'This trail map should not include Point Bonita Trail. There\'s not a direct way to get from the Wolf Ridge-Lagoon Loop to Point Bonita without walking on the side of the road and through parking lots. Also, while the Miwok/Coastal/Lagoon trails are all dog-friendly, the Lighthouse Trail is definitely not. Just cut off the Lighthouse trail from this map and you\'ve got a perfect day hike loop. A lot of confused people go into the park looking for the ""Marin Headlands Loop trail"" but won\'t find that. Just look for the Miwok or Lagoon trails to get started.', 'Outstanding hike and views! Just a great day!', 'Excellent hike with two distinct and very different parts.  Park at visitor center per the trail map guidelines, then hike the loop clockwise.  First part of the hike is out to Pt. Bonita lighthouse and back and is very scenic.  Note that the Pt Bonita lighthouse is only open Sat- Mon starting at 12:30 and only stays open for a few hours.  Second part of the hike is moderately steep going up from Rodeo Beach almost to the top of Hill 88, then loops back down the Miwok Trail and back to the trailhead.  This second part of the hike is more typical of a Marin Headlands hike.  Hiking time: 2.5 hrs.', ""Gorgeous trail! I'd recommend going around the big hill counter clockwise first, so that you get to see the full ocean view right after climbing uphill -- a beautiful reward after a hot walk. There's basically no shade so be aware of that. Also, there's a portion of paved, sort of king pathway that you can't really walk around because of the dense shrubbery around it, so beware if you are bringing a dog. But I did see a lot of dogs around and they seemed to be doing ok. Just a thought!"", 'Going downhill the hast couple of miles on the miwok trail was great!', ""Great first 4 miles- beautiful views. Last 3 mile leg of this route is a little ridiculous. There really isn't a trail all the way through and you will be walking through a lot of parking lots. At one point you are walking through the YMCA property grounds and playgrounds just to stay on track- really bizarre ending to the hike."", 'Great trail with magnificent views.

I thought it would have super cool graffiti, as I am a big fan of street art, but this was just poor quality vandalism. I thought it was a slap in the face to see that people had tagged the trees, rocks, and the signs that could point you in the right direction/tell you about the history of the zoo.The old zoo itself was super dilapidated in a not cool way (can you say old ANIMAL PRISON). It also smelled terrible and I even saw a bottle of piss. Then there were these hoodlums blasting metal in the picnic area and hidden in pockets on the hills smoking weed and drinking beers, which they probably littered. I would probably come here if I was a goth kid in middle school trying to find a place outside my parents house to drink keystone ice and smoke cigs.

From there you can continue on the trail. We stopped taking this trail and head up to bee point. It looked more interesting then the rest of the old zoo trail. The old zoo itself is quite small and has been turned into a park. This hike would be a good hike for children. There is an actual park with grass for them to run around on. Also, they can explore some of the old exhibits. Bee point was pretty cool. Worth the trek up. The trail was a bit steep at points. Heading up to bee point, I would say is a moderate level hike for most casual hikers. It was overcast so the views were so so. But on a clear day, it would offer some excellent views of the valley. Happy trekking!', ""This is a nice leisure hike for beginners. It's about 2.5 miles with very little incline. It's a paved road.

amazing, the trails around it decent. There is a parking lot on Lake Road which is a five minute walk up a paved slope, so the falls are easily accessible, though there are a few stairs. We parked at the parking lot off of Clark Creek Road which gave us a ten minute hike through some of the surrounding forest before reaching the lake road parking lot and down to the base of the falls. The hiking around the surrounding area is decent- but you’re really here for the falls.

The park was beyond very busy and they had a line of cars out on 89 just to get in.

Don’t let the steep downhill walk discourage you from going to the bottom of the Falls. Beautiful views and breathtaking photo opportunities.

Several resting spots along the way for those who wish to rest. Great hike for the experience hiker or just someone wishing to view nature.', 'Gorgeous waterfall and an easy hike around the loop. Walk the creek and look for trout, watch people fishing at the falls, see the falls from below and above. Pay $8 entrance fee/car. Worth it to see the falls.

In my opinion much more awe inspiring and enjoyable then falls I had hiked farther to see in Hawaii!!!', ""Very easy trail, great for a day out with the family.  The trail's a little steep on the back side which means you'll probably be carrying the young 'uns for maybe 1/4 - 1/2 a mile, but still not bad at all.

I encountered no mosquitoes. was wearing vibrams and tank top to beat the September Sun. we were busy having conversation and lost our way going up, only to realize after a km that we were on the wrong path. markings are pretty distinct though. parking could be limited. 15 or so spots. parking pass for $5 can be picked up from the convenience store half a mile or so towards the north shore. don't park off the markings. we saw 3 vehicles getting ticketed for parking in front of the restrooms."", ""Although it's long, it's a fairly moderate hike. It is a steady climb with amazing views and ever-changing scenery. The top is a great place to capture some views and stop for lunch. Would highly recommend!"", 'My favorite hike in Big Bear so far!', ""Such a great hike!! Beautiful views the entire way up with the grand finale being incredible! Trekking up 1300ft then down again isn't easy on your body so wear good shoes, comfortable clothes and bring plenty of water! The summit (unlike most others) had plenty of sitting area! Happy Hiking!"", 'Had a great running hike, with beautiful views... and friendly people along the way!

Took me bout 2 hours round trip, but mostly because I stopped often to take photos. Great experience!', 'Great hike! Beautiful view from the top!', ""Well marked trail. Pretty much a moderate climb on the way up. It's about 7 miles round trip. Felt long on the way back! Beautiful view at the peak. Travels through an old burn area. I only saw a couple people on the way up, but several groups on the way back. Several well-behaved dogs. Everyone was very nice. I was hoping to see some eagles but no luck. Lots of little animals and birds. A coyote actually crossed the road on my way there. Parking area is a little small and requires adventure pass. Nice restroom in the lot. Overall a great hike! I believe it closes for the eagle nesting in Oct. so go now."", 'Low traffic on a Wednesday morning in mid September. Moderate rating due to elevation gain only.

Definitely an enjoyable hike!', 'Good trail to get away from the summer heat. Started at 6:30am was 54* ended at 9:30 it was 78*. Easy to Moderate trail.Would recommend this trail.

There was a drinking fountain at there also but it was not working. No water along they way', 'Was a nice afternoon hike!', 'Trail was great, left at 11am which made for a rather hot hike but not strenuous. Definitely recommend this hike.

We had a few groups of mt bikers coming down at the beginning of the trail, but everyone was polite, used good trail etiquette.  After about half way up, we only saw a few more hikers & bikers. Very serene. Warm day (80's) but intermittent sun/shade made it  comfortable enough.  Would definitely do this hike again.   P-lot was half empty when we returned. Also, remember to get the $5 Adventure Pass for your car (bought ours at Fawnskin Market)."", ""This was an enduring hike but we didn't give up and we made it all the way up!"", 'Great hike!

Good hike for my younger one who is starting to take longer hiking trips.  7-8 miles round trip - depending on which map/guide you read."", ""This was a fun hike and I was able to bring my pup with me. The first portion is intimidating because it is a steep switchback but once you get past that the trail isn't too bad of an incline. The views all around are great. I went in November so the weather was perfect and all the trees were just turning orange, red and all other shades. It was a great hike and eating lunch at the end was a great choice on the large boulders."", ""I did this 2 weeks ago when it was a heat wave in so Cal but it was very nice (75) on the trail with a slight breeze. This trail is the best. A great workout but can be difficult for dogs and kids. My phone battery ran out before I did so couldn't take a pic of a deer I saw. Lots of shade and great views.

Started at 8am and it was already getting warm. We had a 7 year old Chocolate  and an 11 year old Black Lab with us and they got sunburned even with sunscreen on. They also got dehydrated, exhausted from the sun and length. We had to keep stopping to cool the off in the shadey areas (thank goodness they were there.) They are good hikers and it was tough for them. And me. I only brought two waters and had no food. Bring lots of water, wear sunscreen, and start very early. The views are nice as would be expected, but the terrain is varied and great! Saw some lizards, blue jays, cotton tails. The hike is not hard but it is very long.', 'I did this hike yesterday. This was a great hike...I would definitely do it again. Great weather, and beautiful scenery!', 'This is a great hike. Took my experienced 7 year old son who is an avid backpacker and camper.

Went 4.95 miles before I got to the campground. A very nice hike on a chilly day, lunch at the campground then back the way I came. Seen 3 mountain bikers and a dog on the way down, other than that, I was alone. What a great day for a hike.', 'BEAUTIFUL hike! Very scenic the whole way to the top. I love Big Bear in the fall! That view from the peak is breathtaking and very serene. ', ' 3rd of 3 peaks in 3 days. This was the easiest and most scenic in my opinion. I have done this trail a few times to different locations with more trails to explore. Definitely will be out here again.', ' Great trail with some pretty nice views. After a mile turn right at the control road and the 2nd trailhead is on your left. I must have went about 2 miles before running into anyone. After that it got pretty busy. I made it to the peak where I made some tuna and cheese sandwiches with peaches on the side. Very nice day to have lunch on a peak.', ""We completed this trail on a Monday afternoon. Nice parking, Great views, good for the dogs, excellent work out and our only company was passing a guy on horseback. NOTE TO SELF: it gets really dark, really fast. We started heading back down from the peak a little before 1900 and that was too late. Good thing the kids left some juice in the flashlight or we'd been screwed. Pitch black by 1920. Our bulldogs turned into bloodhounds to help us back. A little scary but great feeling of accomplishment. Looses a star for a little lack of shade and sandy spots but otherwise a great hike for the novice. "", ""My wife and I completed this trail on Sep. 2 2012. It was an awesome trail with great views. Consider wearing proper footwear when hiking this trail as I almost twisted both of my ankles at seperate times on some of the rocks that you will be walking over. You can get a Forest Service pass at the Discovery Center in Fawnskin for $5 which is good for the day. Take plenty of water with you on this trail and use sunscreen as you will get burned due to the angle of the sun when on this hike. But don't let that deter you from a great hike with a great view of Big Bear Lake. "", 'Great Trail just completed this hike and the weather was not that hot, but it was hot enough to get a sun burn. Since this was my first time and I stared from Hannah flats campground the hike took me five hours.  Take plenty of water if you start from the campsite.  You will cross several marked roads and burned trees from  a fire. Overall th hike was fun and something new since I had never hiked in a high elevation it takes time to get used to the height.', ""We loved this hike today.  It's got the best views of the lake of the peaks I've climbed (Gold and Bertha).  Take 2-3 liters of water, especially if you are hiking in the summer months.  Much of this trail does not have shade.  But the view from the top is worth it!  We enjoyed climbing that extra off-trail 100 yards to the real summit.  We searched for the register box at the summit, but could not find it.  I hope that we just missed it and it hasn't been taken!\n\nThe trail was well-marked  and easy to follow on the way up, but make sure you pay attention to your turns at each intersection.

The trails are wide enough for 4 across easily with enough variation in ups/downs to be enjoyable. There are port-a-johns along the trail if you need to go. Also, well maintained with views of the lake from most vantage points. There is a concession stand with good beer also available which is nice after a hot hike or run. It's a nice park to hang out at with plenty of shade to lounge around in. One downside is that the parking is $10 per day unless you're a Poway resident, which then I believe that it's free. There are other areas outside the park to park your vehicle  to make it free, just check satellite imagery."", 'Nice easy trail to the kids on.', 'Is a nice trail we park at blue sky canyon trail we went to the dam half way lake poway we turn around and it was 4.8 miles Easy , nice views dogs enjoy it very muchGo early we started at 745 am and by 9 it was getting very hot', ""I love this trail I've been doing it for years, the views are great the trail is well maintained and it really works the ass muscles.

Loved it!', 'Always a nice walk, lake is super pretty.', 'Nice trail with the majority of it looking over the lake. We arrived around 10:30am, Parking lot was nearly full but we did not see THAT many other hikers, the trail was not congested at al, other than passing a hiker here or there, it was mainly just us around.

Great staging area for trailers, with horse water. If you live in Poway the entrance is free.

Iron Mountain is a more challenging run but you can't beat the scenery at Lake Poway..."", 'Nice!', 'This hike is literally as it shows. A 3mile loop around the lake, however do not let it fool you.

I quickly found out this was probably not the best time to go, it was 104 F degrees out there.  Even though I had a day pack with cooled gel resevoir the heat was just intense and it started affecting me towards the end of the hike.\n\nTIP: Bring lots of water!  And if you have plastic bottles, freeze them overnight.  If you have a reservoir pack fill it with ice in addition to water.  I think the micro-climate conditions around the lake are such that this place just gets HOT!\n\nOf course this was my first time, so I'll have to try again on another day.\n\nOther than the heat, this was a fun hike.  On the map it looks kinda flat, but the terrain is quite hilly. I started going right from the trailhead (going counter clockwise around the lake) and didn't expect that first long hill.  After you go down around the other side of the lake it is pretty much flat.\n\nThere's the trail to go to Mt. Woodson somewhere on the right.  That'll be for another day.  Once I got to the dam area I noticed you couldn't walk on it, and the trail takes you past it and you begin to descend on a series of switchbacks that take you down to the trail leading to the Blue Sky Ecological Reserve.  You walk right in front of the dam and then take a series of switchbacks back up and past the dam and back to park area.\n\nThere's a sign at the entrance booth that says parking is $5, but the booth was closed, so I'm assuming it's FREE during the week, and perhaps you pay during the weekends.\n\nAnyway, decent hike. I'm more partial to Lake Miramar because I've been going there for years, but it was nice to finally hike around Lake Poway for a change.\n\nWill be back again soon...\n\nRemember: Bring lots of iced water, a hat and sunscreen."", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '',

give this a 3.5 if I could. The view  and scenery were just okay and you followed a path that was close to the road, which I am never a fan of. If you’re looking for a workout, this hike is 5 stars. You start off hard and don’t stop as you move along from the poop out to the punk. Serious incline the whole way. Following the other trails down is highly recommended as I feel like it would be too steep to descend. The trail entrance to poop out is a little difficult to find, but is right at the corner of where you turn into the park and the main road.', 'We took the poop out trail up and mystic canyon down. The first mile is petty intense but doable.', 'It was a nice trail for a workout and enjoying the scenery. My backbone and waist wasn’t good condition. I felt pain even walking. However, hiking in this trail worked on me well. I’ve been there over one month, almost every day for treatment purpose. It’s enough steep for setting body pose. Anyway be healthy ~ and be happy everyone.', 'So, the reviews had me a bit worried when I first hiked this trail (12/11/18).  It is a reasonable hike and something that hikers with intermediate stamina can complete, albeit somewhat depending on which route one takes (intermediate or hard)..  The first mile is quite steep, and then levels off.  At about 1.5 miles, at the Punked Out trail sign, there is a junction--the right-side path goes straight to the top, or to where the map marks as the turnaround point of this trail (0.6 mile), and the path on the left goes to the same place (1.6 miles).  The shorter path, as you would guess, is a lot steeper.  So, take your pick and determine the difficulty of the trail.  Once on top, go another 0.2-0.3 miles and look for a not-so-easy-to-notice path on the left for a short climb to the true top.  Overall, this is an enjoyable hike, especially if you like to hike in green mountains with the snow-capped ones in the background.  As far as parking goes, the two possible start/stop points are about a half mile away--park on the Glendora Mountain Rd. to start where the map suggests, or park about 0.5 mile down the road on Big Dalton Canyon Rd. and start at the Mystic Canyon Trail.', ""Very fun and challenging hike. started around 6:00 am on black friday Mystic to Punk out to Poop out. Didn't see anyone until I was on my way down. I recommend trekking poles and hiking/trail running shoes. #optoutside"", 'Poop out Trail, got it’s name for a reason. The hiking incline is a hard one, I might say. It’s view is amazing once you reach the top. It’s a satisfying workout. I highly recommend you wearing hiking shoes.', ""pretty intimidating incline off the bat. google says to make a right. don't make a right and park on dirt on left.  there is a wood that says Dalton and Poop out. if u go to the tipy top u get a 360 view. kicks ur butt."", ""Starts off very steep then it's all downhill on the way back on Mystic trail. Poop out trail lives up to its name, as you will be pooped out. It will give you the workout you need for lower body and legs strength. It will also help develop endurance uphill. When you reach the top, it's all worth the amazing views."", 'very good exercise trail.', ""Poop Out to Punk Out and down to Mystic.  Wow.  This is my favorite hike to get a 2hr workout. You get 1500ft elevation gain in the first 1 1/2 miles so expect to get worked. Once you get to the top it's a long 3 1/4 miles trekking downhill. I'm thinking of starting at Mystic then to Punk Out and that will give me a longer time climbing up.  Check out Potato Mtn for a nice 4.2 mi 1100 elevation gain 80min workout."", ""The trail humorously lives up to its name. For all that work it's not as gorgeous as I'd hoped, but I was looking for more of a work out and didn't care too much about the vistas, which were still solid in the big scheme of things."", 'First .7 of a mile is steep steady incline. You’ll reach a flag once your there. The push to punk out is also steep and steady incline.  There is a  flat break between the two challenges... the hardest trek is the first 1.5-2 miles from then on is quite peaceful. great place to work on incline for more intense hikes like iron mountain by bridge to no where...

Yeah, it's slow goings at times, and not too exciting unless you turn around to enjoy the fruits of your labor. At about halfway up, it levels out a bit until the end. There's only one portion near the end that is downhill on the way up to the top. Once you get there, look around and smile at what you did. There are trails up there if you'd like to go further, and they're not as steep. Look at other reviews for more details. The way down isn't fun for your knees, quads, or calves. My arches screamed at me too with all the sliding. I'd say I worked more going down then up. Lots of sliding and slow-goings as you maneuver those steep declines with the lizards and bug-city around you.  Look around occasionally for the views though. On a clear day, you can see LA and maybe the ocean. My day was clear and the ocean wasn't easy to make out with my bad vision. I'd say the whole thing is a solid hour.

What’s unbearable and ruins the beauty of it is the MASSIVE amount of people here.

Bought a parking pass for $5 at the visitors center before heading to the mountain.  Although the person who checked us in at the gate to the parking area needlessly scratched our parking pass with plenty of free gravel parking.  He said it was already crowded at 10 am and we ended up being the only one at the top of the falls trail.  Jerk move if you ask me. Trail is pretty easy until you get further up the trail at the waterfall.  Rocks are very slippery and the trail is steep at the end.  Be careful and take your time navigating the final approach to the falls because it’s worth it.  Such a shame all of the graffiti someone left for everyone there, looks horrible.

And another baby snack in the stream heading up the falls. (not to sure what kind of snake it was tho.) I was prepared with our parking pass, $5. But noticed there was a graveled lot that said free parking. \nHiking up the riverbed to the various falls was a nice workout, not to strenuous but you can feel your muscles work as you find your balance on the slippery rocks. and yes they are very slippery, so becareful.! Great water flow, and it was very cold. But we loved it!', 'It was beautiful and so peaceful. It’s  a tiring walk since its all about balancing with all the rocks. Water is super cold.

Climbing those rocks can be a little steep but manageable for most people. There was quite a few bits and pieces of trash on this trail and at the falls. When I got to the top there was a group of young males smoking weed and leaving their trash behind. I guess easier hikes attract this type of crowd. Don’t forget your $5 adventure pass(got mine at local big 5). There was a free dirt parking lot behind the paved parking lot but I didn’t know if it would be okay to park there even though the toll booth was closed? Not sure, but better to be safe.', 'Beautiful', 'Great easy hike that can be challenging if you climb the river bed to the various falls.', 'Forest Falls was beautiful.

Ice and snow made the place even more majestical', ""This is one of the best waterfalls I have seen in Southern California. It almost doesn't qualify as a hike to me because it's so short and easy. The official trail ends at a viewing area for the waterfall, but the real fun is to continue on up each level of the stream creating the waterfalls. The main waterfall in the back is beautiful and there is often enough of a pool to partially immerse in (if you enjoy cold water). The only downfall, because it's so easy, is that it can get annoyingly crowded on weekends."", 'So much fun !! We loved this hike ! Our dogs loved it too . Playing in the pools near the water falls was their favorite', 'So much fun !! Our dogs loves it too ..', ""I like to go on weekdays. A lot less people than weekends and you have the falls all to yourself. My dogs love this hike. It's great on a hot summer day to cool off."", 'Beautiful in winter! Lots of rocks and ice to contend with. My dog ate it and fell down a segment of the waterfall which was sad, but he was ok.Really wonderful area. Parking lot was littered with trash.How someone could dump their garbage in a place like this is beyond me.', ""I've been to this waterfall twice and it is enjoyable. It's a peaceful spot, especially if you get there early. There are plenty of places along the creek to sit and enjoy listening to the water. It is an easy hike, even suitable for children. Do however wear sturdy shoes - preferably proper hiking boots – so that you don't turn an ankle. You will be crossing a dry riverbed (dry as long as it isn't raining or flash flooding anyway lol), which is a rocky environment. They prefer that you don't go past the observation point, but people do. There is nothing blocking you from doing it. I really recommend caution for a few reasons. The first is stupid people breaking glass bottles. If you are conscientious like I am, bring a trash bag and some heavy gloves and help with cleanup. Also be aware that the higher up you go, the more loose rock there is. There have been slides with resulting injuries and deaths. Do not push the limits of your capabilities and be aware not only of the environment but other hikers around you. Don't put yourself or anyone else at an unnecessary risk."", 'Took my 8 & 10 year old last weekend for a late afternoon hike. They loved the bouldering and shaded hiking and views of the several falls and pools along the way. It was typically crowded by the local hordes of families. Had to squeeze by as one family of 22 that created a major bottle neck, but most didnt hike up that far where sandals limited the climb. The goal was to reach the top and rest our feet in the very cold pools of water and relax to the sound of crashing water... mission accomplished!', ""Amazing falls, short hike but worth the drive..Took my oldest daughter with me ( not a hiker) and she ended up taken a bad fall, sprained her ankle, bruises and scrapes, but luckily no broken bones.I've been hiking for some time now, and my daughter's fall sure was an eye opener on how it doesn't matter how easy the hike may seem. Please beware, analyze your step, specially around loose rocks and water, which is what this hike is pretty much all about.Highly recommended but please pick up your trash and be careful with slippery rocks!Happy trails"", ""This trail is beautiful. if you reach the waterfall at the top, it is pretty breathtaking. However, the rocks at the top are extremely slippery! Be careful. To get to the falls you have to leave the designated path and climb over large rocks and tree branches. It's worth the view, but can be dangerous, so be careful!"", 'Trail to the base of the falls is relatively easy, although the footing is uneven in spots.  There are forest service warnings against climbing the unstable cliffs to the top. Saw one injured guy coming down and chose to stop midway up the creek below the falls. Still was a nice little escape. Pick up an adventure pass at the general store on your way through town.  With the low rainfall and snowfall this year, the falls are not very full and will likely be much lower this summer.', 'Nice hike, pretty easy hike to the first pool of water, if you go further, if becomes more difficult,  plenty of boulders and rocks to climb and is somewhat steep.  Once you make it to the big water fall, you have to climb a couple of boulders or walk in the water to get to it.  If you choose to climb the boulders, be careful, they are kind of slick and very much so if your shoes get wet.  Beautiful place, too bad taggers have vandalized the boulders.', ""went on this trail twice and enjoyed it very much. It's a short hike to the water but a very pretty one. You can get a great hike in if you go all the way to the top falls. be very careful as its steep and slippery.  clean and beautiful, love this place."", 'Nice trail and views once you get to the big falls. Still need to be careful though while on the rocks. Saw a gentleman take a tumble yesterday and need paramedics to come.', 'Nice little hike. Go on a weekday.', 'short hike amazing end but its more of climb than hike', 'The falls are beautiful and climbing around on the rocks is fun.  The actual trail is very short though. I would not go out of my way to visit, but if you are in the area, definitely check it out. The drive up can be a fun adventure in itself, as well. Check out El Mexicano nearby in Forest Falls for some good Mexican food.', ""The actual trail to the falls from the waterfall is very short, and very easy, but the actual falls are beautiful. Heading upward into the mountain is also fun but when we went it wasn't exactly a trail but a tried creek we walked up. Still such a fun adventure, and absolutely beautiful. Go on a weekday if you want to enjoy the falls. I've gone on a Wednesday and a Saturday and there were about three times more people on Saturday. Also be aware of wildlife, we saw a ram come down from the mountain and get very, very close to people."", 'I loved it!! Great time spent with family and friends!! Totally recommend!', 'Was short... But very beautiful. Word of advice do go on a weekday. Too many people there. And a dang family of 20 with a bunch of 5 year olds was chilling at top. Brought the dogs they did well including the tiny chihuahua. ', 'Great trail to go for a hike. The big water falls are awesome. Make sure to not take any kinds of good with you because there are alot of bears and wild animals in the area.', 'It was a great place, its true that it is more of a walk than a hike, but if you climb thru the rocks instead of the upward trail, it can be fun. Its totally worth it, the place is pretty awesome and worth going, the water feels amazing, especially on a hot day. Definitely recommend it, the only reason why it got Four Stars was because there were some beer bottles, more than I thought there would be, but if you can see past by it, its a pretty great place.', ""Agree with everyone else. This is a fairly easy hike. About .3 miles in and you see the falls. If you want to go to relax under some beautiful trees with the sound of falling water around you and small creeks, this is definitely the place for you. We took our kids, 6, 8, 17. The two younger ones would've had a tough time getting to the to water fall. Other than that it was amazing. Only reason I don't give a full 5 stars is because it was more of a short walk than a hike. It is very short, but definitely a must do."", ""so as most others have said.  this is more of walk than a hike. If that is to say you stop at the base of the falls. there are several tiers and you can continue to keep going and I was pleasantly surprised it was a decent hike. the better falls are the higher ones anyways. I'm sure I will go back.  your adventurer pass can be obtained just before you reach the parking lot at a little convince store on the right by a Mexican Restaurant..can't miss it $5 for the day."", ""Its a very short hike but still quite enjoyable.  There are a lot of rocks and you will sometimes have to climb up them to get back onto the trail, but there are many different routes to get to the same place.  Our group likes to climb so we may have not taken the easiest way.  However, you can't miss it, just follow the stream up and then sit back once you get to the waterfall.  Be careful, some of the rocks are really slippery."", ""Went today with my family including children ages 4, 6, 8, 10, and 14. It was very easy to find. The trailhead is at the end of Valley of the Falls Dr. off of hwy 38. Impossible to miss because you dead end into it. We were vacationing in Big Bear Lake so this trial was somewhat close to us. I wouldn't recommend making the drive unless you were already in the area because the trial is very small. We got to the base of the falls in a matter of minutes. However, there are many picnic areas and I think you can even camp there. There were a bunch of families picnicking in the base of the falls and along the stream as well. A California Adventure Pass is required and they can be bought at a cool little shop about 1 mile from the trailhead. The hike was incredibly short, but the waterfall is awesome! At first I thought the water wasn't going to be flowing well because the stream in Mill Creek Wash was very small, but the falls itself was pumping pretty darn well. Once we got to the railing we just walked around it and hiked upstream. We all had water shoes on and this made it very easy to navigate upstream. There were a bunch of smaller tiers, each one as cool as the last. You can hike far enough to get to a very big waterfall, but there is a little bit of a climb up the side of the hill. All of the kids made it up the scramble except for the four year old, but that's only because she simply didn't want to try it (any child can make it to the top with the help of an adult). There was some broken glass from broken beer bottles that seemed to have been tossed by the same people that spread graffiti on some of the rocks, but this was well taken care of. I wish I could have said the same about the glass. If you come here PLEASE pack up your trash and try to pick up some other litter too."", 'even though this was a fairly short hike, it is a great hike. it challenges in a couple different ways due to the climbing and leaping that you end up doing... There are several options to take to get to the falls... yet they all lead the same way... The fall itself is awesomeand tall... we went early in the morning so my friends actually got cold by the fall itself.... we took the climbing / walking route the way in...  You have to cross the stream many times so its challenging on the slippery rocks.... We took the trail back and that had some cool little surprises too.... Reall a great hike.... Then go check out Therman flats down the way back.... Cool little hike easy to get to the stream yet intersting views along the way..\n', ""Great hike. Lots of rock. Hard to find if you don't know where your going. Beautiful waterfall. Best if you go early. "", ""First time at Big Falls in Forest Falls. I was amazed at the beauty of the stream and the water. It's a very short hike from the parking lot to the streams at the base of the falls, but the climb up to the waterfall is difficult and a little dangerous for the new hiker. Rocks can be very slippery. Use extreme caution. Upon reaching the waterfall, it's beautiful. Very cold at 8 in the morning. Loved the climbing part. "", ""Very easy hike. From the parking lot, head towards the creek (very little water at this time), cross and head up where the sign is. Once you reach the black bars, you can enjoy the waterfall and the stream below. I didn't try it (although I wanted to and should of and I didn't know), but if you go down besides the black bars (carefully), you can scramble to a pool at one of the base of the waterfall. Overall, I enjoyed being out there."", 'A lot of snow,every time I see the falls they look different ', ""Very Nice Place. Enjoyed the easy hike to see the falls. The only thing is the directions said to go to Island rd but don't keep going all the way on Valley of The Falls and will take you to the Trailhead Picnic Parking Area. Be prepared lots of bugs but this place is awesome!!!"", ""Lots of bugs is an understatement! But this area is so gorgeous, it's worth it.  I was a little confused about the area, the directions say to make a left onto Island Dr., but that's a private, unpaved driveway. I just kept going straight and parked at the picnic area. There was a lot of signage for a trailhead, so I went with that. It wasn't crowded this morning at all, so I plan on going on Friday mornings whenever I can!  The weather was perfect today, it was about 73 degrees and a little cloudy. "", 'There was millions of lady bugs swarming around where we parked. It was such an insane event and took some careful planning to even get out our car, but it was impressive. Other than that, this was such an easy hike/scramble for such a stunning fall. Top fall is amazing and the wading pools beneath it were refreshing! Water was freezing when we went, but we still splashed around for a little. Swam around in the wading pool about halfway down before going back down to the bottom fall/creek and ate lunch. Lots of bugs down towards the bottom and poison oak in some areas on the way up so wear bug spray and keep your eyes open :)', 'Short hike beautiful view of the falls. Hope to return soon without the kids so we can hike up higher :)', ""Father's Day morning hike with my husband; a beautiful short hike to a picturesque scene of a natural waterfall with the San Bernardino Mountains as a back drop. A great beginners hike to see a natural beauty in the IE. Key note; the trail is dog friendly as we saw many people with dogs on trail. We wished we would have brought out Cocker Spaniel! "", ""I've been visiting that place since I was a kid. Recently went up and could not help getting upset with all the painted rocks covering years of vandalism. The place is beautiful, but too accessible to all types of visitors. Still worth the short hike to take in what's left."", 'This is the tallest waterfall in Southern California!! The hike is easy some climbs to get to the base of the lower falls. You can see the height of the falls on the road in.', 'I lived in Forest Falls, near Big Falls, for nearly 4 years and loved it.  This is an easy hike, but you must be aware that the rocks do slide and many children get seriously injured climbing near the falls. You have to have very good hiking shoes or boots to avoid slipping on rocks. The creek is sometimes fierce and must be forded;  many times I have waded across in bare feet. It seems like every time I read about Big Falls a child has been injured or killed here.  Use caution if you bring children along.', 'Fantastic place to go see as a detour on a trip... had a great time.', ""Short hike to view beautiful falls. Most rate this easy, but I found the short climb pretty steep and challenging. \nThere is a lot more hiking to be done in the area, so if you're a hearty hiker you won't be disappointed. (See Vivian Creek Trail.)"", ""This isn't really a hike, more of a short walk from the parking lot.  There are usually crowds on the weekend.

park when you get to the locked gate and then either walk on the road or take a loop trail around Wright’s Lake to find the start of the trail.  It’s really beautiful this time of year, and not very busy.  The trail is hard to follow at times, but you can keep your bearings by the prominent peaks and rock formations, plus the cairns, as you hike.  Highly recommend!', 'What a hidden gem! This hike was a gorgeous trek through Desolation Wilderness across huge slabs of sparkling granite. At this time of year, the lakes were frozen, but so clear you could see through to the bottom. The views were spectacular even though it was a bit smoky due to a wildfire elsewhere in California. The trail can be difficult to keep track of, especially in the open granite areas. Keep an eye out for cairns to mark the way. While it wasn’t too strenuous, there was some loose talus and shale, making me wish I had my trekking poles on the way down. It is clear that this area is popular in the peak season, so we were happy to have the trail almost entirely to ourselves!', 'Great hike.  My 5 yr old was able to do it all by himself no problem.', ""Nice mix of terrain but not much shade and can get hot, lakes and creek are nice place to cool off.  On my trip to Island Lake we didn't see a lot of places to easily relax by the lake but we didn't explore all around the lake either.  As others have stated, picking up the trail on the granite sections may be more difficult for newer hikers."", 'Fantastic hike. I recommend for experienced hikers only.', 'This was a really beautiful hike but I thought the trail could have been market better. We somehow veered left somewhere on the tail and ended up very lost and had to climb up a lot of rocks to get back to the trail. If you don’t get lost, this trail is great and the lake at the top is very refreshing on a warm day!', ""I went back to hike this trail the second time this summer and there are more wildflowers past Twin Lakes due to snow melt. The small ponds/giant puddles are fully evaporated by now, making is easier to hike. The path up to Island Lakes is difficult to find, but once you see the trail, it's all good from there!"", 'Backpacked to Island Lake  July 6-8 and loved it. The area is super beautiful and is only a 3-4 mile hike from the trailhead.  One day we did a day hike up to Mount Price and get a look at Lake Aloha.  Overall a great place for a low mileage backpacking trip!  Here is my full report with pics: https://backpackersreview.wordpress.com/trip-reports/desolation-wilderness-twin-lakes/', ""Backpacked in on the 3rd and out on the 5th.  Wrights Lake Road is now open again for access, so you don't need to go through Ice House Road.  it's a much shorter drive to and from US50 from Wrights Lake Road to the trailhead.  The trail is pretty clearly marked, and parts where it wasn't, we went ahead and rebuilt some of the cairns that had appeared to have fallen apart.  When you get closer to the lake, there are 2 paths that will take you on either side of the lake.  Do not attempt to go around the lake, since there are unstable boulders and no clearly defined path.  Instead, go back to the area near the shallow water fall just below the lake, and go in either direction, you should be able to find the trails easily from this point.  I brought my ultralight fishing gear and caught a lot of brook trout.  Luckily the fishing was good because we had left a few packs of food at home so we were a bit short.  There wasn't much in the way of wildlife up there, but we saw some marmots and chipmunks.  The wind up there was pretty bad over the few days, but otherwise it was a beautiful, relaxing time at this less populated lake in Desolation Wilderness."", ""Beware the trail as pictured past Twin Lakes dissolves into a rocky hard scramble and unsafe water crossing trying to get back to Twin Lakes. I wouldn't recommend it for others to follow."", 'This trail was absolutely beautiful last Sunday! The granite slabs were well-marked with rock piles to follow until the trail started again on the other side, and if you stray off on accident you can just look for the closest cairn or line of rocks. Bring lots of water and sunscreen as much of the trail is exposed — better yet, bring a water filter and drink from the fresh waterfalls! As of last Sunday, Wrights Lake Road was open from Highway 50 to the overflow parking lot by the camping area, so there’s an additional 3/4 mile hike from there to the trailhead. The parks crew at the trailhead said the road set to be fully open by this weekend.', 'Wrights Lake is where this is located. Twin Lakes are very small but nice. Wrights Lake Rd is closed from hwy 50 and has been for a few years now and CalTrans has done nothing to fix it. In order to get there you need to take Ice House Lake Rd off of Hwy 50. Follow it until you see the turn off to the right for Ice House Lake which is 1 mile in from main rd. There is a fork in the road. Go left and follow the signs for Wrights Lake. Approx 10 miles. Make a left onto Wrights Lake rd and go about 2 to 4 miles to Wrights Lake. You can walk around either side of the lake to find Twin Lakes. If you want an awesome hike..go up Rock Bound Pass to PCT..Thats a great hike and can be done in 1 day if in great shape. If not so much take basic overnight gear and camp up there for 1 to 3 days. Sign in at the rangers station there so they know that you are out there in the event of an emergency in the area.', ""The Wright's lake recreation area was still closed so we parked in parking area just outside of gate. made our hike about 1 mile longer but it was a flat easy mile. once you hit the trail head its up hill pretty much the whole way. mostly sunny hiking with some shady spots. 2 small creek crossings. Some areas the trail is easy to follow. other areas you have to stop and look for cairns or follow. Not to difficult to keep on trail if you are observent. Strenuous hike but well worth it especially when you get to twin lakes. Amazing views at the lakes."", 'Beautiful trail! Amazing views everywhere! I was pretty the only hiker on the trail on the way up until I ran into some backpackers. Perfect trail to enjoy some solitude. There are not many signs, but I just followed the stacked rocks and found the trail fine. Also, the trail is pretty much snow-free, but the road to the main parking lot is still closed so I ended up hiked a mile from overflow parking lot to the trail head.', 'Absolutely beautiful hike. Lots of waterfalls on the way up to the lakes and not too many hikers in the late spring. Parts of the trail are not well marked, which can get confusing at times. Fortunately, the trail follows a river most of the way, so it’s hard to get too lost. The views of the peaks and lakes at the end of the trail are well worth the trip!', 'Went a week ago and reached Island Lake wearing hiking boots. Snow coverage made navigation difficult especially as it became darker, so bring a GPS to re-trace your steps. I recommend wearing microspikes and gaiters as the trail was covered with compacted snow in many areas. Use the natural landscape such as creeks, melting snow and treeline for navigation. Dirt road to Twin Lakes had a couple hills with deep snow patches so bring chains just in case. The view of the mountains from Island Lake was incredible!', 'Went September 2017. Easy hike to the lakes. Even if you get off trail there’s tons of cairns to always help out. Got hailed on but it quickly dried up!Too windy to fly fish. Lots of off trail explorations with easy exposed granite as access.Mosquitoes not a problem due to constant low mph wind.', 'This hike is the one I have enjoyed the most, the hike encompasses all kinds of terrain. It was too windy when I reached the lake and could barely stay for 15 mins by the water. The trail is not well marked and uses cairn as trail marker, As the 2nd half of the trail is through rocky terrain and has scattered stones, it is very easy to miss  the cairn especially while  on the return and possible to get lost. It is advisable to have the compass and Map and rely on that for this hike. \nAll said and done, The hike is more pleasurable for a moderate hiker than the scenery around the lake. One must hike this trail at least once.', ""Awesome hike. Can't wait to do it again. Day trip today but would like to overnight next time."", 'Twin Lakes is absolutely stunning. I backpacked there from Grouse and stayed one night - it gets VERY windy at night and I was not expecting that. Other than that, beautiful lakes with amazing rock formations and mountains surrounding. Fun boulders to climb over and take pictures on. The trail at times is difficult to follow so you have to pay close attention. Previous hikers have formed a path out of rocks, so look out for the rocks and follow them to the lakes.', ""I went 10/1/2017.  We started the hike at 10 am on a Sunday and hardly anyone was on the trail, mostly a few backpackers. it's gorgeous. Not overwhelming at all, great for a semi challenging mellow hike. I can't wait to introduce it to more friends."", ""vast expanses of granite, beautiful river, dramatic peaks, clear lakes, lush vegetation, nothing not to love. definitely go all the way to island lake. the trail is hard to find but you don't really need it. just back track a bit from twin lakes and cross the river to get on the left side of it and head to the back of the basin. also I should mention that I got stuck in a thunder storm which was not at all fun. take the forecast seriously!"", 'This trail was absolutely wonderful!  It started out a little steep but leveled out after the first mile or so.  Ran into a few people on the way up to twin lakes.  Ate lunch at the lake and took a swim in the FREEZING water!  On the way back down we stopped at a waterfall on the side of the trail where we swam in the warmer water. ABSOLUTELY STUNNING!!!!', ""Parked at Rockbound parking area headed up to twin lakes.  The walk to the lake is mostly up hill and as you get into the Desolation Wilderness the path became a little harder to follow.  Just getting back into backpacking and I am not in the best shape so you can take this with a grain of salt.  I found the hike to be rather difficult.  Worth it, but difficult.\n\nVery pretty with some awesome few's looking back toward Wrights Lake. Several spots with water, rivers, and waterfalls.  The sound of water is all around and several birds and lizards.  The trail was fairly busy with many folks bringing dogs.  Snow was still to be seen around the lakes."", '', 'Tough climb with a heavy pack but well worth the effort. Me and my wife chose this hike for our first backpack trip. The views were unbelievable, only two other campsites were in this zone of desolation wilderness, and the lakes were warm enough to swim in. Many wild flowers and streams flowing in between the lakes. Boomerang lake is deep enough for 10 ft cliff jumping, twin lakes has a beautiful waterfall flowing into it, and island lakes is a paradise. There is no good way to reach the rest of desolation from this zone. Plan to hike back out of this area in order to reach more terrain in desolation wilderness.', 'One of the most inspiring hikes . Breath taking beauty . flowers, str-eams. lakes  vistas Incline is what Iwould Call moderate plus! But worth it . Patches of snow at twin lakes  places the trail up was confusing and unclear we lost it 3 times, but after side bunny paths we would reconnect again . she way back was more Clear because you could see down fartheR and see the path . Going up there are many possible . forks &  not clear indicators in a few places. Ighess we missed . everyone: But we made it! on the way back CloudsCame in & thunder rolled which added to the whole experience . Will definitely do again.', 'Spent one night there with my 12yr old daughter and some fiends. Great spot to fish, swim, explore, and enjoy the scenery.', 'Just got back from an amazing time at twin lakes/island lakes. We camped in a little spot nestled between island lake and twin lakes. The wildflowers are blooming, there are still some waterfalls running and the temperature was perfect in day or night. We took are dog and am so glad we brought his hiking booties. There is a lot of loose rock/granite and his paws would have been torn up. No snow left directly on the trail, but there is some off the trail. Had a great time. Got the overnight permit the morning of without issue (got to the ranger station at 7am).', 'We went 7/29/17 - trails are great! clear and free of snow. Tiny creek crossings with rocks, easy enough to keep dry feet. Couple small patches of snow at the top (not sure how considering it was 70+ degrees out!) Nighttime was gorgeous! Was able to sleep without the rain fly and see the bazillions of stars. Low was 55 degrees in middle of night, perfect!Oh and the gates at Wrights lake are now open so parking at the TH was easy. Although heads up it was completely full by 9am Saturday morning. Mix of backpackers, day hikers, and people just enjoying Wrights lake, kayaks etc', 'Left Thursday and climbed to Twin Lakes. One slightly dicey  creek crossing but made it over with dry feet. Stunning every step. Saw only one person - a boy with great abs, a fishing pole, and a slightly loose speedo. Went back to TH next day to pick up bro and went cross country to the Enchanted Pools. Followed the rushing creek up and cross country back to camp. Friday night only saw one duo and the two rangers who religiously check permits. It was hot!  Next trip I want to go to Umpa Lake and down the far side if the Pools.', 'What a great hike. We have lots of water this year which makes the trail just stunning. Im a bit older so the going up took me a bit longer than the coming out. Stopped along the trail to look at the beautiful running river. A few places where the water was on the trail but nothing you cant get around with dry shoes. Once you reach Twin lakes...its breath taking! Great hike... we went on a Sunday and pasted probably a dozen group of hikers coming in. See photos above', 'So I went to Grouse lake first 7/11/17 and then to Twin Lakes and back. My Garmin registered the total of 7 miles. Trail is really well marked. You will have to cross a few streams and one big patch of snow to get to the lake. To access Island lake and Boomerang lake you will need to cross some runoff streams.', 'There is still a substantial amount of snow once you reach the tail end of the hike. It is an amazing time to take the trail. It is well marked throughout; however, portions are still currently snowed over, but it is easily discernible to stay on route by following the footsteps through the snow.', ""hiked 7/2/2017This was an amazing hike that wasn't too long of a distance to see some amazing views of alpine lakes. Currently there's still a ton of snow and snow melt so expect many creek crossings and to get  your shoes soaked. It's easy to get a little lost in a few places, but there are a bunch of self made rock trail markers or lines of rocks to follow. It ended upmuch easier to find our way back down after we had already made it up. If the day is hot enough, bring a swim suit too! We saw a few people jump into the twin lakes (and run out right after) but it's a quick way to cool off!"", 'Gate at Wrights lake is closed so parking at lower lot added a mile or so. but the route was not to bad to follow considering all the snow. Lower Twin Lake is mostly free of ice but upper Twin Lake and Island lake is still frozen. there were plenty of foot prints to follow. Shin to knee depth ford to get across the outlet to lower Twin, in order to head up to Island. very cold water!. he marmots are out and about. Really beautiful and rewarding hike', ""We went yesterday, June 24th.  We had to park in the lower parking lot as the recreation area that takes you to the trailhead was still closed. That added about 3 miles round trip.The trail wasn't very well marked after you get out of the forest and into the heavy granite area.  Missed it several times.  Was a decent hike that I would call moderate thanks to the extra mileage we added.  Physically, we are 40+years old and we're athletes 15 years ago.  We are still active but by no means athletes... (so many reviews that talk of difficulty level, you have no idea of the condition of the hiker)Scenery was nice.  Not much wildlife.  Still a bunch of snow on the ground. Enough to have a snowball fight with our son and build a 3' snowman. Would not want to do it in another month."", ""TRAIL IS CLOSEDI've been on this trail before and LOVED it so I went back and it's currently closed. Due to the nasty winter, the road up and the trail are blocked by snow-- really wish AllTrails had told me before I drove 2 hours up there."", ""Easy for the first mile, then a moderate climb with a nicely marked trail..keep an eye out for stacked/lined rocks to guide you up. No shade for lunch really, but island lake was a gorgeous destination spot.  Lots of people had their dogs, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it-would be hard on their paw pads (maybe my dog is just a pansy "", ""A few tips, limited parking on weekends but overflow parking available one mile away.  The trek to twin lakes is a consistent, yet bearable climb. The first mile is forest but the last two miles you're on either solid rock (well marked) or cobble. I rate this hike as a solid moderate rather than easy moderate. Once you get to the first twin lake which is amazing, have a snack but then head out towards the second lake...my guess is to get there it's about another mile.  Catching the trail to the second lake was a bit tricky. To find it, simply stay left (but close) to the first lake and you can't miss it. As you head towards the second lake, don't be fooled when the path takes you to a little beautiful lake on the path called boomerang lake - keep going and the second island lake is another quarter mile or so up a little hill. Wow!"", 'The lakes ', 'Amazing and Beautiful! Parking is very limited. Which means a limited number of people on the trail. Get there early. Could be a tough on a hot day. Lots of exposed granite.', 'excellent half day hike where any levels and age can enjoy', 'Did this hike last year and discovered how out of shape I was. Joined a gym, and this year it was a nice walk. As outhers have said the views are just great and the waterfalls and lakes are beautiful.', ""One of the most beautiful hikes I've ever done. Several lakes along the way and the sweeping mountain vistas are so amazing. Love love love this hike."", 'Love this trail and lakes are absolutely beautiful. Will definitely backpack here again.', ""This is a great trail and the lakes are beautiful! Can be a bit crowded this time of year but still worth it. If you bring your dog know that there will be lots of other pups running around, but I've never had a problem with aggressive dogs here. Pay attention when going across the open granite as it is easy to lose sit if the trail. This ap helps a lot but also keep your eyes open for cairns to guide the way."", ""One our the best hikes this season! The Desolation Wilderness is like an adventure park. You have lakes, massive granite rocks, creek crossing, cascading waterfalls, you'll get lost and find your way back, semi constant fear of a thunderstorm, bears(if you're staying overnight), and snow! \n\nQuick Tips:\n- Bring trekking poles\n- Get Permit\n- Bring water, insect repellant, swim wear (if you'd like to take a dip in the cold lake)\n- GPS or Compass is must\n- Check weather before your hike"", 'Great day hike, something for every hiker. Our youngest in the group was 4yrs old and he made it out and back only being held to tip toe across a brook or two. Was an unseasonably cool day with cloud cover and a breeze.  Early evening gave way to sun and little to no wind.', 'Very peaceful. Near twin the wind was a tad relentless.  Found shelter had a killer private view during lunch.The water will refresh any penguin!pay attention- know how to use your compass/map,getting lost is fun', 'I went cross country from Twin Lakes to find Umpa Lake, a marshy large pond, officially a small lake, then to Enchanted Pools, backpacking.  I camped near the pools then out the next day.  Gorgeous.  Umpa was exposed and windy, and Twin Lakes was too.  Enchanted pools is more protected, and had an amazing sunset. My GPS tracks were loaded on http://www.everytrail.com/view_trip.php?trip_id=1785853    A map is on my blog page linked below.', ""Still a bunch of snow once you get out past the Permit sign a mile or so in. Wrights Rd has finally been plowed, but the campgrounds says it's closed for the season. Wouldn't say the trail is too hard to navigate, until you get to the snow. At that point you will be required to make your own path to the lakes. Still a solid hike and super nice above the tree line."", 'Slow', 'Great trail! Some woods a lot of rock faces and ""steps"", good place for treking poles at least fot us oldies. Parking at trail head is some what limited so get there early and not on a weekend.', 'Great hike! Took the whole family. Got there at 8 and still had to park in the overflow. Hiked from twin lakes to boomerang for lunch. Caught frogs and a snake. My parents and 9 year old jumped off the 20 ft cliff while my 4 year old waded in on the other side. Great for day trip or camping. Had to carry the little one about 2 miles of the total trip, but she had a blast. Hope to go again by the end of summer.', 'Nice day hike to Twin Lakes.  Stopped at what I think is the ""enchanted pools/falls"" area about 2/3 of the way up on the right (not marked).  Park at the trail head lot before 10AM or walk the extra mile from the overflow lot.', 'Rockbound lives up to its name. Rocks are ubiquitous along the trail, you will have to get used to rarely having flat-footing and always watching your step. This might be the rockiest trail I\'ve hiked (not sure if I\'m exaggerating here but that\'s how I feel in retrospect) - but hey, if you are into geology you will rock out. If you are a newbie this might be an unpleasant factor. \n\nAlso don\'t expect too much shade - there are several vast ""granite plains"" with scarce trees that you will traverse, and of course not many shady areas can be found as you gain elevation, although there are a few big trees up there perfect for taking a break. The views are great. Plenty of interesting flowers abound. And the bird\'s eye view of Doris Lake is your reward upon reaching the some-8500 foot Rockbound pass. This hike is generally regarded as moderate, which I agree with. It\'s a cinch for the first several miles, with an abrupt but not-so-bad elevation gain near the end.\n\nOne more thing: Most hikers know that June is mosquito spawn season. I approached Doris Lake and saw thousands of them swarming the shoreline. They came after me (despite my bug spray layer) and I had to stay away from there, losing out on a peaceful resting spot. I felt like Indiana Jones running away from those thirsty insects...', ""Great overnight backpacking trip up to Island Lake this weekend. Nice hike up to Twin Lakes, and continued up to Island Lake. Not as many campsites as I was expected but came across a gem at Island Lake. Took a hike around the east shore of the lake and continued down to Twin Lakes. Made a BIG MISTAKE by trying to hike along the East shore of upper twin lake. Lots of giant granite boulders made tough work for us, especially with our dog(who luckily had a harness pack). Had to cross another large granite boulder which ultimately meant I had to go into the lake to move our crew along. Finally made it back to the trail at lower Twin Lake which was a sight for sore eyes. Overall a great hike with lots of snow and water early in the season. Not sure when in the season the Wrights Lake recreation area opens but this will cut off a mile of the hike, unless we completely missed something and this wasn't necessary."", ""Great hike to go on a nice day, unfortunately it poured on the way back, but I loved it. Awesome views of the lakes and a nice big waterfall I didn't know was up there.  Keep an eye out for stacked rocks as it is very easy to lose the trail at times, the rest is well marked.  It's only due to the time of year I am sure, but I was hiking up a small stream almost the entire time so bring good boots as it can be slippery.  Once the rain hit on the way back it was like hiking in a creek; good times. Well worth the trip and getting soaked. The last thing to know is you will need to pick up a permit to hike this trail in the normal summer months."", 'one of our favorite areas to hike! lot of granite to hop on, climbing, lakes, views.', ""Free parking is always good!  The trail was well marked and beautiful.   Not too steep or too long, be sure to check out Island lake just .5 beyond twin lakes,  past boomerang lake.  Take a lunch and spend the day swimming at lower twin Lake (the best swimming hole in my opinion).  There's no place to buy lunch nearby,  don't bother with the general Store or restaurants in Kyburz or Strawberry (we tried, no good).  There are several trails in the area around wrights lake, we will definately be back.  P.s. get specific trail maps from the rangers or info station."", 'Great hike. I followed the signs for Twin Lakes, passed Island Lake, and made it all the way up to the saddle to the north (left) of Mt. Price. (I believe around 9750 ft). Took me 6 hours to go 10 miles, including the no-trail hike up and back down the mountain face. This is my second time, both have been in August. 2013 had more snow and the lakes were more full and beautiful, but nothing comes close to seeing everything for miles. Union Valley Resevior is easily seen.', 'Great hike.  I backpacked in with my 5-year old son for his first trip.  As far as that goes, this hike was perfect.  Definitely pushed his limits with the steady 1000 foot elevation climb, but it was well worth the effort.  I could see this being a great day trip as well.  Note that more than half the hike is over granite and without shade.\n\nLakes are gorgeous and clear, reasonably warm (in late July).  If you do backpack in, note that there are not many tall trees for hanging food, so you have to get a bit creative.  Only a few shaded areas that would work for camping (at least as far as I saw).', 'Wonderful hike. Went for an unplanned swim in the lake - so deep and clear. Only 10 ft out and it was 15 - 20 ft deep at least. Saw some backpackers headed in carrying firewood. No campfires in Desolation people, read your permits. Great little day hike. Pack a lunch to enjoy at the lake and go for swim!', ""It's July 2014. Still plenty of water flowing and in the lakes and flowers blooming everywhere. Absolutely beautiful time to be here. Not a hard hike and there is plenty to see and do. Swim in Twin Lakes, get there early enough to visit Island lake and have it to yourself. We started from the trailhead at 8:30 a.m. Next time, we'll try to start even earlier."", ""I don't recommend taking dogs along for this hike. Too much granite, hard on the paws."", ""One of our family's favorites! We keep going back. So many beautiful and varying things to see along the way."", 'We used this as a first Boy Scout backpack trip for our 2nd Class and above boys.  A good challenge for the new backpacker.    Very pretty so it kept interest.  Snow ball fight in mid - June was a highlight for boys.  Trail is a moderate 1300 feet in elevation.', 'Highly recommend this trail. Keep hiking another mile for an even better experience at Island Lake. Glad we went Friday and came out Saturday because there were too many people coming up on Saturday.', 'We started by following the trail around Wrights Lake and then headed up to Twin Lakes.  The trail can be easy to lose as you cross over large areas of rock, but it has been marked with spray painted arrows.  This trail is narrow and challenging at times and it maybe longer than it claims... So give yourself a little extra time.', 'This trail is super fun and packed with great views but the last half of the trail becomes indistinguishable and quite steep.  Once you arrive at twin lakes, however, it becomes totally worth it with solitude, serenity and great fishing (the lake is loaded with brook trout.)', 'I have hiked this trail several times at diff times of the year.cool enough in summer to play in snow.

I hiked clockwise like other reviewers have suggested and glad I did. Not as rocky as I thought it would be though. Not much of a view due to clouds and fog but I was not disappointed. Only saw two other hikers. 6.5 hours with a half hour hanging out in the Visitor’s Center having lunch. Can’t wait to hike more trails in this stellar park.', ""This was a challenging one for sure. We started out from the Mitchell Canyon Visitor Center around 10:30am and we went clockwise through Eagle Point Trail. This was the recommended route from many other reviewers, and we are so glad we took their advice. The incline to the summit was at times pretty rough with steep inclines. Especially when you're close to the summit, there were long stretches of just uphill. There is a really nice visitor center at the top for you to learn about the park's ecosystem, and pretty stunning panoramic views of the bay area. It's pretty windy and cold at the top, so dress accordingly. The route back down through the Campground Trail was, thankfully, not too rocky and not slippery, which can be really rough on your knees. It was actually a nice descend as the sun was beginning to set. By the time we got back to the visitor center it was about 5:30pm. My only minor gripe with this trail was that near the summit, you'll see that there are a bunch of cars and tourists that just made the drive up to the summit, and it just kinda takes away from the seclusion you get throughout the entire trip. Otherwise, its definitely a challenging but rewarding hike that you'll be proud to have completed. Just be prepared for it being chilly up top, bring food for the long hike, and bring head lamps just it takes longer than you expect and it gets dark."", 'This hike will easily separate the mountain goats from the average hiker. Expect to finish in 4-5 hours if you are average. I smoked this bad boy in sub 3 hours including all my small breaks. Not the prettiest hike in the world but it’s a great workout if you get after it! Make sure you have decent grip on your shoes... I went clockwise and really glad I did. It will start off steep and have lots of loose rocks. Some parts were pretty tricky to get down (for me at least) because it was so steep and my shoes didn’t have the best traction. Once you make it up to the top it’s a pretty smooth and easy way back if you go clockwise. Holla at ya boy if you get sub 3 hours on this one!', 'It is longer than 12. Great hike overall. For the big ballers. Soreness is a virtue', 'Beautiful hike for the ready and capable. Not a hike for everyone as seen by the hard eating. A nice thing to know is there are water faucets at the top to refill backpacks or bottles.', 'It was a good challenging with a rewarding view at the summit. Some of the roads are rocky, narrow and easy to lose your footstep. Definitely recommend start out clockwise loop because at the end it will all be flat and easy fire roads for your tired legs. We took our time and enjoyed the scenery of rolling hills and mountains. My phone said 14.6 miles total because we climbed up to the summit. There was ice creams (cone and sandwich) at the visitor center for your cold sweet fix. Overall, this is a very nice trail! Prepare to spend quite a bit of time conquering it. No less than 4 hours unless you’re extremely competitive ;)!', 'It’s a very nice trail, but extremely tough if you don’t hike more that 5 miles.  On my GPS it actually ended up being 14 miles because we did climb to the summit.   If you are and experienced hiker go for it, for people like that I’m not in terrible shape but also don’t run marathons it was really tough!', 'Nice hike with many butterflies, birds. Went left at Deer Flat down Meridian Ridge to Bald ridge to North Peak to Summit. Looped down Juniper trail and back to Mitchell Canyon. very enjoyable day.', 'A long hike with lots of uphill but nothing technical about the hike.  We did the counter-clockwise version which was probably a mistake because the downhill is pretty tricky.  Probably best to come down along the fire road.  Nice views from the top.  Best to go in the Spring or Fall, as Summer can be too hot.', 'I seem to have a thing for missing the best hiking time in the spring and starting in the summer when everything is hot, dry, and dying. Did this hike on a hot day (high 80s for most of it). The trail is very exposed so bring plenty of water and sunscreen and maybe a towel for your sweat. There are many spots to appreciate the view but it is very strenuous - we lost a guy on the way up...I hope we see him again someday.\n\nAt the base of the peak, we went the wrong way and reached North Peak instead of the main summit (which is about 300ft higher) so we went back down and back up the right way. It didn’t have much consequence besides taking an extra hour and making us feel kind of stupid. I don’t recommend unless you’re really into radio towers. \n\nAt the summit there’s a cool museum about the history and wildlife of the mountain. The word “Diablo” was used by Spanish soldiers to describe where a few Native Americans mysteriously escaped, but the mountain itself almost literally rose from the depths of hell (i.e below the earth’s crust).\n\nWe also met a cricket with one leg. I asked it how it lost its leg but it just spat at us. I can kind of guess how it lost its leg…or conversely, how it managed to keep the other one.', 'Went on a very hot day (temperature reached about 90 by midday), but started around 7:30 in the morning to avoid most of the heat. Hiked counter-clockwise and glad we did -- the trail was much more technical on the way up, which I prefer. As noted in other reviews, we measured the trail to be about 14 miles instead of 11.9, so that is definitely something to take into consideration. Views from the top of the mountain were really nice as well.', 'Summer is not my best friend for hiking inland because it gets too hot and lots of rattle snakes appear. So to avoid it all I went las Tuesday and started at 6am this 11.9 hike in Mt Diablo. Twin peaks, Eagle peak and Mt Diablo Summit. Elevation goes between 300 to 3848ft going up and down the peaks. There is so much wild life out there! I got to see all kinds of insects, birds, deer, rabbits, bobcat, lizards and small snake. Thank goodness, no rattle snakes this time! The views are amazing!  If you go early it is much cooler and sometimes there is a lining of fog covering the surrounding cities of Clayton and San Ramon. Pretty much golden and dry during this month except if a creek running parallel to Mitchell Canyon Trail. In spring time Mt Diablo turns completely green and beautiful!', 'I did it as a training hike on 6/9/18 and it was such a rewarding and interesting long hike. Pay attention to the trail map as it is quite confusing.', ""We went on a hot day and it was not worth it. It was hazy and the view wasn't anything too exciting. The best part was all the fun critters we saw along the way! There were so many ladybugs, lizards, rabbits, and birds. That was super fun to see! \nWe went counterclockwise; we went up the service road and down the actual trail. Going up was fairly easy, but going down was way harder becuase the actual trail was more up and down whereas the service road was straight up. If it wasn't so hot it would have not been too challenging of a hike. \nIn terms of water, there was a water spicket about halfway up and at the top so that was helpful.  \nPretty much no shade, wear a hat, bring lots of water bottles to fill up at the top you'll go through them all. \nTo get to the summit, it ended up being 13.8 miles and 3,698 feet elevation gain."", 'Clockwise. Worth.', 'Highly recommend this hike during the spring. I saw a bajillion wildflowers, hummingbirds, a family of wild turkeys, lizards, green rocks, and a rattlesnake. Watch out for snakes and poison oak! It’s a long, moderate hike. The trail map on this app takes you to the lower summit but if you want to go to the upper summit it’s only about a half mile added distance. The dirt on the descent was dry so I fell on my butt a couple of times but it was all worth it (I did it counter clockwise).', 'Great long hike. Don’t forget to get a pen abc $6 cash with you. You need to fill a form. They don’t have a pen there. Definitely do clockwise, start early to beat the heat. Gets pretty hot and lot of the trail is exposed. Carry lot of water. Ascending gets very slippery sometimes. Wear good shoes; and a hiking stick is recommended. The wildflowers are in full bloom and some are very fragrant. The water up at the summit is not bad. Also the visitor’s center is cool and they have a little walk through museum, which is cute. They also have water, cold drinks, ice cream for sale. On the way back is all fire roads after juniper campground. Cannot imagine doing it counter clockwise. Fun hike!!', 'worth the afford.', 'I did this hike. it was awesome ha ha I did it all the way up.  joe Smith on 4-28-18', 'Definitively, do it clockwise. Really nice trail going up but be very careful as there is a lot of poison oak along the way. I saw rabbits, hummingbirds, lizards, deer, raccoon and even a snake! Going down is most of the time a smooth ride but the trail is not as nice, as it is very wide (fire road), but despite this it is very interesting as the scenery is different then going up. Took me 5:40hours without counting the breaks.', 'I did it backwards.  About 1/3 of the way up, I took a wrong turn and it cost me elevation.  I am in good shape, but this being my 2nd hike, it was challenging as I inched toward the summit at the end.  Round trip was 14.5  miles and 4,600 elevation gain.  The views were beautiful as the wild flowers were just starting to bloom.', ""Great hike. Very rigorous trail, we did it in reverse so very steep climb to start the day with a gentle slope to end it. This trail does not actually take you all the way to the summit, that's another 0.46 miles and ~200 feet of elevation gain. Overall we tracked around 15.0 miles with a few wrong turns and a hike to the summit."", 'Great hike! Especially loved Eagle Peak. The route (excluding the short detour in my recording) is closer to 13.5 miles as opposed to the 11.9 miles stated on the hike profile. There are water fountains at the top of Mount Diablo to refill water bottles, but still bring lots of water.', ""Longer than what's on allTrail(11.9), I did it in 13.5 miles, so be prepared. The first 1-2 miles are very flat and nicely shaded, but never be fooled by this part. A little before 2 miles it started to ascent for 4 miles over 3000 ft. \n Descent from the summit was challenging in terms of protecting knees and techniques of going downhill, there were a bunch of very steep descent.\n The last climb to Eagle Peak was brutal, especially after almost 10 miles, but short. After Eagle Peak was again very steep descent. Trekking poles and knee protector are recommended.\n It was a nice trail, beautiful, and a nice workout! Go for it!"", 'nice  hike but very challenging.', 'Excellent views.. Gotto see a lot of wild Flowers and birds. Gets pretty hard on the knees, on the way back down.

Then out to north peak from prospectors gap, and to the summit.  I met up with an impromptu trail buddy, and we descended through juniper trail down to Mitchell canyon road.  my total mileage was 15.2, and I'm bushed.  This is a fantastic place to hike, and kudos to my trail buddy who won't be named.  If it weren't for the intellectual conversation we shared on the return journey, I probably would have been miserable. Also, there was an abundance of wildlife to see.  Birds of unending variety, rabbits, squirrels and even a few blacktail deer."", 'This hike was spectacular! We did this after not having hiked for a while so it was a great workout. We went counterclockwise first, as this was very steep and going down would have been hard going on the knees and toes. Nonetheless, my thighs and calves were burning up the ascent and we had to take some breaks. Had great views, passed through forested areas, streams and vistas. I really loved this hike! The point at the summit near the observatory was a bit anticlimactic as there were many people who just drove to the point and it didn\'t feel as ""one with nature"", but I wouldn\'t have felt right not making it to the summit. Overall, it was a great hike and highly recommended.', ""We did it way back in July of 2016. OMG the summer heat just about killed us. Seriously, we ran low on water and barely made to the summit but when we got there it was all worth it. We took a long break bought some ice cream bars and cold water and layed down to relax. We started at Mitchell Canyon and was curious so we ended up 14. 25 miles. Going back in two days this time in March weather and forecast says sunny and 68 degrees. Sounds great can't wait!"", ""I wouldn't say this is an easy hike but if you are contemplating whether you should do this or not due to all the people saying it's hard, just go do it man.\n\nMy buddie and I got to the top in 3hr and down in 1.5hr. What more do I have to say?"", 'Great day of hiking celebrating another friend hitting “Mile 60 on the trail of Life!” Our first time hiking Mt Diablo- tips: Check weather before you go- we layered up and glad we did as the wind was in full force as we approached the Summit - go CLOCKWISE when making this hike, the fire road is much easier coming down ( not near as pretty- but easier) plan on 8 hours. Including a couple “snack and map” breaks, pictures and lunch it took us 7 hours 41 minutes. Challenging however doable.. We used hiking poles and found them beneficial.

One of the best holidays I can remember!', 'Figure Eight Loop to the Summit and back.  Excellent hike.  Highly recommended!', 'Hiked it on Sat. Awesome hike. I was glad I read on a review here to go in clockwise direction. Only way to go, get the steep rocky single track done then have a mellow hike back on the fire roads. I’d have not enjoyed coming back down the rocky single track. Was impressed by the diverse ecosystems on the mountain. Stop by the visitors center at trailhead and pick up free printed directions. I also bought the Hikers Guide book which was put together by volunteers who have extensive experience on the mountain. I’m excited to see how many hikes and trails there are at Diablo. My only gripe is the parking lot doesn’t open till 8:00 which is a late start for long hikes.Next time maybe the Five Peaks Trek. 14.5 miles, 6280 cumulative climb. Page 36 in guide book.', ""Was a great hike! But, the next time I will start earlier (started around noon this time). The kind volunteer at the visitor center warned me that I would be cutting it very close as sunset was 6:54 PM today (they have sunset info at the visitors center too, super helpful).My climb on the Meridian Ridge got really tough, and had it not been for Brigitte and Chris (strangers, and fellow hikers who motivated me to continue) I may have quit amd turned back! Thanks guys!! Happy Anniversary again! :)I finished at 7:52 after pretty much jogging the last 3.67 mi on Mitchell Canyon Road. It was way past sunset, but it was a starry night and I could see enough to find my way back. So, it wasn't too bad even though my powerbank/flash light gave out on me! I ran into a group of Boy Scouts from Walnut Creek who graciously lit up my way for the last 1/2 mile! Thank you Boy Scouts!!Lessons learned - Start early! It's no fun hurrying down Deer Flat Road and Mitchell Canyon Road when you are exhausted! Even though the roads are as flat and stable underfoot as unpaved, fire roads can get.Budget a lot of time for Back Creek Trail, even though it is very arduous, it has amazing views! So give yourself time to relax and take it all in.There is a lot of Poison Oak on this trail, stay away! Brigitte educated me that the easiest way to recognize this plant is their leaves are in clusters of three and that they are one of the first to turn color (green to red) in fall. Every Poison Oak plant I saw had bright red leaves.I didn't especially enjoy hiking alone, so bring a buddy along!The Visitors Center up at the Summit closes at 4 PM. Get there before then of you are planning to buy a snack there.Though they have restrooms at the Summit, and they are fairly clean, I think the restrooms at Juniper Campgrounds are cleaner and better, so you may want to use those.Lastly, enjoy your time on the mountain! This was my first experience of hiking Mt. Diablo, and I have done only 2 hikes over 10 miles in the past, so this one was one tough mudder for me, but I am stoked that I persisted and got to the Summit, the sense of accomplishment you feel when you get back in the car is indescribable!"", 'Portions of this trail are *very* steep. Who needs switchbacks anyways, right? But hey, you can buy cold drinks and snacks halfway through at the summit. Went clockwise - second half after Diablo summit is almost entirely on a fire road. Fun one! Great for backpacking training. Would not recommend for trail running due to the nature of the first half of the trail.', ""This was a brutal 6.5 hour hike, but totally worth the challenge.  I'd recommend this route which I've tried yesterday when it was around 70-80 degrees and will try again (not recommended for ultra novice hikers, however, due to the steep/narrow/long trails): \n\nStart from Mitchell Canyon Visitor Center --> Back Creek Trail --> Bald Ridge Trail (very narrow/steep path filled w/ poison oak) --> North Peak Trail --Summit Trail (top) --> (descending) Juniper Trail --> Deer Flat Road (immediately after the juniper camping ground) --> Mitchell Canyon Road. \n\nMake sure to grab a free map of the trails at the Visitor Center before starting. There are many intersecting trails and it would be quite difficult without a map."", '4 of us hiked it today including my 13 yr old son. 3 hr hike up got a lift down. 7.3 miles was a huge accomplishment, very proud of him.', ""I completed the summit hikes yesterday.  It was below 80 degree and the weather was perfect for hiking.  I went up on Back Creek Trail, which is a strenuous steep ascend.  But the trail is pretty well maintained and easy to negotiate, comparing to Eagle Peak Trail.  And the trail continued to Bald Ridge Trail and Summit Trail.  The view at the summit was excellent.  It was a bit crowded at the main parking lot.  I went to the other side of the summit where there are plenty of picnic tables and a clean restroom with hardly any people.  That is the perfect place for a picnic after the thigh busting hike.I took the Juniper Trail, Deer Flat Creek Road and Mitchell Canyon Road back to the Mitchell Canyon Visitor Center.  This is an easier route as it is fire road most of the way, and it is wide, smooth and not as steep.  As a bonus, I saw two tarantulas along the way less than a mile from the Visitor Center.This is one of the toughest hikes I've ever done.  It's definitely worth it."", ""The hike is amazing but very exhausting. The feeling of having conquered the summit feels amazing. On the way down, mitchell creek is a gorgeous place to sit on a bench and do nothing but relax. Let be break it up based on experience of hikers.If you are a novice or an amateur hiker, then I strongly recommend hiking the Summit via Mitchell canyon road and descending the same way back. I DO NOT recommend hiking up or down via Eagle peek trail or bald ridge trail. These trails are poorly groomed, very narrow, lots of poison oak with snakes and tarantula and has a lot of loose gravel making hiking in any direction harder. If you still want to do it, then I recommend ascending via eagle peek trail and bald ridge trail. The loose gravel makes descending prone to ankle injuries and puts a lot of stress on your knee. Hiking down Mitchell creek trail is easy and fun.If you are a pro hiker, then it does not matter what I think. Do whatever pleases you.To all hikers, carry atleast 4-5 liters of water because there are no water spigots along the trail till you pretty much reach the summit. This is specifically true if you plan on taking eagle peek trail and bald ridge trail because it's more strenuous. Also consume lots of electrolytes and salts. There are water soluble electrolytes that you can just add to your water. I did not do a good job of consuming electrolytes and my legs started cramping which made my ascent much more difficult. Try to avoid days where peak temperature exceeds 95F. Start early (8AM if you can) beat the heat.it's a great hike and the views at the top are fantastic."", 'This was such a great hike... but be warned: it is a difficult hike. Do not recommend this to a beginner. Avoid it on a hot day (that alone drained me!) and be prepared with the right shoes & lots of water. I must say, the feeling of accomplishment that comes from this hike is amazing.', ""If you go clockwise, the views of the hike till the summit are beautiful! I'd definitely recommend doing this trail but sincerely avoid the summer. We were more tired because the sun was burning down on us (we started at 9:45 am). The bad news is that there are handful of benches to rest on given the length of the hike, there weren't even enough rocks you could find to perch yourself on! Having said that, I can imagine how beautiful the views are when hiking this in spring! I'd definitely go again then :-) Tip- Carry lots of water and snacks to munch on. The visitor center at the summit has beverages so that's a big plus!"", ""Amazing hike! Be prepared as this is not an easy hike! Beautiful vistas. Best part of trail is the wrap around of the peak to Devil's elbow where you get the view of the south side and partial west side. Last part of ascent is taxing on the quads but the reward is the summit and the observation deck. It was a gusty day which was appreciated as it cooled us off. From Eagles Peak across Bald Ridge to Prospectors has a lot of bushes and trees to push through which make it more difficult and the up and down grades are challenging."", 'Harder than expected, and our GPS watch said 14.3 miles instead of 12.3.\n\nPros:\n- proximity to Bay Area\n- strenuous\n\nCons:\n- loose ground\n- bugs\n- mostly unshaded\n- scratchy shrubbery\n- unrewarding - peak is easily accessible by car', ""The whole thing felt like an incline! 14 miles in 5 hrs, but that was with me running a portion. For a less strenuous hike take Mitchell Canyon to Juniper. Wear a hat and sunscreen cause it's in the sun the whole way. Great vistas which every way you choose."", ""I turned this into a 4 summit hike/run which looks just like a chicken. If you're strictly hiking this then it's definitely an all day hike and probably as hard as it gets but well worth it. You are able to summit all 4 main peaks in one day and get a leg burning workout since this involves about 5k in elevation gain. Great terrain (you only backtrack a little after the main summit) but watch out for the poison oak and bring plenty of water especially for the last Eagle Peak push since it's exposed and the sun will be fully up by that time. I would suggest bring at least enough water to reach the main summit where you can refill. Don't give up after the first peak, that's going to take a lot out of you since it's the furthest climb up but after that it's smaller ascends/descends."", ""This was the hardest hike I have ever done.  We thought we would be fine since we are young and exercise regularly. I would only recommend this hike for advanced hikers who don't mind rocky cliff edges. We started on the side towards eagle peak. I am glad we started this direction as it was the much harder side. It started out fine, going up and downhill but slowly more uphill. After about an hour though it was all a very steep uphill. I found myself walking much slower than normal and it was very hard mentally to keep going.We finally reached the top of the mountain and took a quick break. I was relieved and thought the worst was over. Boy was I wrong. Right after was the worst.Going down the mountain then we were on an extremely narrow path on the edge of the mountain and it was a very steep decline full of loose rocks and gravel. We had to get down on all fours and painstakingly crawl down to avoid sliding in all the gravel and falling off the side of the mountain. It was the most terrifying thing I've ever done. My hands are covered in tiny cuts from it.Then, it's another steep climb uphill to the next peak. We took another break and decided then that we couldn't do the full hike. It had already been 3.5 hours and we weren't even halfway.Luckily shortly ahead was where the trail split into a bunch of options. There was a nice wide, flat dirt road that connected with the Mitchell road and would lead us back. We took this. Wow it was incredibly easy after what we had just down. It was basically just a gradual decline on a huge road the rest of the way back. Even so the hike we did was 11 miles and took us around 5 hours. There was no way we would have made the full hike. I don't know how people do it."", 'Great hard hike. Steep', ""Mitchell Canyon is such a lively place early in the morning! I saw so many bunnies, quail & deer having breakfast... always a nice way to start the day. The hike in isn't too bad, especially in consideration of the elevation gain. However, as other hikers have stated - making your way down is a beast! Summit & North Peak trails are fine... but Bald Ridge was fairly challenging to navigate. If I wasn't dodging poison oak, I was trail surfing on loose gravel. By the time I got to Eagle Peak, I opted to travel down Back Creek Trail before cutting over, which was a little kinder & gentler + wider. Might try this again in reverse, taking Juniper/Deer Flat/Mitchell Canyon back instead - assuming Eagle Peak & Bald Ridge are easier to navigate heading up & when I'm less tired. The views and wildflowers were spectacular!!"", ""Well, it's a hard hike. Climbing up, the trail breaks into three distinct section: (b) the start is flat for a couple of miles, so you are barely getting warmed up; (b) the middle section is an even-graded climb to 2,900 ft, not too difficult, and (c) the final 1 mile is a steep path up to the top that is bound to slow you down and burn some calories. \n\nBut the bigger deal is actually getting down. It is unexpectedly hard and took us by surprise. It took us LONGER to get down than to come up! The path alternates between steep, rocky and quite difficult descents with frequent raises in elevation to take you through the hilltops of every nearby peak along your way. It took me and my companion 4 hours 12 minutes to get to the top and 4 hours and 30 min to get down.\n\nThe hike is beautiful and massively rewarding. Just make sure you are prepared for what it has to offer."", 'The start to the summit is uphill most of the way. the decent is even. overall a great work out and great hike.', 'Great trail, definitely long and tiring, but well worth it', 'Great hike with amazing views. A very rock trail on the way down', 'such a lovely trail to be on... the soil is rich with history.', ""I enjoyed the hike but the payoff at the summit was disappointing mainly because there's a visitor center, accessible by road, at the top. Kind of takes away from the feeling of accomplishment after the climb when you're surrounded by a bunch of people on the summit who drove up. It was cloudy the day we went but I imagine the views are great on a clear day. I agree with other reviewer's comments about bringing layers because it can be cold and it's definitely a full day hike."", ""Definitely a difficult full day hike - get here early.Note this route doesn't include going to the full peak. In actuality, it is about 14 miles total for the loop.Great views on a clear day! Bring a jacket as can get cold."", 'it was cool', 'Incomplete\n--------------\n\nMy friend and I have been going on a lot of hikes recently, which had some strenuous bits, but we’ve been looking for something that’ll really put our young, fit, healthy bodies to the test, and this was it!\n\nWe left San Francisco around 11:15am and arrived at the bottom of the mountain around 12:30pm, only to find out that we were on the completely wrong side of the mountain... It was about a 35 minutes drive around the mountain until we found ourselves at the visitor centre. We payed the entrance fee and started preparing for the long journey ahead. We put on our athletics shorts, overly long socks, matching Merrel shoes, and leathered sunscreen all over our bodies. I got my hiking tank top on, while my friend put on his drift shirt. I made sure my ponytail was nice and tight, while my friend put on the headband around his head. We we ready, and in typical fashion, started our hike at 1:30pm: prime heat time.\n\nThe first 30 minutes on the hike was on completely flat ground and kind of acted as a warm up (literally) for the trip ahead. Anxiety kept building up as we knew that we’d have to climb more than 3000 feet over 14 miles, but the climb still has not yet started. After about 30-45 minutes, the ascension began by which point we were already very warmed up.\n\nIt’s a relatively long and steady, but not very steep, climb that lasts more than an hour. We took regular breaks in the shade, kept ourselves hydrated and enjoyed the views as our elevation steady increased. We made a note that we should have brought extra sunscreen with us.\n\nAt about 3000 feet we found a campground where people drive to for car camping. Here you could refill on water, go to the restroom, and even take a shower! The facilities seemed relatively new and are very well maintained. This was a good place to take a break and enjoy the views because it was followed by a very difficult 600 foot climb to the peak. By this point we were already pretty fatigued and just wanted to get to the top. As we climbed in silence, my friend and I both dreamt of an ice cold pepsi, full of sugary goodness. Our blood sugar levels were definitely dropping and we weren’t drinking enough because I could taste the salt in my sweat.\n\nThe very peak had beautiful well deserved views, benches to sit on, shade to rest in, a restroom to freshen up in as well as water to refuel on. There was even a pokegym we managed to own for a mere 2 hours before someone else took it over. We ate our granola bars and relaxed for about half an hour before proceeding. It was so hot we were able to have our shirts dry off under the steaming summer sun.\n\nThe road down was even more difficult, to some degree, than the road up. It was hard on the knees, quads and shins. Most of the road was composed of gravel and winded either up or down with very little flat stretches. Our steps were small so as not to fall, and we had to take them one at a time. Ultimately, it took us longer to come down than it was to get up.\n\nAbout an hour after we started our descend we faced a bit of a surprise: we started climbing up again. By this point we had already soaked in a lot of sun, were relatively tired and just wanted to get back to the car. However, it turns out that the trail wanted us to climb back up another 500-1000 feet so we could look around from Eagle Peak as well. I had already mentally decided that the climbing was done, so this part really got on my nerves. I powered through it and tried to get to the top as fast as possible. I would say this was the most difficult part of the hike because of the mental state that I was in at this point.\n\nFrom here, it was a very slow and steep 2 hour decline back to the car. Luckily, we got to see the sun set and enjoyed some amazing views as all the helms started casting shadows. The golden gas was lit by the setting sun, and I would say that it was worth it.\nWhen we reached the car, we could’ve have been happier. We were exhausted and just couldn’t wait to get home. Drank some water, took off the stinky hiking shoes and started riving to the nearest mcdonalds for a well deserved pepsi.\n\nOn the way we saw a popeyes and with no hesitance change our plans in favor of an 8 piece chicken meal with a pop drink. They ran out of coke/pepsi, but coke zero still satisfied my craving. I can also say with confidence that deep fried chicken had never tasted so good.', ""Parking is $6 per car, you pay just before entering at a kiosk. Restrooms and a visitor center are available at the trailhead. The parking lot opens at 8 A.M and is accessible until sunset.\n\nUnfortunately, my father and I didn't pick the best day to undertake this trail. There was a race (~25-30 runners) that required us to frequently step off the trail. It was tough to get into a rhythm heading up, which made this trail more difficult. We were able to get to the junction of North Peak/Mount Diablo in a bit over two hours. \n\nThe map on AllTrails calls for you to summit Mount Diablo. I decided that North Peak was a better option; Mount Diablo's summit is basically a parking lot, whereas North Peak attracts exponentially less hikers. The only downside is that there are multiple radio towers at the top of North Peak, so you can't fully enjoy the summit. Eagle Peak is the only peak that offers a secluded view of Napa and the bay.\n\nThe trail up to Mitchell Rock and Eagle Peak is strenuous, and the remaining trail up to North Peak/Mount Diablo is calf-busting. The route my father and I took (Mitchell-Eagle-Junction-North Peak) had six miles of continuous, unrelenting uphill that will make even the fittest of hikers gasp for breath. The added hindrance of ~90 degree temperatures- and little shade- requires you to drink a lot of water.\n\nDepending on which route you take, about 30% of the trail is on a fire road. The rest of the trail is narrow with terrain, ridges, and occasionally loose rocks. I highly recommend bringing hiking poles to aid you in these areas. Hiking shoes are a must. \n\nOverall, this was a decent outing and I'd do it again. Be wary of the crowds and check for races/marathons ahead of time, especially if you're going on a Saturday. Additionally, check the weather- temperatures climbed as high as 95 degrees Fahrenheit once we got back to the trailhead (1:00 PM.) Have fun!"", ""I've done it several times.  Best to do in the spring since there is a lot of sunny open space.  In the fall you have a chance to see a few tarantulas.  One one of the hikes I was able to see a migration of lady bugs that were close to a foot deep on and around an old stump.  Good views and a great workout..."", 'The best', 'Completed this hike 3 times. It is an amazing view from the top. Both being to see the Bay Area and the valley at the same time. The fact that you can drive to the top makes it way busier than it should be. Making it easy for people to just drive up and take pictures. Nothing wrong with that at all. But I do feel that you would appreciate it more if you hike the trail instead. Either way, the view is nice and it is a workout. Getting to Eagles peak is a awesome spot not a lot of foot traffic and you. An really take in your surroundings', 'First time hiking Mt. Diablo, my wife and I hiked the loop from Mitchell Canyon to the Summit. Bring lots of water, we refilled at the Summit. Good mix of flat and steep inclines. Take the Bald Creek trails up and the Deer Flat and Mitchell Canyon trails down.', 'An extremely strenuous hike if you start at the first parking lot and hike all the way you the top.  Bring food and plenty of water.  Consider hiking a shorter portion.', ""Challenging but definitely worth it in the end. Went to summit the mountain on a friend's birthday. Some steep and narrow paths. You come across some recognizable areas along the way. Was a bit dry, but there was still plenty of green on the mountain since it rained not too long ago. The views are amazing and I really recommend this if you're looking for a challenge."", ""Great hike--As you approach the summit (Summit and Juniper trails) the trail signage becomes ambiguous so I ended up doing some back tracking a couple times, but once you are away from the populated summit area and on to the more remote trails (Bald ridge and Eagle peak) the signage is much better.  It was hard-going coming down off the mountain (I did the loop counter clockwise) because the trails were very steep, gravelly and slippery, but then my knees aren't what they used to be, either.  Other people run back down so I think it all depends on the strength of your legs that will determine how long it will take you to get down.  It took me much longer coming down than going up!  The views are great and I highly recommend this hike"", 'Great hike with my 9 year old daughter.', 'I enjoyed this hike went to Eagle Peak first then on to Mount Diablo Summit.  It was a cold foggy day on top that limited the view but that was ok.', 'Fantastic hike, a little slippery on Eagle Trail.', 'Fun, but hot and some parts are like riding on marbles on a snooker table', 'Great trail.  A bit hard but very satisfying when you get to the summit.  Beautiful wild flowers and gorgeous views of the Bay Area and the valley!', 'Great views of California from the summit- however I would go in the spring. We went in the fall and everything was brown. Having said that I would not do this hike again. One and done. Long and strenuous. A great challenge though.', 'Vigorous hike!!!!!inclined up hills,love it!!!we hiked it all the way to summit & mostly jogged going back.eagle peak,north peak,south peak...21 miles finished in just over 5 hours.definitely doing it again.', ""Tough climb to Mt. Diablo. At the end of the hike you ask yourself why, oh why, but then you look around and up and realize - well it was worth it...\nStart the ascend and the trail tells you right away - it will not be easy. First couple of hours and you make it to Eagle Peak. Luckily you can still apreciate the view and pat yourself on the back. Because now you start the main ascent to the Summit. Loose gravel, narrow trail, walking through bushes... Trip to the summit, and you'll feel that you earned the break at the top. That is about 5 hours in. And then... Then you are rewarded with a nice descend when you can actually enjoy the views, enjoy the silence, and be astonished looking across to the mountains that you actually made it that high up.\nThough it says 13.3 miles - initially the screen showed over 15. Guess it correlates to the map once the dust settles, but it did feel like 15. Plus 3500 ft gain... Four stars - because there is still an ultimate hike out there with 10000 ft gain"", 'Gear: took  2-3L of water. Refilled  2L of water at Mt. Diablo peak. Maps 3D app of trail.

Walking sticks help preserve your back and bring a lot of fluids if your going to push up the hills.', 'My favorite mountain all year around.Did all four Peaks - Mt. Olympia-North Peak-Mt.Diablo and Eagles Peak in one day.Roughly 19miles and 4.800ft. gain.Great training hill .', 'This was a difficult hike, perfect for accruing miles and elevation gain. My group also began this trek from Regency Drive and, for a challenge, opted to summit Mt. Olympia, North Peak, Main Summit, and Eagle Peak (in that order). \n\nThe trails are in good order and a few amenities (toilets, small shop with snacks and memorabilia) can be found at the main summit. Nice views of the area and one can see the Golden Gate Bridge from the main summit.', 'This hike is no joke. My knees and feet got wrecked on the decent but the views (and the sense of accomplishment) made up for it. I did not actually start at Mitchell Creek but there are many ways to get to the summit of Diablo this is what I did. Starting at Regency Drive walk briefly on Donner Creek Trail to Back Creek Road - Back Creek Trail - Bald Ridge Trail - North Peak Trail - Summit Trail. Once you get to the top you can choose to double back the same way you came up or I took the following way down Summit Trail - North Peak Trail -Prospectors Gap Road - Middle Trail - Meridian Ridge Road - Donner Canyon Road. This route was about 11 miles and took me about 5 hours. \n\nThe route I took up had a surprising amount of shade, which was greatly appreciated because I did this hike on a hot day. On the way down, I was definitely more exposed to the sun; Prospectors Gap Road, Meridian Ridge Road and Donner Canyon Road are all wider fire trails. You should be prepared with a good amount of water (there is a water fountain at the summit to refill), sunscreen, food and some sunglasses. If you live any where near Mount Diablo this is a awesome hike that you should check out. \n', 'The trail is a wide road and we picked a hot day to hike it.

summer I took my grandkids on this hike, we enjoyed it so much. The beauty of the trail and waterfall was astonishing.', 'Easy trail with a gorgeous prize at the end !', 'Not a difficult hike and not to long, the views are gorgeous. The waterfall had plenty of water it was the perfect spot for photos.', 'Just completed this hike on December 27th 2018. It was a little more than 2 miles to the Frozen waterfall. good for dogs and people of all ages. Sun was shining, snow on the ground, slightly cold but overall a great hike!', 'We did this hike as a family and loved every minute of it!  The falls was frozen over and it was amazingly beautiful!', 'My first hike ever! My girlfriend took me here in September and it was so easy and rewarding. It was our first hike together. So yesterday we decided to go back to take a better picture and we were pleasantly surprised when we saw the frozen falls! What a beautiful sight!', 'Did this trail on 7/21/18. Drive up to the parking lot, it is about 3 miles off of the road and makes the trek much more enjoyable as the road leading up to the trail is quite steep. The falls are beautiful but to get close to them there is some rock climbing necessary. There is a nice little spot to get into the water weather permitting. In late July it was about 85 degrees and would have been nice to get in.', 'Went with 2 friends on 11/11/18 and found the waterfall completely frozen over. We arrived early in the morning around 9am and it was empty and the road itself was a bit bumpy but I was driving slow like a turtle and avoiding the bumps and holes along the way. A bathroom is available at the trail entrance but there is no toilet paper provided so heads up. Trail itself is pretty easy, and we passed someone pushing a stroller on our way back. Trail itself ends at the waterfall, had a great time...worth the drive and the hike.', 'Great trail for the whole family! My husband and I took our daughters (4 and 2 years old) 10/28/18 and they absolutely loved it! It wasn’t busy at all when we went (1:30pm) and we even ate lunch at the top of the trail! The girls needed hoodies since it was a little chilly by the waterfall. It was a gorgeous day!', 'Beautiful hike. It was definitely warm and a very busy day. The trail was easy but we didn’t get to check out the falls close up, just from afar as several huge families were there sitting on the trail, quite annoying. We will try it out again. Went in late August 2018 before school started.', 'Just as reviewed. A nice short hike. Took small dog and he did well. The earlier you go the fewer people. Got busier closer to noon. Great views and decent birding.', 'Great hike for the family and with dogs. Short and sweet, only takes about 20 minutes to get to the waterfall. Beautiful views!', 'nice trail .', 'Parked at bathrooms and hiked up slight incline but very manageable for my husband and I who are 48 & 50 years old. Views were pretty and path was clean.  We stayed further back from falls and decided not to take on the larger boulders that were closer to the falls and still enjoyed the beautiful sight & sounds of the falls and creek. Amazed there was still as much water as there was in September. Our 4 pound Yorkie had no trouble at all either.', 'Nice, well marked trail to a beautiful waterfall that was even flowing at the end of summer. Lots of families with young kids handling it with ease. Just be careful when you get to the falls with little ones- it\'s a big drop down.Also, dont start at the trail turn off. Drive up the dirt road from the trail turn off for 2 miles to reach the trail head. There\'s a bathroom (""biffy"" style) & parking area there. From this point its a 2 mile round trip hike to the falls & back.', 'Very easy hike and a fun dirt road to drive down that starts the trail. Gorgeous views and lots of rocks to sit on and enjoy the scenery', 'So, the description is misleading. This hike isn’t actually long at all. You can drive your car up most of the way to a parking area (would suggest a SUV, our corolla had a hard time). With that said, the short hike to the falls was beautiful, being high in the mountains meant it wasn’t too hot, and the falls itself was a little crowded. Overall worth a stop when exploring the area!', 'Beautiful easy trail. If you have kids, it’s best to drive up the dirt road and start where the parking lot is. Dirt road is a little rough if you don’t have a SUV or truck. But beautiful waterfall at the end. My kids enjoyed it even my 4 year old.', 'I think it some type of steps and / or handrails could be constructed to facilitate a safer decent to the waterfalls pools. Other than that, it is an easy surface to negotiate on the trail and a scenic hike also!', 'Quiet during weekdays. Lower pool is easily accessible from the trail. Some scramble to the top of the falls.', 'Short and simple, with a very rewarding waterfall', 'Good family hike with a nice view at the end.', 'Dirt road entry is pretty rough but the walk is very nice.', 'Easy walk. Loved the beautiful falls!', 'took my hunny it was very pretty', 'Great beginners hike.  It’s an out and back so it’s easy to follow.   Parking lot can get a little full during peak times but people aren’t hanging out there all day long so the cars filter in and out frequently.  Overall, great little hike for families and groups with small kids.', 'Very beautiful waterfall at the end of the trail!', 'Definitely drive up the dirt road all the way to the Sierra National  Forrest sign. This way you won’t wear yourselves out before you even get on the actual trail. We made it too difficult for ourselves. Lol  It’s a beautiful hike with a gorgeous waterfall at the end. Many families are on this trail. We took our Weimaraner. She loved it. This is an easy hike with a slight uphill climb. Don’t forget to bring your water jugs! We will be going again in the early morning for a different experience as we got there around noonish.', 'Super easy hike. It’s a 10-15 min hike if you drive til the parking lot.', 'Easy hike. Took the fam, 3 kids ages 8 and 9 and the grandma. Beautiful view at the end.', 'The trail was really easy to find. It was beautiful and totally work the trip. You can park at the bottom and walk from there or drive up the dirt road and start at the little bridge.', 'The waterfall was really cool and the view was great', 'only a mile to falls after you drive 2 miles on dirt road from hwy 168 so 6 miles from hwy or two miles up and back from trailhead. Get with it  All trails. You are way off!', 'Great access to get under the falls', 'Easy hike. Dog friendly. Beautiful views!', 'Easy hike that is very kid friendly. Be warned - the vault toilet is vile, full of trash and marmot droppings. And bring your own toilet paper if you really want to use it.', 'A beautiful, easy trail for the whole family, young and old alike!', 'This trail was awesome. We parked at the base (not the lot inside) which made the hike a little over 4 Miles. The trail is well kept and easy to follow. Steady incline to the top but not too steep. The falls were beautiful! The weather was perfect. A little chilly when  we got there by 9am but once you get moving, the coolness feels great. You don’t get wet from the falls, just a very little bit of mist.', ""Hiked this with hubby, our 8- and 6-year-old sons and Australian Shepherd on a Wednesday morning, only saw three other people and one dog. Nice family hike, wide trail, about 1.7 miles from the parking lot to the falls and back. There is a vault toilet but completely trashed...diapers, cups, etc. on the ground.  Too bad there isn't a trash can and I agree with Ashley D...why can't people just pack out their garbage? The falls are gorgeous, I wouldn't be comfortable hiking this with my kids when there's a lot of people since the end of the trail is narrow, rocky, and misty."", 'If you continue on the dirt road in your car, it leads to a parking lot which makes the hike much shorter. Disappointed with the gross bathroom and trash left near it. Wish they had a trash can at the trailhead, and I don’t understand why people can’t pack out what they pack in. The trail is beautiful with the surrounding trees and the waterfall is amazing! Went early morning around 9 and we had the falls to ourselves. This was a quick and beautiful hike!', ""Easy, relaxing trail alongside creek sounds and singing birds.  Map is accurate for the 4 mile rt hike, but if you have kids I recommend to drive your car up to the parking lot. From there it's about a 2 mile rt hike.  Waterfall is absolutely beautiful!"", 'The trail is actually only about 2 miles, not 4 miles as stated. Beautiful waterfall though!', ""Directions from the app worked great and there are signs for forest service access road 8S31 coming from both directions of 168. We went on May 23 and the road was open so we drove the SUV up to the Rancheria Falls parking lot. Road up was pretty tough, a standard sized car might bottom out. The parking lot actually has 11 spaces but I recommend arriving early. We got there after 10:30 am and were the only ones there but buy the time we left at noon there were four groups of hikers on their way to the falls and most had dogs. Our group included hikers aged 3 to 75 and incline proved to be too much for a few. Trail is wide, well marked, and clean. Waterfall is amazing and raging now. Recommend holding hands of little kids when cliffside and by rocks. Hike well worth the trip. Bathroom on the otherhand was one of the most disgusting I've ever experienced (it would get negative stars). Nearly every hiker in our group preferred the Indian Pools hike over this one because the entire way you are right next to a river despite being more difficult to follow but these Falls are fantastic."", 'Super nice and easy trail. Still quiet a bit of snow on the trail. The falls are really flowing and the roar is loud! Great time.', 'We hiked Lewis Creek Trail  2 days ago and it was awesome. Great view, many waterfalls. It was very rocky, lots of fallen trees to climb over. My wife and I are still sore from it but we loved every minute.', 'Great hike! Parked at the road and walked in to the trailhead. Makes for about 4 miles round trip. Still quite a bit of patchy snow and a few places were a little slick and scary near the falls, but gorgeous views! Not super strenuous and most uphill at the beginning.', 'We took our dogs and the snow was not too powdery so we were able to walk fairly easily! Beautiful scenery and not too cold! Will be back again!', 'Great hike and beautiful falls.  A little challenging in the snow but worth it.', 'Brr! A little snow on the trail. Stunning frozen falls.', 'A nice long hike. Lots of snow and a little scetchy near the falls.', ""The hike was really nice! There's about 3-4inches of snow on most of the trail so be prepared. The waterfall was frozen too, but still so pretty!"", 'Went on trail in January 2018. Great trail for beginners❤️', 'loved it! the road up to the trail head was a little icey but other then that it was great. The weather was perfect for a January hike. Cannot wait to go back in the spring time.', 'Fun little hike for all ages and dogs. Still not much snow as of 01/04/18. I plan on going back in the spring when the waterfall is flowing.', 'Fun and easy hike with kids. Beautiful in the light snow. Road to parking lot icy but areas to pull off about 1/2 way up.', 'Fun trail. Very quick and easy. Took my (big) dog and was a breeze for him. Trail gets narrow towards the end so we had to let people pass us considering we had the dog. Went in September, late review. Not too much water falling.', 'Waterfall was partially iced up. Nature was beautiful', 'Super short but very pretty. If you make it to the parking lot (which has room for about 6 cars) then this trail is maybe 1 mile each way. The waterfall at the end is pretty lovely though and makes this well worth the drive. We brought our 18 month old daughter in a backpack and our dog and everyone had a nice time.', 'The end of this hike is absolutely beautiful! It is 4 miles if you start right at the turn off from the 168 hwy but if you drive up to where the actual trail head starts it’s about 2 miles round trip. Super easy hike and a must do for all levels!!', 'Excellent trail for family, the walk is short but full of scenic views and once you reach the water falls it’s breathtaking. It is busy on the weekends. Worth a trip though!', 'had a great time on our hike today. The weather was great and the water was amazing. The falls were beautiful and the hike was very nice. there was people of all ages and fitness levels. definitely will go back.', 'it is only about .83 miles from the trailhead.  Very easy hike.  is Labor Day weekend here and The Falls are still running. might be better in May or June', 'Great trail! Make it more challenging by parking right at 168 and hiking to the trailhead.', 'Fabulous Walk...beautiful views!', ""it was an amazing hike the waterfall is beautiful the atmosphere was just beautiful I can't wait to go do it again"", 'Great place for taking little kids or older folk, way easy hike in, 3 miles or a little over round trip. my 2 yr old nephew walked the whole thing. Great waterfall at the end. Great place to pick nick,  very busy spot.', 'Nice hike. Falls looked great this year.', 'Easy, very busy.', 'Waterfalls were worth the small hike! My boys made it and they are 6 and 8.', ""We decided to walk to the trail head from our campground at Huntington Lake. Only thing we didn't realize was that the actual trailhead is 2 miles up a dirt road from the entrance on Hwy 168. So our walk doubled in length. Once we got to the trailhead though the out-and-back to the falls is worth it."", 'This trail is an easy walk/hike, but is very busy. The trail is fairly narrow so it makes it a little bothersome when passing large groups. The parking area only has a handful of designated spots that fill up early. Everyone else has to park on the side of the dirt road which leads to alot of traffic congestion. The dirt road up to the trail head is rocky, bumpy, and about a car and a half wide.  Despite all the most cars can make it to the trail head.', 'Pros- Super easy(kids, even saw some elderly folk)WaterFalls were awesome sightGood , short family tripCons-waterfalls not very accessible(can be but dangerous)Very busy ( we went Friday around 11)Overall recommended for beginning hiker or if you want some cool pics.', 'The water in the Falls is running beautiful right now.  The turn off sign from the main road is well marked.  Be prepared to go a bit on a dirt road before you hit the parking lot for the trail head.', 'Nice easy trail for beginners. The trail is wide enough and smooth enough for jogging strollers. The only caveat is to keep a hand on little ones at the falls. Very steep drops, from damp rocks, into raging waters.', ""Amazing hike! So easy to get to and beautiful the whole way there! The gate is now open to drive the trailhead, it's about 2 miles long and a little bumpy but not too bad. There is no more snow on the ground either. There's a parking lot at the top with a bathroom too! The falls are raging right now and totally worth it! The only problem with the trail is that it's very popular and there's a lot of people there all the time, so while it's not very secluded it still is an amazing and easy hike!"", 'Wonderful hike. Waterfalls was great. Hiked with 3 and 5 year old boys and elderly parents. All of them enjoyed it.', ""Just a short hike. Bring some lunch and enjoy the beautiful water fall. Lots a water coming down and the mist will definitely cool you down on a warm day. Trail is clear but has some small rocks sticking up along the way. Just watch your step so you don't twist an ankle."", 'Amazing trail. Waterfall view is spectacular... had fun time with family and friends.', ""I've been doing this hike since I was a child--so many nice memories throughout the years.  A pretty hike in the forest with beautiful falls at the top.  Great rocks to sit on to take it all in."", 'Short hike, did in a series of same day hikes. Beautiful views, significantly more water than in years past! Great place to cool off with mist from falls and breeze.', ""Didn't expect to see snow up there  made it even more beautiful.."", 'This is a short and easy hike to a beautiful waterfall... and dog friendly.', ""beautiful! went today. a good amount of people out and I can see why! road is still closed leading to the actual trailhead, but it's worth your time. the falls were bursting today and you get great views all along the trail."", 'Road to the trail head is closed which added 2 miles straight up hill to the beginning of the hike and 2 miles back down. It made for a little more difficult hike than advertised. However, every step was worth it when you get to the falls. So much water and so beautiful. It was a great hike!', ""The trail itself is easy, but if the roads closed to the trail (that's a hell of a hike!)Worth it once you're to the top!"", 'great short hike where dogs are also able to come. beautiful trail and waterfall.', 'FYI the gate is locked for the road to the trailhead, at least as of 6/11/17. adds 2 miles each way.', '2 days ago night hike. Snow in a few spots on the trail. easy to navigate with an almost full moon. Had to return the following morning. beautiful', ""it was very beautiful. my daughter hadn't seen snow in a long time. All of the falls were beautiful and it was quiet."", 'UPDATE AS OF 5-28-17: We did this trail last summer, it was very easy and the sights were beautiful. We tried the trail again this weekend and the road to the parking lot is closed off due to a lot of snow still present on the road. The last half of the trail to the falls is also covered in snow at a steep slant. We saw several people slipping and falling. If attempting with snow covering the trail, I would suggest wearing shoes with good grip and go early in the day before the snow gets too slushy.', 'Easy hike with nice views, and a lot of bees. There is parking and a restroom right at the trailhead. The road up is a little bumpy but not too bad. My dog loved it :)', 'We loved it! Easy enough for our 7 month old rottie :-)', 'very easy, but also very crowded.', ""It was a nice walk.  Didn't seem as far as described.  Dogs had fun.  Parts of the trail can get narrow so keep an eye on small children and pets.  People with bee allergies should keep their epipens handy."", ""Trail is an easy hike. We took the dog who loved it. The easy part of the trail ends 40 feet from the falls. It is a boulder hop to the water which we didn't let our dog do. Our dog didn't get to enjoy the water. A great hike through the forest."", 'Nice trail to a scenic canyon and multi-level waterfall. Classic Sierra Nevada scenery. Will be visiting again for the crisp air, peaceful surroundings and serene feeling.', 'Great scenery and weather to match. Water is refreshing at the end of the trail. New to cali and am enjoying my new backyard.', 'Perfect for hiking with kids!', ""Great hike great view well worth it.. Unless you don't like nights or rock climbing"", 'An easy trail for kids! We really enjoyed it.', 'Dirt road to the trailhead is bumpy with lots of rocks and chunks of leftover asphalt, you can make it in a small car if you take it slow at certain points, I have a Hyundai Accent and had no issue making it to the trailhead.  When you get to the trailhead there is limited parking and a restroom at the beginning of the trail.\n\nThe trail itself is well maintained and there was no debris or obstructions the entire length.  The trail is split between nice shaded and unshaded spots the entire length, there are also several spots where you can walk a tad off the trail to catch your breath if need be.  Just about all of the elevation increase is at the beginning of the trail, after that it pretty much levels out the remainder of the way to the falls.\n\nWhen you get to the end of the trail you are greeted by the beautiful sight of the falls, which when we went were going in full force.  The trail ends in a little spot well short of the upper part of the falls, but if you are feeling adventurous you can climb up some rocks and get in for a closer look, there is also a nice rock ledge that pokes out above the lower viewing spot that makes for a good place to take a picture in front of the falls.\n\nWe started the hike at around 10AM and there were 2 groups that had started around the same time and were just ahead of us, we passed a fair number of people on their way back down, as well as several groups with multiple dogs, toddlers, or babies.  Once we were done at the falls and turned back there was a significant increase in the number of people going up the trail, so you are probably better off starting this earlier rather than later.\n\nOverall a pretty easy but enjoyable hike!', 'Beautiful falls, lots of water, perfect weather!', 'Well maintained trail, comfortable hike. +Dog friendly. Able to push jogging stroller the whole way. Bumpy road to trail head before you get to the parking lot. Beautiful falls/scenery. Abrupt drop point render difficult access to actually come in contact w/the water.', 'Really easy and short hike. The falls were beautiful, and managed to do it all in about an hour. Went around 10am and had them all to myself. Definitely recommend.', 'easy trail great falls', 'A very nice hike with a well maintained trail and even a bathroom at the trailhead. The waterfall was beautiful and the hike was easy. There were lots of hikers that brought dogs and kids.  I suggest going early, it started to get too crowded by the time we were leaving in the early afternoon.', 'Nice easy walk to a beautiful waterfall.', 'Nice short hike. Beautiful falls this year. Great to see.', 'Parked below parking lot where the road splits was a 3.2 mile hike from there mostly uphill but totally worth the hike', 'Beautiful!  The falls were amazing today. Some snow still on the ground, and few cars made it all the way up to the trailhead. Only 4wd with snow tires got through.', 'Easy and fun', 'Trail was nice easy my 2 and 5 year old did it easy', 'Nice, short hike with the pup. Even with the low water levels the waterfall was enjoyable because you could walk across and enjoy the pools of water.', 'Easy hike! Loved the waterfall. It was better about four years ago... But still very pleasant today!', 'Short hike, but great view of the waterfall! Worth the drive.', 'Short hike, but a great view of the waterfall at the end!', 'Nice short hike with beautiful falls', 'My parents always took me here as a kid and I still love going. Short, fun, relatively flat, awesome for families. Wet years have roaring falls you can hear as you hike; dry years you can climb over the rocks and hang out at the base of the water. Great trail.', 'Amazing falls', 'Nice short trip to see the falls, if it were not for our drought the falls would be spectacular.', 'Good first time hike', 'Easy and gorgeous.  Water was low so the bottom of the falls was a pool to sit in or wade in.  The kids with us loved it.  Adults loved it. Win, win!!', 'Nice trail, nice waterfall in May.  No reason not to do this hike.  Lowered car/truck might have to hike in from HWY 168.', 'Easy little hike, with a wonderful waterfall at the end. Trail is well kept and well marked, easy to follow. I went in April, still snow on the ground and the gait was closed. I can see it being popular and busy in the spring.', 'Great family hike. Very easy and the kids love the deep pool.', 'Hiked with my wife and 3 kids (4, 9, 11) yesterday for a quick outing while camping at Huntington Lake. The Aspen Trail fire has been raging nearby sending quite a lot of smoke this way. The hike was easy-peasy on a well-groomed, wide trail in most places. Only a few people out on the trail on this Monday that was sunny and about 75 degrees. Lots of area campgrounds had been closed abruptly in the last few days to allow space for the 1,000 firefighters to camp between shifts. Even in late July, there was enough water coming from the falls to say it was well worth the hike. This place must be incredible in late Spring. There were even a few people rappelling down the side of the falls that we watched during a snack break with the kids.  A quick hike back to the car and off we went to the smokey lake for some swimming. ', 'Good hike very easy my wife and I and our dog took the hike in june 2012 nice little 1 mi hike go early kinda crowed after like 10am nice waterfall at top.', 'Pretty, wooded, easy walk on a well maintained trail with shade all along the way. There was a couple with a jogger stroller who made it just fine. ', ""From looking at the location on the map associated w/ this trail, it's known as Rancheria Falls and is at Huntington Lake, at least 16 miles above Shaver Lake.  Signage for the trail coming up the road is non-existent (when you pass the workcamp, you've gone too far), but when you turn around and head back down, the trail is marked w/ a sign.  It's about 1.3mi on a dirt road to a parking lot and restroom.  The trail up to the falls is uphill a good portion, but worth the view as the falls come into sight.  The link added to this review is to the Sierra National Forest Map of the Huntington Lake Area.  There's also an easy trail off the very back parking area at China Peak (previously known as Sierra Summit)."", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '',

We had to rest a lot on the way back, but note that we are not seasoned hikers. It was a good workout though. Try to start early.

It is a truly beautiful hike with sections that are all completely different. Its about 5 miles roundtrip (out and back) and could be difficult on a hot day. \n\nWe started out around 1:30pm on an overcast and misty day and there were beautiful low clouds hanging at the tops of the mountains the whole time. Unfortunately parking is $10 or you can walk a little further and park in the neighborhood outside the lot. Bathrooms in the parking lot are spotless, smell-less, and fully stocked! Woohoo!\n\nAt the far end of the parking lot, there is a sign that you can follow to various trails between 2 and 8 miles. We took the trail to the Waterfall. Its a well maintained trail up until the final fork about a mile and a half in. Anyways, the trail, curves through the park surrounded by fields full of adorable prairie dogs, until you are suddenly aware that you\'re at the top of a mountain above a beautifui lush valley. As you  make your way down, there is a ""Lion King"" rock that is easily climable to feel like you\'re ""on top of the world!"" Sorry, I\'m a quoter. :)  The trail goes down across the peaks of the hills until you enter the forest.\n\nThe forest is full of gorgeous plants and flowers and we even found a cave that we climbed into.  We were able to see a few deer, plenty of different birds including blue jays and hawks, and a couple bunnies. You\'ll come to a fork that will point you towards the waterfall. \n\nFrom here on out the trail is a bit rough. You have to cross the dry (this time of year, not sure normally) river bed quite a few times and then the walls come in tighter and your final sign will say ""Waterfall"". Here you have some bigger rocks to climb over and a couple feel of water in pools of the small stream. It wasn\'t too difficult. On the way back, I did slip and got wet to my waist, but it wasn\'t too cold and turned out to be fun. This whole area was littered with cute little orange salamanders. \n\nThe waterfall is small, but there is a beautiful grotto underneath it and a large rock to the left has a rope with knots that someone has attached to it. I went up first, but didn\'t have enough grip on my shoes. My boyfriend made it up just fine. \n\nThis trail is super easy until you exit the forest on the way back and realize that since you came down a mountain, you have to go back up. I personally love a hike that is also a workout so it was perfect. Not hard by any means but it does get your heart pumping! The whole trip took just under 3 hours but we took our time on the way down taking plenty of pictures. Definitely coming back here! \n', 'This is a great hike and a pretty good workout. The only downside was all of the poison oak. There is a TON and it is thick!', 'It must take a monsoon for the falls to flow at a good clip because I have been here at least a half a dozen times in the past few years and have only seen it trickle.

Not recommended as the creek is dry and path rather bleak. Well groomed, though. Probably great in spring or even the heat of summer. ', ""Fun adventure hike. Trails are well maintained even though the sign that directs you towards the waterfall says trails are not maintained. Other than a few overgrown brush and one fallen tree, you won't get lost. Did not see or rubbed any poison oak. Lots of deer sightings in the early morning. The scrambling near the waterfall can be tricky when your shoes are wet and they will most likely get wet. Unfortunately for us, there was no waterfall, only a small trickle if I can even call it that. Overall, great hike"", ""Not particularly strenuous but good for adventurous beginners. Well worth it as the scenery was beautiful, particularly smooth curvy sandstone walls near the 'leaky tapfall'. Agree with the comments about 'poison oak highway', especially if following overgrown parts of the dried rocky stream bed. Best to wear long hiking pants and lightweight long-sleeved shirt to avoid any accidental brushes with pre-rash triple threat. All in all, a great day out with random sightings of snake, deer, and delightfully abrupt changes in landscape.    "", 'This hike is not nearly as strenuous as All Trails makes it. The inclines are not terribly daunting, and to get to the waterfall from the trailhead takes less than 2 hours. That being said, there are great surprises along the way.

The second entrance is located on Palisade DR, close to sunset blvd, which is the one I came from.\n\nStart the trail and walk for a bit until a fork. On my right the waterfall with a sign that says unmaintained trail. Regardless of the sign, the trail is in pretty good condition, there are just a couple of places where the trail is a bit overrun by nature but nothing major. \nIn order to reach the waterfall, I had to do a little bit of rock climbing towards the end. the  fall was dried up probably cause it's still summer nevertheless finding myself between those rocks still remained very beautiful.\n\nI double back to the fork and this time took the direction towards Topanga Canyon the real start. I had to walk a good chunk in the canyon providing a lot of shade.  I finally arrived to the going up part... At the very beginning of it, when you get to the top, the mountain has a dome shape with a Mayan style carving on the rock. At this exact location, I saw a few blue birds. Probably some Bluejays. I have never seen such birds before and I saw them on both ways. So make sure you stop and look around their nest is somewhere near. Anyway starting from the dome the trail really goes up big time. A kick ass steep trail which I thought took me forever to do.  When I arrived to the top there is a fire road which goes down to the ranch. Off the fire road there are a few other trails that starts. I did not go all the way down cause it was late and I still had to turn around and walk back. The walk back going down was a piece of cake. \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed myself. It was a good and challenging hike with an amazing scenery throughout the trail. I saw a lot of poison oak but as far as I know I must not have touched any since I have no symptoms.\n\nBring lots of water, sunscreen and hats, and don't forget to stop for a couple of minutes to just enjoy your surroundings. "", 'Rather easy trail, especially if you take the right fork on the path to the (cough, cough) waterfall.  But we forewarned, it is ""poison oak highway.""  Gentle path the entire way.

We heard Owls in the Trees :-) it was pretty cool. As we went along the Santa Ynez trail, we took a sharp Right and went UP hill for a while, it was so green & the day was very warm. \n\nComing off the trail, we took  another Right & went UP the fire road to the Eagle Rock. Now that was so Cool!!!\n\nI climbed up the Boulders face and found a few Caves.\nI sat inside one cave having my lunch, a P&J, looking outside to the mountains in front of me, feeling very happy above it all. As I finished my lunch, I thought Id explore around some, and went down the boulders edge. I moved farther down the edge finding another much Larger cave down on that level, very nice. I slowly leaned down to go inside. Wow it was BiG in there, I laid down on my side, & just looked out & thought this would be so cool at night, being up there under the stars, having a sweet dinner.  I loved it up there, I could stay up there all daydont know about the night though, I dont want to wake up with a Mountain Loin next to me LOL!!!\n\nWe finished lunch & headed down the trail again, taking another Right & decided to Run down the Mushe trail to the Trippet Ranch??? I think thats the name, then a Natural trail back up the Santa Ynez trail, and back to our cars.\n\nWe plan to return after some Rains and see what the place looks like then, it should be really beautiful after the Creek beds are full again & the Falls are flowing.', 'Great hike! We started at the trailhead in the Palisades. Originally I thought of it more as a ""wilderness walk"" but once we started climbing towards Trippet Ranch and Topanga it required more exertion. It was nice to have the downhill on the way back to the car though, rather than having to finish the hike going up those hills.', ""Loved this trail for the variety of environments you pass through:  meadow, rocky scrub brush, lush forest along the creek. We did it in running shoes and it was fine. I'm giving this trail a demanding rating instead of moderate for the sole reason that once you get close to the falls, there's a little bouldering that needs to be done.  Pay attention to the trail when you first cross the creek. We missed this on the way back and added a mile to our trek. Saw deer, squirrels by the boatload, lizards, and a snake. Would definitely do this again! "", ""Completed it today and really enjoyed the whole hike. To get to the waterfall- that became almost a misadventure in itself. Like the sign says at the fork in the road- ROAD NOT MAINTAINED- they mean it-!! Me along with some other hikers ended up going the wrong way until a fellow-hiker turned us back the other way. Ended up crossing a lot of streams and did some rock climbing to get to the waterfall. Unlike some of the reviews I read, the timing was good since there was a good amount of water flowing down. Not too sure if others before got to do this, but there is a rope with knots that's secured tightly to a rock above so you can rappel yourself above the waterfall and onto somewhat of another trail. Heading back up the trail was a bit strenuous. Recommend hiking boots for this one.

However this hike would be impossible to complete without getting wet if the waterfall was full and running l. Great hike seriously recommend going with hiking boots instead of trainers.

My toes kept pushing  the front of my sneakers further and my toes became sore. However that was the easy part, making our way back up was comical in hindsight, yes only in hindsight!  We somehow took a wrong direction (his fault really), so this made our way back to Trippet Ranch oh say 2-3 miles longer.

It’s pretty long, it took us about 6 hours total with a good amount of rest stops and picture taking, especially at the waterfall. I would recommend bringing as much water as you can, it gets tiring and can get hot. I went right after the few days of rain and the waterfall was gushing with water. It was beautiful and worth the hike. I would recommend wearing hiking boots.', 'We started hiking at 10am and 59 degrees outside. Perfect weather for this hike. We loved the back and forth along the trail of shade to no shade. It took my sister and I 4 hours to complete the hike to the falls and back to the parking lot. Even though it rained 3 days ago there was no flowing water in the falls. There was only a trickle coming down the face. The trail was damp, but not muddy. Be warned, due to the government shut down the trailhead bathrooms are closed. But the good thing is you don’t need an Adventure Pass to park at the trailhead due to the government shutdown.', 'Good hike, but do it early in the day if it’s going to be hot.  You are exposed most of the day.', 'This was a nice, quiet trail. Ends up being a pretty good workout if you keep a good pace.', 'No water in the falls two days after the rain. The dry ground sucked it all up. \uf641', 'Awesome trail. Gorgeous views.', 'Breathtaking views all around most of the way. The spot where the waterfalls would be was completely dry again though on the May 12th weekend. Took about 3.5 hours to get up there with okay pace and some quick photo stops. 2.15 return. (So, definitely longer than 4 hr round trip as some people have commented)', 'Trail starts in parking lot across the street from the candy store. A little over 11 miles from parking to falls and back, 9.1 miles as stated on app is incorrect. Falls are not impressive but it’s a nice hike to get there nonetheless. A good 4 hours round trip, take lots of water, sunscreen and a hat. Wear good trail shoes, parts of the trail are dry with loose pebbles/rocks easy to slip in the wrong shoes. Lots of pretty wild flowers along the way.', 'Average', 'Nice trail, no water at the waterfall yet. But saw a beautiful big rattlesnake right next to the trail.', 'Had a nice hike through this area.  Meant to go to another trail but this one was great for us.  I would say this one is moderate.  Beautiful cool day.  No water at the falls but we were able to enjoy a nice lunch while we were there', 'First of all the trail head is NOT by the candy store it is right where you park ..I wouldn’t call it moderate but strenuously moderate.. 9.3 miles to the “falls” ( no water).  Lots of ticks..beware and check your dogs. We had fun...', ""Only did the loop, but didn't see another soul on a Friday afternoon. The leg of the trail to San Juan Falls should be called the Heavy Doodie Trail since it is littered with dog poo around every bend. For the love of hiking.. PLEASE pick up after your dog and carry out what you bag."", 'Nice trail for a winter hike but it was quite warm today, about 78. Left at 7:30 when it was cool, finished by 12:30 and it was quite hot. Brought the dogs and found lots of TICKS on them - maybe from the recent rain? I would not have expected ticks this time of year. No water in the falls but a few puddles down stream from the rain.', 'It was a great day with a great hike. But no water was flowing ', 'Definitely go when the weather is clear and cool.  I imagine this trail would be great with more water in the stream beds.  I only saw 1 person on the trail.', 'We hiked this in October knowing the terrain would be hot and dry, but wanted a conditioning trail close to home.  Knowing that, it was a good hike with both oak woodlands and chaparral.  The falls were expectedly dry, but the rock formations were quite cool.

This time of year it gets very hot in the valleys and on hills.  Lots of water or you will regret going.', ""Completed yesterday, nice workout. Wouldn't recommend for summer hikes, but there was still water flowing at the falls. Had my closest encounter with the biggest rattlesnake I've ever seen, not fun. Careful of the hill climb going to the falls...fairly steep in sections and not much sun protection."", ""Did this trail again with my cousin today, but only did the lower loop, stopping off at the San Juan Falls (2.1 miles total) instead of heading all the way  to Chiquito Falls. Once again, remember your adventure pass for the parking lot. We started off on the San Juan Trail again (to the right of the parking lot and headed straight to the first and smaller waterfall. We tried hiking around the lookout point fence to get to the actual base of the falls, but it was fairly steep at one point and we were concerned about the dog making it, so didn't go all the way to the base. There's still some easy to reach photo op points partway down, so try anyway. Watch the rocks though, as we spotted a rather larger rattler snuggled between a couple we planned on traversing.Since we couldn't make the base, we backtracked to the very easy side trail that takes you to the few smaller pools at the top of the falls. This was a very nice place to stop for lunch. I hear it can be crowded on the weekends, but we had it mostly to ourselves on a Thursday at 1 pm.We then completed the simple 2.1 mile loop, which was easy, quick, and enjoyable. Once you pass the junction sign, you technically are taking the Chiquito Trail back to the parking lot, which is a slight incline the rest of the way back."", 'I\'m a casual/slow hiker, so this hike took me all day, from 9 am to 5 pm, spending about 45 minutes at the waterfall.First off, don\'t forget your adventure pass for parking. When you start the trail, begin with the San Juan Trail to the right of the parking lot. Shortly after beginning, you will come across the San Juan Falls. I did as others suggested and checked them out from afar and then headed on to Chiquito Falls so as not to lose time. I do wish I had hiked down and stopped for a bit because the falls were empty of people on a Monday. The trail overall was lightly trafficked on the Monday I went.Continue on through the first part of the loop until you reach the junction sign, where you need to turn right and cross the creek to head to Chiquito Falls. At this point, you travel through a nicely shaded area, so watch out for poison oak and mosquitos, but take advantage of shade while you can.Once you pass the ""tributary"" as marked in yellow on the AllTrails map, the rest of the trail is virtually all climb (except for a small decline to the falls themselves). This is where things get hot, from not only the continuous incline, but from sun exposure. Don\'t just wear spf, but bring it with you and reapply. My day was 74 degrees, but felt in the mid-80\'s for this portion. Take advantage and cool down in the few shade tunnels offered by the oak trees. And beware of bees if you\'re sensitive. They are literally everywhere through this portion of the hike, and you cannot avoid brushing up against them and the plants they are checking out along the trail.You\'ll see the falls from a distance, right before the decline in the trail. They are running great as of the date of my hike, but I hear they are usually dry in the summer. I can\'t imagine the summer heat helping this trail out either.On the return hike, when you make it all the way back to the junction, keep heading right on the Chiquito Trail (or turn left and leave the way you came if you want to see the San Juan Falls again or prefer not to complete the loop). You will hear the highway unfortunately, but the trails leads along a creek and it\'s beautiful and green. Eventually you will come out on the opposite end of the parking lot from where you started.There are fat lizards all over this trail, and most aren\'t afraid of hikers. So enjoy their funny dances and poses along the boulders. Also, as of this post, tons of blooming aloe (most of my other hikes, the aloe blooms are already dead now since they tend to bloom in the winter here).Since I\'m a newer and slower hiker, this trail maxed me out distance wise. The loss of one star was because of the sun exposure and heat issue for most of the trail. Otherwise, I really enjoyed it and might have not had so much of a heat issue had I started earlier than 9 am.', 'This place is amazing!', ""Great hike thru San Juan loop and Choquito falls. Beautiful drive as well! Bring snacks for the resting times. Will definitely go again. A nice bike bar is close by for a beer after. Hell's Kitchen."", ""The incline to get to the falls was difficult for me but totally worth it. The whole trail is beautiful. I agree with another review on here, bring more water than you think you'll need because you'll need more. You do have to cross over moving water twice, so be careful. Good hike, plan on doing it again some day."", 'The prettiest waterfall is on the San Juan loop, but there are a couple small waterfalls  along the way and a pretty one at the end. Took us 4 hours to do the whole thing with our dog.', 'I have done this hike twice now, and it is not my favorite. It is definitely a workout, but is not as scenic as many other hikes. You are trapped on a narrow, rocky path the whole trip with rather uninteresting sights down into the valley. The sun bakes you, even on sub 70 degree days. I do not recommend going during summer at all. The waterfall is nice when there is water, but that also means you will need to cross the stream twice beforehand. Like I said, it is not my favorite but it is still a decent hike. Just remember to bring much more water than you expect and purchase an adventure pass from Big 5 before you go there.', 'I went with 5 children and it was hard for them. we went the Chiquito loop rather than SJ loop an barely made it back. it was rough terrain and hot. the water fall was beautiful.', 'Great hike, a bit warm in afternoon but the falls and swimming felt great.', 'Great hike', '', ""Nice hike.  Just opposite the Candy Store and Bear Canyon/ Sitton Peak hike.   Cross the stream two times and then up to the falls.  Can get hot in late spring and summer so go early.   Parking lot also fills up pretty quick.   The rangers were out writing tickets, first time I have seen this.    The Candy Store sells Pass on occasion but more often then not doesn't have them so make sure you get one before arriving.  Better off just getting the American the Beautiful annual pass for $80.00 for the US National Park Service that let's you in all national parks and you can even use the express lanes!"", 'Awesome, long hike. Definitely go swimming naked in the waterfall, definitely run along the trail on the way down, and definitely get chocolate at the shop on the way out.', ""With as much rain as we've had the trail is very confusing. You have to cross the water a couple times to get back on trail. Very beautiful!"", ""Great trail for a fall hike. It rained the the night before and the morning of our hike till about 10:00am. Landscape and views were beautiful. No water flowing in the falls as it's too early in the season. I highly recommend this one for fall, winter, and early spring.

Started at 2 pm ish. A trail race was happening at the same time in this trail so it was busy.  The trail descends if u start clockwise by the restroom - then meanders around. At ""T"" stay left to follow sign for Chiquito trail and not San Juan.  The climb up is technical and a grind if you are jogging but great views. The trail downhill is rocky -  I went passed the Falls another mile or so.  The waterfall was bone dry and nothing to see.  The trail past the turnoff for the falls enters an area where grasses are very tall and is buggy.  I didn\'t like this part and prefer to be up. However it\'s still nice and shaded.', 'Great! Low traffic being a weekday. One of my favs.', ""I've only been to the Santa Rosa Plateau and have been looking for more trials close to home. My friend took me to this one and I loved it!

Very green this time of year.', 'Beautiful trail!', 'Great', ""We were in the area and saw the trail head for San Juan Loop Trail. After already going on a few hikes that day we decided to check it out and we were all glad we did. We started this trail with the path to the right by the Trail Map sign, it was a nice gradual decent with a few switch backs down into the canyon. The canyon area was very covered with a nice Oak Glen at the middle way point on this trail. The trail itself was pretty shaded most of the way which was nice. As others have mentioned it wasn't extremely busy and the trail was for the most part clean and graffiti free (something that is getting harder and harder to find in SoCal, pity.). Once you reach the campground you have a final push up a slight grade back into the parking lot. This was a very enjoyable hike and through short (2.2 miles) the scenery was great. I plan on doing this hike again when I'm in the area and maybe check out the Chiquito trail as well (which branches off at the middle way point)."", ""If you start at the Blue Jay Campground and take the Upper San Juan Hiking Trail from the campground entrance you walk about a mile and a half to the trailhead for the Chiquito Trail. The first half of this well marked trail takes you through thick scrub oak woods down to the Chiquito waterfall.  From there it's another four miles to the San Juan Loop Trail through chaparral and a rocky ridge. The last two miles is uphill to the Forest Service public parking lot. This shuttle hike will take between four and fives hours but is relatively easy. You will need two cars to get from point to point. This is one of the best hikes in the Cleveland National Forest."", 'Started from the parking lot across the street from the candy store. At the 1.1 mile marker, turned off towards Chiquito trail. A gradual but steady ascent from that point on until mile 4.3. Then the falls will begin to appear on your left. They were dry but nonetheless, a very beautiful and scenic hike. Terrain is a little rocky at times so watch your step and a good 9.2 mile there and back workout.', ""I did this hike probably ten times between last august to this past march. One of my favorite hikes, if you start at the trailhead to the right of the parking lot it's a lot of down hill, to flat, to slowly inclining which is easiest.  If you start on the left side, you end up going up a more difficult incline that you would normally go down the other direction. Takes 30 minutes moving fast, 45-an hour at moderate pace."", 'The trail was well maintained but very rocky and exposed to the sun once you got out of the valley (first 3 or so miles) then very little shade for the occasional break. Went on an 80+ day and 3 bottles of water for 2 people was doable but we probably will pack the larger bottles if we do this trail again. Also the end was anti-climatic as it just starts another trail.', ""Easy trail through nice scenery. In some places, the trail isn't well marked.  We enjoy stopping at the candy store afterwards."", 'This was a nice, short 2.1 mile hike.  I combined it with the Bear Canyon Trail since they are right across the street from one another.   Lots of shade, hills, nice views, and rocks.  One note, the Candy Store no longer sells day passes. The warden will put an envelope on your car and you mail them the money when you get home.

I like the fact that there is a cute picnic area right before the trail ends', 'Trail is currently CLOSED. I attempted to do this trail with my dog and my self. Upon hiking about a mile in i was stopped by a ranger and told myself and all others on this trail had to leave immediately. ""do to hazardous trail conditions""', ""This is a great trail and it is not overused. I hiked here last weekend after the rainfall we had in the area, but I am happy it was not muddy. There were several areas where waterfalls once appeared, but due to the drought there aren't any waterfalls currently. I felt the trail was easy when starting from the side where the San Juan loop information sign is located, but then about 1/2 mile to home stretch after passing the picnic area you have some incline to work with.  This was my first time hiking this trail and it was great, had beautiful weather, and good for all ages to explore. There are restrooms, no water inside to wash your hands but you'll find a water pump just to the left near the parking stalls. The candy store across has drinks, snacks, organic candies, sandwiches, hiking maps and the owner is really a sweetie."", 'Hit this trail earlier this afternoon with my kids, 11, 7, and 5, it was a fun hike and got a little tricky at times for the youngest one but he enjoyed climbing up the rocky sections.

I stopped by on the way from Holy Jim Falls - on the way to Tenaja Falls. Its an easy hike. Perfect for beginners or for someone who is new to the Cleveland National Forest. There was a stream flowing at the beginning, but it was tiny (I imagine it will be dry in less than a week). About halfway through you go through Upper San Juan Campground. It was closed went I passed through, so it was a perfect quiet (if not for the sound of the cars) lunch spot. You need a parking pass to park at the trailhead, but if you do not have one you can purchase on across the street from the candy shop (they also have plenty of snacks and drinks too.

Great scenery and areas for wildlife viewing.', 'Was a good little hike to take the dog out and let her burn off some energy. The Trail it self was pretty tame. A little rocky in the beginning but nothing extreme. The water was not potable so make sure you bring plenty with you before you depart or get it from the one of the local stores. Also the Visitors center is only open on weekends from noon-5pm. All and all this is a great trail to get out off the couch and have some fun in the woods with your family and friends. Enjoy.', ""The San Juan Loop Trail is easy to locate, and makes for a lovely short hike with great scenery.  From the parking lot, you make your way east a short distance before you reach the falls and canyons from above.  You can make your way to the bottom if you're adventurous and sure-footed.  Staying on path, you'll make your way down along the creek and into gorgeous tree covering which leads you to a camp site that appears to have been closed for some time.  There are benches and tables scattered around the camp sites with a central water-well.  It's a perfect spot for lunch.

A little rocky, I am glad I was in hiking tennis shoes vs regular tennis shoes because I would have slid a lot. I kept my dog on the leash the whole time which was a good exercise for us maneuvering on the trail together while not stepping or tripping on each other. It literally is right across from the candy shop. I got a $5 ticket for not having a National Forest Fun Pass. I went at noon and left at two. It was about 85. There are shaded areas, and open sunny areas. We found some tadpoles in the water, the dog jumped right in. Only saw about four other people. It was Saturday afternoon.

I live off PCH, so this is really convenient, as the trail head on poppy ave is @1/2 mile from PCH.   The trail is very nice and lots of greenery, is  narrow in some parts, but just fine.  It reminds me of the Lizard trail in Crystal Cove but not as tough, as there is not many steep hills.   There  is shade on the trail, and opportunity to take your cap off.

I did a quick google search and came across this one and I had never heard of it. We parked on San Joaquin Rd., our total hike was 4.9 miles. We were pleasantly surprised with the shade that the nearby hills and the trees provided...about half the hike was shaded. It was great to hear the water running...we were curious as to the origin of the water. The sound of the birds added to the experience.

Make the journey to the back of the trail. A steady climb with a few quick power climbs nothing real difficult.  Small jumps, burns, bridges, narrow paths, turns and just all around fun. I will say, I would take along a friend. One needs to sacrifice the thrill coming back to go ahead to watch for hikers. Very narrow paths would make it difficult at times for two people to cross on the trail. My 19 year old son and I went 1 hour before sunset and we saw one jogger.', 'This trail was a great experience.  I found it was more scenic than other trails in the area and had a bit more shade than many others around here (but still wear sunblock!).  It wasn\'t a hard trail but the ""easy"" rating may be slightly off (especially when you consider Shady Canyon is listed as easy and this one is a bit more moderate than Shady Canyon). Since the trail is so narrow it seems crazy that hikers and bikers are both allowed at the same time, but the bikers were very courteous/cautious on this trail. If you use the directions feature in AllTrails it takes you right to the trailhead.', ""This trail was a bit hard for me to locate at first.  I parked in the Newport Coast Community Center then walked down San Joaquin Hills Road to find the trail head.  Took my 8year old with me and was worried he would tucker out but the trail was perfect for us, such great exercise.  The trail is a bit narrow in some spots and you get the feeling of being really excluded in some areas.  Lots of variety in terms of incline/decline along the way.  Went on a Saturday afternoon and the entire trail took us about 3 hours there and back.  It was very quiet and we only came across three people the entire time. We saw a few beehives, walked across three bridges, and there was even a cool rock sculpture someone had built.  There is a Menchie's frozen yogurt in the shopping center across from the Newport Coast Community Center to reward yourself at the end :) Would definitely go on this hike again!"", 'Fun and easy hike!', 'awesome trail', ""OK.  It's pretty easy and residential parking was not a problem to find.  Not too busy, the occasional people encountered were mostly locals.  Bikers were careful because the trail is very narrow.  The terrain/landscape wasn't very interesting.  The canyon is narrow and the creek was mostly hidden.  I think it's a convenient place to hike if you're a local, but I don't think it's special enough to go out of your way to get to.  Not too much shade, so I'd wear a hat."", 'Wonderful trail and I had it to myself late Friday afternoon. I heard a lot of frogs chattering, saw many lizards, one large snake and unlimited bird friends. Bring water, more than you think you need- there is little shade on the trail.', 'Nice hike. My nephews (5 & 7) were able to handle it quite well. It fun to look at the cacti and big Newport homes on the surrounding hills. No dogs allowed though.', 'Pretty easy trail, if you are hiking be sure to keep and eye and ear out for mountain bikers. Most that our group ran across were nice and slowed down or stopped for us. Out and back was nice, a few shady spots along the path were nice places to take a break.', 'All Trails has distance wrong...it is 2.6 miles from start to finish -- or 5.2 miles roundtrip. Easy hike with some hills. Narrow in parts and many bikes to contend with, but otherwise very enjoyable hike.', ""LOVE this trail.  the trails are well maintained and marked.  heard some bees otherwise just saw birds but that's ok.  beautiful scenery.  will be back again."", 'Who knew you could hike in corona del mar! Very nice mellow trail. A few slight inclines. Our 2 year old son had fun crossing a few bridges along the way. We saw a few lizards, birds a beehive and a small frog at the stream. Great hike for the little ones! ', ""I really like this trail.  My wife, daughter, and I only had about an hour to do some quick hiking in OC and I found this via my AllTrails app on my phone.  The trail was well marked and very well maintained except for the numerous types of scat on the trail.  Lots of berries in the poo!  I took some pictures to show the well constructed bridges and surrounding area.  We even ran into an Assistant Scoutmaster from my son's scout troop too.  As we only had an hour to walk/hike, we didn't take the trail to its terminus so we'll save that for next time."", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '',

The first 2 miles were the toughest for us, but the views after mille 3 were well worth it. We saw a deer, lots of quail, squirrels, cows, and a gopher snake.

A treat for the kid in you to hike down stairs, to the creek, over bridges and then to climb a 10 rung sturdy ladder. Take your time and enjoy!', 'Beautiful trail for running/hiking. Park at Stinson Beach parking lot (2-3 free electric car chargers are available; advisable to get there before 10am, otherwise quickly claimed). To get to Dipsea trail head, locate Parkside Cafe (faces the beach), and walk in front of it so you’ll be on Adrenal Ave. Walk up Adrenal (if you’re back is to the beach, make a right on Adrenal), to the trail head (~3 min walk).', 'I enjoyed it! The beauty of the trail was second only to the beauty of my companion. Definitely go clockwise.', 'My boyfriend and I hiked this a few weeks ago and we both loved it! The incline wasn’t too bad, and the views were beautiful the entire way up! Lots of different scenery along the hike ranging from beach and ocean views, to the forest, to a waterfall! We passed a few people on the trail but overall we felt pretty alone. We completed the hike on a Friday afternoon in about 4 hours with a long stop at the top for lunch!', 'Fun trail.  The stairs were fine (novice-moderate hiker, here).  Great views of the Bay.', 'Incredibly fun hike!', 'You can also park at the Pantoll Station and hike down to Stinson Beach either from Dipsea or Steep Ravine, and hike back up either way.', 'This was mine and my boyfriends first time at Mt. Tam and it was absolutely breathtaking. I would highly recommend this hiking trail to anyone! I\'m not an avid hiker and I\'m considered a beginner and this hike was completely feasible for me. I would highly recommend you do the hike ""clockwise"" because if you go ""counter clockwise"" you will hit a bunch of steep steps that runs about a mile long and that\'s not a great way to start the hike. You will see beautiful views of the coast and Stinson beach. We\'ll definitely be back again soon :)', ""Hike was great. Very scenic. There wasn't too much water flow, so I'll definitely be going back in the spring time to see those waterfalls. Also make sure to do the hike clockwise. I did it counter clockwise and it was a challenge going up those steep stairs."", ""Being 26+ weeks pregnant, it's very hard to find hikes that were both interesting and technically feasible for a pregnant woman. Thank goodness I found this hike. The trail is well marked and the inclines and declines were very mild, and where its steep, the trail turns into steps.Gorgeous trail, just wish I brought hiking poles for extra stability when descending those steps. Also, watch out for the poison oak.Took one long stop for lunch break and in total about 4 hours to finish at my snails pace."", 'Absolutely beautiful. It has a confusing turnoff point before the stream, but it is worth hiking a bit extra towards that stream.

Big trees, coastal chaparral, cool weather, warm weather and a great lunch break at Stinson beach!! A perfect 14 miles!!!!', 'Did this trail a few weeks back. The start was a little tough for a hike newbie like myself but totally worth it. The steep ravine portion was amazing with the rushing water a lush greenery.', ""Great loop, I've done it many times on sunny days, recently did it in the rain which was an amazing and new experience as well. We had the usually crowed trail all to ourselves and the rain and mist made everything look quite magical."", 'Beautiful!', ""It's the never ending steps lol very beautiful must see"", 'Spectacular, after the big rain waterfalls were rockin. In the canopy of the big trees then pop out into one of the most spectacular views around. Great time.', ""This trail feels like such an adventure. The flowing creek is ice cold and feels so nice to splash around in a bit. It's definitely a bit of a work out, but the beauty of the trees and the ocean makes it so worth it. Would definitely recommend this :)"", 'Nice cardio. If you want to save your knee, go up from the steep ravine trail.  Water level is super low but it is a good hike.  The signs are very confusing to get to that trail.  I will go back there again.', 'lots of stairs but such a beautiful hike!', ""This is one of the best hikes we've ever done. It rivaled our favorite hike of Killarney in Ireland. This trail has ever-changing landscapes, and while we had a cloudy day that masked some of our views, the fog added to the mystique and beauty of the woods.At the loop, we decided to go up the Steep Ravine trail and down the Dipsea trail. I recommend this route because the Steep Ravine trail is steeper and therefore more difficult for descent.We started around 9:15am and finished at 12:15pm. We probably passed a total of 15-20 people on the trail."", 'Love!! A very beautiful hike!', 'Amazing', 'awesome hike', 'Great hike, have done it many times, good leg workout, bring water, I drive from Sacramento to do this hike, solid spot! I have seen deer and coyotes on the train ✌', ""Great stuff, we parked up at Stinson Beach (for free). Got there at 1030am on a Sunday, plenty of space.We headed out initially on the Dipsea Trail, then followed Steep Creek Ravine up to the top. There's a car park and restrooms up there for a quick break.The way out is great, following the water it isn't too steep at all, pretty tame. Completely shaded.Took the Old Mine Trail from there back, which is out in the sun with some fantastic views. Visibility was great we could see everything from Mt Diablo, Berkeley and SF to the Farallon Islands. All from the same spot!Connected back to Dipsea Trail to loop back to the start. Total recorded length was 8.7 miles, in 3 hours.Generally quite tame, it's all up on the way out, all down on the way back. Elevation of about 1500ft, but never too much gradient. We passed kids and grandma's. With the exception of a wooden ladder you need to climb, it's reasonably accessibleWe've driven through Stinson Beach before plenty of times on the way north, but it always looked too busy to stop. It's worth getting there a little earlier and being back in town for lunch. By the time we were leaving (3pm) it was getting VERY busy, on the trails and the parking lot"", 'Hard to spot the trail, well worth it though.', 'I love this trail!  It is other-worldly especially when taken in combination of the ridge trail.  Two different dimensions.', 'Too good to be true.', 'The worst.', 'The Muir woods area is beautifuland the hike was great.There were way to many people for a high rating.', 'If used in conjunction with the ascendingMatt Davis trail, this is one of the best loops in the entire Bay Area.', 'Great trail, with great changes in scenery. I actually think that this trail is almost better in bad weather, just for the feel of it.', 'One of my favorite Muir/Tam hikes. Great changes in terrain, beautiful sites, several small waterfalls.', ""We tried to do this trail in the early summer when the waters would have been higher, but at that time it was packed- some event.  We went back yesterday, it was completely worth it, but will likely go again in the spring or early summer when the waterfalls will be more beautiful.  We went down Steep Ravine, up Dipsea and back to Pantoll via Old Mine.  Other reviews recommended the trail on misty days for the atmosphere, lucky us it was misty almost the entire time we were out.  It was muddy, very muddy in place.  The kids managed just fine all the way through, one balked a bit at the ladder but braved it after all.  The way up was probably the most difficult only the bottom quarter mile or so, stairs, so many stairs.  But after you get past the stairs it's not at all difficult.  Oh and we took our time with the kids, didn't want to push to hard and have them putter out before the end.  "", ""I hike this trail on Sundays and this is my way of being spiritual. It is a moderate trail and with spectacular scenery. There is sometimes a crowd of people, with limited space to park. But that can be overlooked, because once you get onto the trail you don't see to many people.

Fantastic views of SFO (watch planes taking off/landing), and Pacifica at the top!', 'Went on a cloudy and cold day, but still a nice hike.  Not as hard as Mission Peak, but still quite a hill.  Overall enjoyed it.  Will need to go back when sunny so I can see the views.', 'This is a great little hike. Parts are very steep but the majority is a relatively easy paved trail. The true gem is at the top of the ridge where you can see the Bay, the ocean, an old missile silo and where the Bay was discovered. Get here early the parking lot is small and fills up quick.', ""The first part of the trail was paved so it's a little bit harder on the feet. But after that trail, the trail became dirt. The view of SFO, Pacific Ocean, and Pacifica was magnificent. This was a moderate hike with lots of incline to keep your heart rate up and legs working. All in all, liked this hike."", 'My only complaint is the paved trail.  Now that is out of the way, this place is a little gem.  Views are great and there is a little piece of history to learn on the ridge. check out the old missile defense station that is in ruins with some cool graffiti artwork (and some not so cool) for a lession on the recent cold war era past.  It is a little climb to the top so be ready.', 'Should have turned around...i think it was equivalant to 160 flights of stairs so the fit bit says...which led me to my next question, what defines a flight of stairs. Answer:\n""A flight does not equal a certain number of steps, but there are some limits. A flight is one floor of stairs, and does not exceed twelve steps. Flights are usually composed of ten to twelve steps.""  - Ask.com', 'There is a restroom at the top. Another historical marker here is the Site of Discovery of San Francisco Bay, where the first European explorers saw what is now called San Francisco Bay. It was discovered from land and not by ship because the Golden Gate was always so obscured by fog that the many exploring and trading ships that passed by never saw it.', 'One of my favorite hikes in the entire Bay Area.  Great views of the pacific and airport with lots of different different lengths.  You can spend 45min there or an entire day.', ""This is one of my favorite places. Great workout.  When you get to the top, on a clear day, you can see the Bay Area on one side and the ocean on the other. I love the old Nike missile site too. I feel like I'm on top of the world here. The views are breathtaking and confirm why the SF Bay Area is like none other.  And you have an excellent view of the airplanes taking off and landing at SFO. "", ""I've hiked Sweeney Ridge Trail from both Sneath lane and Skyline College. Both entrances have a steep incline in the beginning (not surprising since you're trying reach to top of the ridge).\n\nTo get there from Sneath Lane, head towards Sneath Lane (depending whether you're coming from North or South) on Highway 5 and once you hit Sneath Lane, turn West into the residential and mountains and keep going until it ends. There will be plenty of parking once you hit the gate. From Sneath Lane entrance, you can expect a concrete road until you hit the top.\n\nFrom Skyline College, as you enter Skyline College on College Drive, turn left at the T-intersection and there will be a parking lot on your left. Park there, but make sure that you see the parking restrictions (you may have to pay). There will be a dirt road at the back of the parking lot lined with trees.\n\nThe view from Sneath Lane is a bit more aesthetic since you'd have a view of the reservoir. The entrance is at the end of Sneath Lane so you can't miss it.\n\nOnce you reach the top, you can see the old missile base. There's also the small monument that marks the place where the San Francisco Bay was discovered by the Portola Expedition.\n\nFurther past the monument, you can continue for miiiiiiles to the other ridges.\n\nNote: There are barely any trees onces you reach the top. Wear a hat and suncreen. Bring water because there are no water sources."", 'This hike is fun and difficult.

Nice weather, no traffic on the way out, stepped on trail at 7:50am. just under 2 hrs to the lake, stopped for many pictures. on the way back took the Emerald Lake turn and finished that way. My device had me at 10.6 miles. Likes the climb out of Barney Lake...', 'I hiked this trail on 9/20/18. Beautiful weather. Not a cloud in the perfectly blue sky. Temperature was around 70 degrees. September is a great month to hike this area. Temperatures are perfect and there are no mosquitos! I hiked this on a Thursday so it wasn’t very crowded. Moderate is a good rating for this trail. Several lakes and running water along the way to filter water. I had weak but usable cellular service (ATT) along several parts of the trail. A plus for those who want to send pictures to friends and family while you’re hiking. Amazing views and beautiful lakes. Definitely a must do trail.', ""We really enjoyed this trail. If you're not in a hurry stop at all the lakes along the way, it's well worth it. We didn't find it too strenuous but we were only packed for a day hike."", 'Moderate is a fair rating for this trail.  Decent inclines but spectacular views. Not too crowded and plenty of water around if you have a filter.', ""Did this hike for the 3rd time. Trail wasn't crowded. It's the first time I've done it without snow on switchbacks. It's my favorite Mammoth hike, safe for solo."", 'Amazing views the entire time your on this trail. Keep your head up though there are horses on this trail.', 'Awesome hike! Hiked this trail on Monday, 8/27/18. Great weather! The views are unreal! Switch backs are a bit tough but well worth it.', 'It was beautiful!! The switch backs were pretty intense.', ""Trail hiked on August 27, 2018, the projected weather for this location was said to be sunny with haze, 64-72 degrees @ 8000 feet of elevation and up. A wind and gust projection of 24 mph with zero rain. I experienced no haze, but the wind and gusts never let up.\nI arrived to the parking loop at approximately 0550 hours with very few vehicles there already. I officially began recording the trek at 0615 hours. The first mile was definitely a heart pumper and warm up for me, the only reason I didn't break a sweat was because my face and hands were frozen from the cool temperature! There seemed to be endless stairs in the first mile to gain some elevation. I was far too consumed in snapping photos that I almost lost track of time and later realized i spent 40 minutes in the first mile. The 2nd mile was a nice break from endless stairs and horse droppings (in part I think the fresh droppings occasionally served a purpose in providing warmth, it was everywhere), if i would have got there any earlier I would have walked through the steam of it! At that early hour I was able to hear a creek, and caught sight of some very jaw dropping lakes- so beautiful! At around the 2.6 mile hiking down into the Barney Lake area, I was very much surprised by a Black Bear as much as I surprised it. Fortunately the bear was trained better than I was- it ran away! I froze and then proceeded to do everything backwards by snapping a photo, recording it and then yelling. I then thought it would be a smart idea as to not disrupt it again and thought tiptoeing through that area was much smarter- NOT!\nHiking into mile number 3, the terrain change was immediate. Everything became rock, unstable footing, caught poles, rolling ankles, and then I was too afraid of running into big horn sheep so I kept making myself dizzy looking everywhere at once. I felt like a bobble head! Mile 3 also consisted of just about all the switchbacks you'll encounter on this trail; the switchbacks were short, rocky and many! As you approach the pass, get ready to see a stunning sight. I personally thought it looked sexy! The different shades of blue in the water, a few white caps, the backdrop of grey and meadows. Dear God it was heaven a very sexy heaven!!!!  At that moment I couldn't wait to get down to the water, but was quickly grounded by the change in terrain again, the trail becomes thin, too thin.  I needed to use a chopping motion with my poles to move the shrubs, and branches out of the way!  The trail literally had me cat walking it was so thin. At approximately mile marker 4.4 don't miss the mine shaft, (i think that's what it is) it's boarded, chained and locked, but I'd love the hear the story on that one! Duck lake is incredibly large, and Pika lake was just too pretty to not take off a few layers and sun bath out there. I dipped in the water and immediately regretted my decisions in life- I thought my heart stopped! I never experienced a nuisance with insects of any kind, if you fish, keep in mind there are fish in those waters! I regret not taking my fishing rod. I truly hope you give this moderate hike a chance to prove to you that even the easier ones are worth your time. This one bumped up to my favorite so far."", 'I did this hike out and back in under 4 hours. My Garmin registered 8 miles. Warning... if you are looking for peace and solitude don’t go on this hike. 8/20/18 Monday was too crowded and noisy. People please keep your voices down...The first 1.5-2 miles are very dusty. The best part about this hike- getting to the Duck pass. It’s challenging and fun.', 'So pretty. Loved all the lakes and creeks you pass along the way. The beginning is a bit strenuous and when you hit the rocks it’s also tough. The views are worth it tho!  A little smoke was coming in so we didn’t stay at Duck Lake for long. But it was nice to put our feet in the water and cool down. On the way back, stopped by the smaller lakes and took our time heading back. Started at 830am and got to the car by 3pm (includes stops for resting) Such a beautiful day and did run into people quite often on the way up and back down. It’s tiring tho. I tracked in my phone over 11miles total. Bring lots of water (or filtration) and snacks.  Bugs weren’t too bad. Although something stung me on the back of my arm but was just a small welt and went away. The shaded parts were nice too.', 'Beautiful hike! Easy+/Moderate. Views are stunning both ways. Hit a thunder and lightening storm, rain and sleet at Duck Lake. Saw horses and dogs on the trail, everyone friendly. Several lakes along the way to have a snack or cool your feet. Many places along the route to filter water. Mosquitos not too bad.', 'One of the best day trail hikes in eastern Sierra', 'Very nice hike!  This is our 2nd time and it was just as pretty as the first.  There is a lot of smoke in the area due to the Lions fire but there was none on this hike, which was a real plus.  The first mile is some work and the switchbacks leading to the top of the pass are challenging but doable. Go on this one, you won’t be disappointed!', 'Went on this hike this past weekend with a few friends and my dog, and the views were just breath taking. I must say this hike was a bit challenging at the beginning and the end, but it is totally worth it. You pass by quite a few lakes and creeks, which could be great for some fishing. We even got to see some deer on our hike up there as well as some beautiful trees and flowers. In total with all the turn-offs we did to see the lakes we hiked 10.6 miles. Make sure if you do go on this hike to start as early as possible and pack lots of water and food!', 'Great day hike.  We walked to the trailhead while camping in Coldwater Creek Campground.  Partially shaded for the first half of the hike.  The switchbacks over the pass to get to Duck Lake is hard, but definitely worth it for the views of Pika and Duck lakes.  Although those switchbacks are tough, I would highly recommend this day hike.  Bring some snacks/food and be sure to have enough water.', 'Beautiful hike in mid July. Quite heavily trafficked but did not detract from the beautiful nature. Worth hiking down to water level of Duck Lake and taking a dip if you don’t mind the cold mountain water! A great moderate hike. Will do it again.', 'Gorgeous trail, saw other hikers but not to busy. No mosquitoes when we were out on 7/27.', 'great trail! gets a little rocky closer to the end, but in all is a trail that can be worked. Finished in about 3.5 hours there and back.', 'It’s not easy, but its also not too strenuous. Gorgeous views are worth it. I did it in about 5 hours, with brief stops for rests or photos. There was ample parking at the trailhead and bathrooms (with flushing toilets and TP!) The first part was nicely shaded and woodsy, but the back half you are pretty exposed as you climb up rocky switchbacks. On a Saturday you won’t be the only one on the trail, but it’s not very crowded — there were spans of time when I didn’t pass by or see anyone for 30 or 40 mins. If you’re into a shorter hike, Skelton Lake is gorgeous and a worthy destination, without as much climbing as you need to do to get to Duck Lake.', 'This was our first hike in the Mammoth Lakes area and we couldn’t be happier we started here. Beautiful trail leading to multiple stunning lakes. Other reviews give a great description of the trail - here’s what we found:\n- Mosquitos were not bad at all (we were expecting much worse given the recent reviews) but somewhat active at beginning of trail. \n- Barney Lake is worth the trail if that’s all you get to (and it’s a fairly easy hike to get there). If you go, hike past Barney and up the switchbacks a bit to get a view back onto the lake and the mountains.\n- We took a right at Duck Lake and walked out about .25 miles - it was enough for us to get a sense of the lake. Round trip about 8 miles which was a perfect first day in the mountains.\n- The trail is popular and includes runners - some were a bit rude and passed us without saying a word. Yes, it’s their trail too but we still found this way of sharing the mountains rude. \n- We returned via the Emerald Trail Lake and highly recommend it. Emerald Lake was beautiful and the trail was a smooth downhill back to the parking lot.\n\nFabulous hike and highly recommended!', 'Great hike ,was a bit challenging but worth it when we got to Duck Lake. Beautiful wildflowers and Thankfully no mosquitos !', 'Great trail if you want to fish away from the crowds.  Incredible views from the ridge above duck lake.  A long day hike but gradual inclines make it doable.  Bugs weren’t that bad but wear the juice for sure.  Not much shade so dress accordingly and bring 3 liters of water or a way to sterilize the creek water.', 'This trail was worth every minute of the 7 hours we spent on it! The views were phenomenal and nothing else compared to the beauty we saw here. The following day I went to Devil’s Postpile and Rainbow falls and found them to be less impressive because I went on this hike the day before. We took beautiful pictures at each of the stops we saw on the trail so if you plan on stopping to take in the sights, it will more than likely take you about 7 hours as well. A word of warning, we went on 7/8/18 and the mosquitos were absolutely terrible even though we were using Off Deep Woods spray. Consider covering up more or using a bug repellent that’s more lotion based.', ""Beautiful views along the string of lakes from the Coldwater Campgrounds at the base of Lake Mary. Great options for overnight permit camping at skeleton lake, Pika lake, duck lake or purple lake! The rocky Duck Pass is long and exposed so best to get here before the heat of midday. The view from the top looking back towards Lake Mary is gorgeous, but as soon as you cross the saddle and drop in to Duck Lake, wow. Totally worth it. Can be done as a day hike or add on for the overnight. Mosquitoes were viscious (typical at this time of year) so don't forget protective clothing or bug spray!"", 'Hiked 7/1/18.Duck Lake Trail is a moderately challenging hike that leads to Arrowhead Lake, Emerald Lake, Skelton Lake, and Duck Lake. The trail is beautiful, quiet, and moderately shaded with several types of wildflowers along the way. Just don’t stand in one place too long, as the mosquitoes are out in full force. We were fully covered but wished we would’ve worn mosquito repellant.', 'Hiked 6/25/18.\n\nThis is a gorgeous hike with amazing views of several lakes and mountain ranges. Great panoramic views start from around Skeleton Lake, but the walk is beautiful before this point. There are a few patches of snow covering the path as you climb towards the saddle just after Barney Lake but these are easily passable. This path is fairly well trafficked to Barney Lake with significantly fewer people after this point. Fairly exposed - bring sunscreen!', 'Duck Lake is one of the most beautiful alpine lakes we’ve ever seen, with bright blue water and surrounding glacier-covered peaks. The views along the way near Barney Lake are also phenomenal. There were a few patches of snow (which were easy to navigate) when we hiked on 6/23/18. Nice views on the stretch to Pika Lake; plan to go to Duck Pass next time.', 'A super scenic hike and there wasn’t too much snow left on the trail.  It’s easily passable but bring dry socks if you’re camping out!', 'Very scenic hike with dramatic alpine scenery. Went yesterday up to the Duck lake pass - the upper part of the hike is sometimes under snow so had to hike around on talus. We were wearing our street shoes and managed to walk around most of the snow. No mosquitoes yet!', 'Just hiked it on 5-20-18 with my dog. There is clear trail for about 1/4 mile if your lucky enough to find that section. After that it’s pretty much snowpack the whole way. Lots of postholing. Snowshoes recommended. Pretty much guessing where the trail was and made plenty wrong turns. Ended up following some ski tracks and made it to Barney. All the lakes were still frozen and made for some gorgeous views. Skelton from above was by far my favorite view. Mid thaw, valley down below, mountains to the right, beautiful! The snow made it tough but well worth the effort. Got to watch some backcountry skiers come down one of the mountains above Barney too. Awesome!', 'Camped overnight at Barney.', 'Hiked this trail early October. Tough fishing at Duck Lake but awesome scenery.', 'Perfect hike. This trail has something for everyone. Great views, bluffs, waterfalls, lakes, you name it.', 'This hike was amazing! We started out at lake Mary hiked to Arrowhead lake, to Skelton lake, to Barney lake, and finally Duck lake. All lakes were beautiful and had some gorgeous views. Every lake offered something different with immense energy all around. The hiking was moderate with some climbing that was pretty steady, but in few places a little steepness. I would not recommend taking kids or elderly on this entire hike because it is long and can be exhausting. The hike is worth it all though. Be sure to check out every lake along the way!!! Happy Trailing!!!!', ""One of the best hikes in Mammoth Lakes. Three beautiful lakes even before getting to Duck Lake, which is exquisite. The final mile or so is a tougher climb over a rocky debris field from the decomposing peaks. You'll likely see patches of snow even late In the summer. There are beautiful views back toward Mammoth Mountain as you climb.  A winner!  The only downer is the horse and mile poop, it seems to be a favorite of Mammoth Stables also."", ""Such beautiful views especially around Duck Lake! One of the more beautiful hikes I've been on. Another bonus is you can drive to the trailhead as opposed to hikes in the valley, which requires you to take the sardine-like shuttle."", ""This is, by far, one of the best hikes/backpacking trips we have taken. We picked this trail because it was pet-friendly and not too far for the dog. We made it to Pika Lake in about 3 hours. There are plenty of places for the dogs to drink out of ponds and streams and lakes. Although it is uphill for most of the way out, it really wasn't that bad. We passed a lot of day hikers with dogs, trail runners and someHorses. There are very few campsights at Duck Lake so we went to Pika Lake about a mile further. There are a lot of sights at Pika Lake, some near the water and some tucked away in the forest just up from the trail."", 'Incredible this is the must do hike in Mammoth Lakes.', 'Beautiful trail! With so much water this year even in September the lake was full, we encountered snow and many water features along the trail!', ""This is one of the most beautiful hikes I've done. We arrived Sunday afternoon so it was moderately busy  on the way up but we hardly saw people on our way back. It took us about 5 1/2-6 hours to complete but that included stopping for rest and photos and then a nice lunch once we reached the pass. There's no shortage of spectacular views along the way but make sure to continue past the first lake and up the rocky, switchbacks for the best view. Bring plenty of water, snacks and bug repellent. The elevation gets to about 10,800 feet so that's something to keep in mind, too."", 'What an incredible hike!  Broke in my new hiking boots on this trail.', 'Go on to Pika and enjoy the solitude!!', 'Amazing trail, very well made. Gets a little crowded simply due to convenient location near mammoth.', '10.5 mile out and back hike.  The elevation gain is moderate most of the way up.  No snow on the trail.  Bring insect repellent as there are mosquitos near the lakes.  Beautiful views and many wildflowers still blooming-columbine, penstemon, paintbrush and more.', 'Pretty awesome & changing views. Up hill maybe st of the way in, but marked well. Gorgeous ending- go up switchback past the lake for best views at end. Tons of mosquitoes in hanging lakes/ponds along trial- bring insect repellent!!', 'I rated this Trail a 4 ONLY because of the mosquitos, going in late July they were so bad I got eaten alive so bring bug spray! Other than that this trail was awesome!', 'Great family hike! A bit tricky to get to the cliff jumping spot because the marsh area is very wet this year, but still made it across.', 'Beautiful trail in Mammoth. We backpacked in on a weekend so the trails were pretty crowded up until Barney lake. Then the ascent up the crest over to Duck Lake was pretty empty. There were only 3 other groups at the lake for the weekend so it felt like you almost had it all to yourself. Water was freezing even that late in the season, but amazing view of the Ansel Adams Wilderness can be found at the dam side of Duck Lake.', ""It's a tough hike especially gong over the pass. Took 5 hours with several brakes. Arrowhead lake and Duck lake are the highlights."", ""check out Ryan Rosario's review below for the first half of this hike. I recommend the fisherman's trail starting at Arrowhead as well. Mammoth Creek is beautiful.From Skelton Lake to the base of the ascention to the pass...Barney Lake...pretty mild. From there to Duck Pass is moderately strenuous. Very rocky. Very gorgeous when you get to the pass. Check out Pike Lake and Duck Lake as well if you have time. Some nice off-trail adventuring. Another popular hike is to attach this to Mammoth Crest via Crystal Lake at Lake George trailhead on  through Deer Lakes ( semi cross-country). I'll be doing that in two days. Review to follow."", 'Not an easy hike for beginners. Hiked all the way to Duck Lake. Took about 6 hours and 8 miles total. There are multiple lakes that you see on the way to Duck Lake. Beautiful view at the end but plan a whole day for this!', 'Nice hike, but we came up emerald trail and descended duck pass.  Skeleton lake is much nicer then arrowhead', 'Arrowhead Lake was beautiful and worth the hike', 'Favorite hike in Mammoth! Great Lakes, great views, great hike!', 'Awesome', ""We took Duck Pass trail to Duck Lake (past Arrowhead) and camped out overnight. This trail does not disappoint. At every turn there was something amazing to view. The first part of the trail is straight up but don't let that stop you. Once you get past that it starts to even out and you get the beautiful sceneries that the Sierra Nevadas promises you. The lakes you pass and the streams you cross make you stop in wonder. If you take the trail up over the pass to Duck Lake you will be rewarded with a deep blue sea of water. Some tips: Bring water it gets hot up there, the mosquitoes are the size of birds spray before you go, wear lots of sunscreen and don't forget your camera! Happy Hiking :)\nRead more about our trip in my blog:\nhttps://lovz2hike.com/2016/06/25/ducklake/"", 'Great trail and good fishing good for all skill levels. Beautiful lake and views are awesome.', ""Done this trail many many times. Sometimes for just a quick jaunt to arrowhead for some fly fishing, and other times on backpacking trips I took Duck Pass to the PCT to Purple Lake. Beautiful, but brutal. Rocky and dangerous in many areas. Pack really light and you'll have fun. The elevation might kick your butt more than anything. Leave no trace, please!"", ""I recommend parking at the trailhead. While the trolley is nice, it is about a mile uphill through the campground to get to the trailhead.\n\nThis is a classic trail for hikers in Mammoth. I only went up the Skelton but it was a lot of fun. At Arrowhead, there is a large waterfall at the northern end, and then take the fisherman's trail along the lake to the southernmost end, where you will find another high, beautiful waterfall. As you hike back to the main trail from the waterfall, there is an abandoned mining hamlet with a cabin, a bunch of metal equipment just laying there, and a guillotine-looking thing. Very interesting finds. Skelton Lake is pretty big and beautiful. I mainly just walked along the west shore and then returned to the campground.\n\nI am not a big fan of the 0.5 miles of the trail closest to the campground because it is endless switchbacks with very high (2 ft?) rock steps etc. It's like being in a neverending labyrinth. The climb in this section is a bit intense but a good workout, and pretty typical of the trails in this area."", ""An absolutely wonderful hike that gets you up into the high country and gives you 3+ lakes.  I did it first thing in the AM and had it all to myself.  The first part is a bit of work as your gaining most of your elevation.  After that it's one beautiful meadow / lake after the other."", 'Great back packing trip..  Head to Barney Lake continue up to the top and over the mountain drop down into the valley to Emerald lake..  Beautiful..', 'This is just part of what is probably my favorite hike to date. It was recommended to us by a local.  We went from Coldwater Creek to Duck Lake and passed some of the most beautiful lakes I have seen. There were still a few pockets of snow in August but the air was warm. I particularly liked this hike for the spectacular views and the ever-changing scenery. The experience is different every mile of the hike so you never get bored. You\'ll likely pass a few people on the trail, but will still get that ""communing with nature"" feeling. I can\'t wait to do this hike again.', 'Duk pass is a local favorite. If you follow the drainage up past arrowhead lake to Skelton lake keeping the creek on you right you will find an old abandoned mine on your right. Keep your eyes open for a large iron wheel marking the mines location. Cut right at the wheel and you will see a large wooden structure and remnants of collapses stone building. You can follow the stone lined trail of the mine up to the main trail just a few yards before Skelton lake.', 'This is only a part of a much longer trail that originates from Coldwater Creek trailhead all the way down to Duck Lake.

I would not take my six year old or my parents on this hike as there are some sketchy water crossings where I saw the old and young losing their balance. I myself almost lost my balance once. There are also a few scary rocky ascent areas where there isn’t a lot to hold onto and the rocks are covered in dirt so they are slippery. I will do this hike again. It’s worth the few scary spots.

You might get your shoes wet crossing the river on the slippery rocks.', ""We visited on the first Wednesday in April. $9 per adult to get in. Sign at the gate indicates no drones, no pets,  no service animals . If you go early on a weekday there is no line up and lots of parking. Trailheads are clearly marked for the most part. Agile people will be able to cross the river using the rocks without getting wet but others should be prepared to get wet. Water is no more than ankle-deep at the crossings and really no more than knee-deep at any spot along the river. Very easy trail. A couple of short inclines but nothing unmanageable. Beautiful scenery. You can't actually get right up to the Seven Sisters waterfall. You can only see it from a distance. It is a trail that is shared with riders on horseback so there is lots of horse manure but it is not unmanageable. A genuine oasis and palm grove in the desert. Highly recommended hike!"", 'The best trail!!! This time of year water is flowing( you will get wet). So much fun!', 'Was a great easy Hike!', 'Great trail... get there early to avoid line getting into the park.  And if you want to get to the end (in March) bring shoes that can get wet. I have tried to post a picture of the deep water crossing and for some reason it does not get posted.', 'Loved it', 'Plenty of water. Footing is not easy.', ""Fun! Lots of water crossings so be prepared to get wet. I have to trying to stay dry and enjoyed myself more this way. Beautiful sights! I'll be back."", 'was great . got wet . made it to the end. . had a great day with friends', ""This is a wonderful trail! It's clearly marked and has a lot of river crossing- my 10 and 6 year olds were able to do the entire hike. I would recommend wearing water shoes if you go in the late winter/early spring because you will probably get wet. I only had a few issues with this hike: 1. You have to pay PER PERSON to get into the reservation. So it was $20 for my 2 kids and I. The hike was definitely worth it, but it was unexpected. 2. The line to get in and pay was very very long. It took us nearly 1/2 an hour waiting in line. The trail was also pretty crowded with people. 3. They do horseback tours through the trail so there is horse poop EVERYWHERE and it smells pretty bad through the first leg of the trail. None of these things are enough to prevent me from going back- the kids LOVED the adventure- but just some things to be aware of."", 'Great hike right now.  There are several stream crossings because of the rains so wear Teva type shoes. First half mile is uneventful but then you walk through a grove of palm trees and streams.   Moderate 4 miles , little elevation', ""beautiful everytime I go up there. be careful you might see a rattle snake or 2 in summer. there's 2 hidden areas that I know about here."", ""One of my favorites, usually pretty quiet when we go (saturday early mornings)...spring time has the most water at the falls and pools...the views are nice, and it's a pretty easy but good work out"", 'Really enjoyed this hike.. the day that I went, there was only a few people on the trail. I passed two ladies on their way down and they said there was no one behind them.. so it was only me up there with a couple guys about half a mile behind me.. wasnt any water due to the time of year, but awesome hike! On the way back down I took a right on another trail that went up to a peak before it went down the other side of the mountain.. only negative on this trail is the horse crap but just watch you step and you will be good!!', 'Nice and hot !', ""It's a great hike. Not too difficult. The creek was wonderful to hear while walking on a hot day."", 'It was a beautiful hike, hot day, so nice to hear running creeks. Quite a few hikers. Would do it again. Very picturesque!', 'Hike was good, moderate workout. But a little over populated.', 'Scenic trail in the desert. The first part of the trail is very exposed. However, once you reach the canyon, you are surrounded by palms trees and towering boulders. You follow along a stream, crossing it repeatedly on slippery rocks. The falls at the end offer a great picture spot.', 'Gorgeous hike along a running river, surrounded by colorful canyons and palm trees. Really mesmerized by the esoteric feeling this canyon brings. $9 to enter the reservation. Worth it.', 'Fantastic hike! Very scenic and not too steep.', 'Very nice moderate hike through the canyon. I love the towering palms surrounding the stream, the boulders and the bushes. There is small waterfalls at the end. Beautiful!', 'This is a scenic easy trail in true desert oasis. Many Palm and wonderful creek. Great rocks and vistas.  Our 2nd time was just as enjoyable as first. You do an entrance fee to get into the Indian reservation.  $9.00 per.', 'I absolutely loved this trail.  The stream was higher than normal due to recent rains, and it was impossible to make the 16 crossings each way without getting my feet wet (or my shins!) but that joust made the hike super-fun.    I would not want to do this hike if it is warmer that 85F.  The waterfall at the end was the perfect spot for some pictures.  Hiking poles are definitely recommended!', 'This is a beautiful place. A true oasis in the desert.', ""Really nice hike. For the first half mile you hike in the open desert before getting into the canyon where you spend the rest of the hike. The entire canyon is a beautiful palm oasis; a small waterfall greets you at the end.  The hike has very little elevation gain. I recommend getting here right at 8am when the park opens to beat the heat. It's too bad it doesn't open earlier. "", ""Gorgeous hike and worth the $$ if you are not from the area. Probably wasn't the best idea to do this at noon on a 90 degree plus day when my pale skin has not seen the light of day since last August (I live in salt lake city), but the palms and jurasic park like scenery was astoundingly beautiful. Oodles of colorful and multi sized lizards!!"", ""First thing to know there is a FEE to get into the hiking area - $9 per adult. This was the only negative we discovered on our outing. \n\nIt had rained the day before so the day was broken clouds, about 70 degrees, and an excellent day for a hike. \n\nTrails were well marked, easy to follow, and a lovely mix of desert and lush, sand and water. \n\nIf it wasn't for the fee I wold be back here hiking every weekend as there are many trails to explore and lots of places for a wonderful picnic and bottle of wine. \n\n"", 'My girlfriend and I did this hike today with another couple. There was lots of water, and the threat of rain throughout the day, but never came. The canyon is very beautiful, well marked and free of any trash. I particularly liked the way the trail crossed over the river many times up to the water falls. This is my favorite hike in the Indian Canyons.', ""Murray Canyon is a stunning hike, but not easy, and I think it is actually about 6 miles round trip. You first must walk through the desert for about a mile or so before you enter into the canyon, so be sure to wear sunscreen and a hat! Once you're in te canyon though, it is pretty shaded. Many dead palm fronds litter the canyon floor, but the trail is clear and the water is beautiful. Not as many people are ever on this trail.There isn't much room at the end of the trail to sit with a large group of people or to have a picnic.  But there are picnic benches at the trail head. Many of the palms do show burn marks, but this is due to a few reasons: there probably was a fire back there a while ago, but also the Native Agua Caliente, Cahuilla people once used fire to manage the land and help with regrowth and the dead underbrush. "", 'Really nice trail. A few crossings over the stream back and forth. The pool at the base of the waterfall was nice and cool, though not very large or deep. Deep enough to cool off in before heading back :) Not much room at the waterfall either, so not ideal to have a picnic lunch there when you reach it. I noticed a lot of the palm trees were burnt along the way. I remember reading somewhere that there was a fire in the canyon caused by some kids. Aside from some of the palm trees being burnt, the canyon is still full of life. You are in the shade half of the time which makes it nice because it gets really hot out there in spring and summer! Bring lots of water.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '',

Pretty steep trail at certain spots but the views from the top are breathtaking! Highly recommend it.', 'Always a pretty hike no matter what the weather or season', 'The trail is clean and well maintained.  The view was worth the work. Trekking poles are strongly recommended for slick downhill portions.', 'Just hiked this trail. Great trail.. The last 1.7 miles is pretty steep climb. Go slow if out shape and you’ll make it to the top of the summit.  Slow will take about 2 hours if you do long trail. Coming down very slippery. Bring poles if inexperienced hiker.', 'Best trail in SLO county. Or at least it’s MY favorite hike. Bottom half has lots of shade. Top half is quite a bit more exposed. The views throughout the hike are marvelous and they get better the higher you go.', 'I love this trail. Not too crowded ever, cool breeze most of the time- incredible views, good, moderately challenging (for someone out of shape) trail.', 'Great view from the top if there is no marine layer! Moderate seems about right. I’m pretty out of shape and it was hard, but my nephew flew up it pretty easy. Can get cold and windy at the top, so might want to have a sweatshirt handy.', 'We hiked this trail yesterday and the wild flowers were in full bloom! It was gorgeous! The view from on top of the peak was definitely worth the climb. This trail would be pretty hot during the summer months, there is a lot of the trail that is in full sun exposure. The trail it’s self was very well maintained. There are bathrooms (non-flushing) at the parking lot at the trail head. I recommend starting the hike on the left trail head not the one to the right with the bridge. It’s longer but a less steep climb to the top. Lots of poison oak in this area so make sure your are comfortable recognizing it! Day use was $10, and the overnight fee was $25.', 'Such a rewarding hike! Amazing view!', 'We did The Cerro Alto loop yesterday taking the long way up and the short path down.  It is a great hike. This trek is not very technical and the trail is really good. I would rate this and Easy/Moderate. It is easy in that, there is nothing difficult to climb through. It’s moderate simply due to the amount of climb. So, go do it. If you are struggling on the climb, take your time. That’s all. You will really love it. The trip down is slippery though. With so much activity the path is broken down a bit to smaller sized pebbles etc. So if you can use some poles, that would help. Bring a lunch and enjoy the top.  Really fun hike.', 'Great hike for one day... moderately steep uphill, with plenty vista points to view Morro Bay from the top ', 'Great wildflowers. Steep at times.  Better than sneakers is preferable. Poles would be good idea unless you are very fit or light on your feet.   Outstanding views from top but very nice views throughout the hike. (Now I have to hike down...)', 'This trail offers a spectacular view once you reach the summit. It also is a fantastic workout and an amazing alternative to stair steppers and elliptical  machines!', 'I love this trail! I took the longer trail to the summit and the shorter one back to the campground. Both are worth seeing, but I preferred the longer route. Both trails are found inside the campground. The longer is further in than the short trail. There is a $10.00 fee that you can pay before the campground right as you turn off of hwy 41 or in the dirt lot at the back of the campground next to the trailhead. It is a fairly steep trail, especially the last 1.2 miles to the top. Be sure to have shoes with decent tread on the way down. The loose gravel and incline combine to make it a bit slippery. This last leg is also very sunny. Bring sunscreen or a hat.', '', 'We parked at the 41 entrance and ran up the boyscout trail which is quite steep. Went through the tower road where it connected to the out and back of the Cerro Alto Loop. Amazing views of Los Osos, Morro Bay and all the peaks. Diablo, Black Hills, etc....Highly recommended!', 'Great trail. Bathrooms at the trail head were discussing. Come prepared.', 'Great cardio workout without the need to run. Terrific views. Good option for preparing or conditioning for a backpacking trip.Only negative is that the trailhead is in a day use fee area so it will cost $10 to hike the 4 mile loop', 'Tough climb but worth the view.', 'beautiful! wonderful hike!', 'Love this trail for its amazing views and rigorous climb.', 'Great hike! Strava said 5.5 miles for the way we went but overall views are awesome and hike is do able!

Took me about an hour and a half to get to the top and an amazing 360 degree view on a clear day from Morro rock to Atascadero area. Trail is marked out well minus a few spots but using common sense you can figure out where you need to go. Make sure you bring 10$ to pay the day fee or 25$ for camping. Ticks, rattlesnakes and mountain lion warnings posted but that's normal for hiking in my opinion."", ""Probably my favorite trail I've had the chance to trek in SLO County. The most challenging physically and only recommended for higher fitness levels, especially if you're planning on hiking up to the peak. I took my bike up to the top and it was pretty savage, but the views are utterly amazing. I could see from Guadalupe all the way to Ragged Point. Easily the greatest ocean view I've ever seen. The ride down was an adrenaline rush to say the least but oh so worth the push up the peak. Lots of cool nature views, creeks, etc. I even saw a horny toed lizard when I was up at the peak, which I did not expect or even knew existed out there. Just an amazing place to hike. Be sure to bring at least $10 with you for parking as the county charges to park"", 'Dont let  sammi review scare u off seems like he or she is inexperienced and out of shape... i have climbed this with a 2 year old on my back.. it is challenging but doable, check weather, better to go on cool day as there is little shade.. take plenty of water.. maybe some trail mix but no need to pack full meal if ur relatively in shape.', 'Went despite the previous reviews- they must not have been very good at hiking. Great well maintained trail and one of the harder ones in the area, and do make it to the top: the views are amazing and worth it if weather is good.

Definitely recommend it', ""I forgot to add something....we get to the lot and these people camping tell us to not go up one of the ways because people keep saying they see a mountain lion up there. I did NOT sign up for fucking MOUNTAIN LIONS. In hindsight, we should've just gone up that way anyways because by the time we were coming back down from the top of this motherfucker I was wishing that a mountain lion would just kill me and put me out of my misery. Watch out for ticks and rattlesnakes too :):):)"", ""What the fuck....this trail is hard and there's no warning that it is a) long and very steep b) slippery as fuck on the way down and c) not marked well. If you aren't an experienced hiker or in decent shape then I wouldn't go on this trail. Make sure to bring a lot of water, Yosemite level water, because it's sunny as fuck and you're going to sweat a lot. Bring food too if you don't want to pass out. Good luck not slipping and falling on all the fucking pebbles on the way down. Bring poles because that helps with that, but you still have to be super careful. We didn't think we were going to make it to the top but then we did and the view wasn't even worth it because it was foggy and the rest of the surroundings looked like we were in goddamn Africa. The view at .25 miles in is literally the same as the top except you don't get to see the foggy ocean. If you want to see the ocean go fucking drive to the beach, not this. Go to Yosemite if you want to hike because it's worth it 1 million times more than this shit."", 'It was beyond amazing! Really nice views.', 'Great hike! Love the views.', ""$10 day pass.

Love it!"", 'Cerro Alto Trail is starts at the Cerro Alto Campground in the Los Padres National Forest about in between Morro Bay and Atascadero on CA-41. The trail is between 4.5 to 6 miles long depending on the starting point. It is a very steep trail, with an elevation gain of about 1650ft. However, the view from the summit, especially on a clear day is absolutely worth it. You can see the California Central Coast from stretching from at least Cayucos to San Louis Obispo with rolling hills in the backdrop. This is one of the few trails in the area which is dog friendly.', ""This is a great, and difficult trail. But the views at the top are worth it. On a clear day you get a perfect view of Morro Bay all the way to San Luis Obispo. This trail is in between Atascadero and Morro Bay on highway 41 (also known as Morro road).

We did the trail at the back end of the campgrounds up to the summit and came back the same way. 5.6 miles I think."", 'moderate hike well groomed trail beautiful views', ""The ascent up to the peak was probably the most challenging hike I've ever taken part of, although I was pushing an 80-pound downhill race bike. Trails were pretty narrow and steep until you get about 3/4 of the way up the mountain. After that it levels off in some spots so you can catch your breathe before making your way to the highest peak or downhill on the other side like I did. The upper elevation changes to desert, which was really neat and I even saw a desert patterned lizard with a spiked crest around its head. No other location matches the panoramic view you get to see when you get up high enough. I could see from Ragged Point to Guadalupe and it's the only peak where you can see all the 7 Sisters Rocks.   The descent was pretty hectic, but oh so exhilarating. I had to change my brake pads after the trip. Lol. All in all an amazing experience and I look forward to a return trip soon. Highly recommended."", ""Pretty Hard trail. 80% of the trail is going straight up, if you don't like steep trails this ones not for you. Well worth it though with the view 2,600 feet up."", 'The views were beautiful. The trail had a very rugged almost high desert feel to it. I happen to go on a very hot day (102 deg.) and there was very limited shade on this hike especially on the way down. Also there was a day use fee of $10, which I did not anticipate, since it is a National Forrest (luckily I had some cash).', 'It was an awesome hike! There were a lot of bugs out there. The beginning of the hike was next to a stream. It was a really pretty area and the views are stunning. Definitely worth it!', 'Great trail, definitely a good workout!', ""Not sure why this trail is labeled as easy - it was pretty intense with the endless uphill hike to the summit to the treacherous steep downhill. Perhaps I'm more out of shape than others as it didn't seem too difficult for my friend who jogs, he and my border collies found this trail easy."", 'There are two trailheads, one at the far back parking area near the bath rooms and one on the right as you drive in, about 800ft from one another.  The one with the bridge over the creek is 1mile to a meeting point.  The other is 1.7 miles to the same spot.  From there it\'s about 2miles to the peak and it really is quite steep.

A steady uphill climb with constant opportunity to take in welcome distractions from the ""work"" with stunning views of the surrounding area, ocean, Morro Rock.  Our Portuguese Water Dog loved it too, especially a stop at the flowing creek at both the beginning and end of the hike.  Definitely worth the hike to go to the summit.

The rewards from above are absolute all around.Although today was pretty hazy it was awesome.', ""This is the kind of hike that leaves you pretty satisfied with yourself after you're done. Elevation change happens very rapidly after you leave the creek, which, despite it being mid-August, had some running water. It was very hot though, so bring one bottle of water per person if you're planning to do this hike in the summer. Spring is probably the best time, when all of the hills seen from the top are green and the plants along the trail don't look so miserable. Still, very rewarding (but a bit challenging)."", ""Oh man this was one good hike ! I'm not going to lie this was a difficult hike for me but worth every second to getting to the top! Beautiful sites to see all the way up . We took our dog on this hike and she loved it. This took us a good 4 hours to hike up and down (we stopped a lot).

I took my 8 and 6 year-olds, who, like little troopers, pushed all the way to the top with me.  A little complaining on the way up, but they loved the top and the view.

Bring plenty of water and a snack.', 'We parked our RV right on the trail head and found a beautifully groomed trail filled with delightful surprises.  The trail crosses the ""bubbling brook"" a couple of times under massive oaks that twist and grow as they will.  The wild lilac perfumed the path.  The forest was alive with animal and bird sounds.  It\'s said that the black sage along the trail can be eaten to disguise the human scent from animals.  (I didn\'t try it.)  Just when you think you\'ll have to fry on the sunny chaparrel-covered slopes, the trail climbs up through moist forest that seems about refrigerator temperature.  The many ferns that line this part of the trail give it a magical feel.  Just after the sign post that says you have 2 miles to go, the trail opens up to the sun, so you need plenty of water...but it\'s worth it to stand on top and view not only the ocean, but the ""9 sisters"" marching along between San Luis Obispo and Morro Bay, including a great view of Morro Rock itself.  These morros are volcanic necks...all that remain of once active volcanoes that were drug away from their birth place in Mexico by the San Andreas fault to their present location.  I returned to camp by the same path instead of finishing the loop, and encountered along the way a girl on a horse, 3 mountain bikers, and then a young couple with two children who were fascinated by the small stream the trail follows.  Other than that, I was alone...on a weekend.  The next day I started up from the other end of the loop, which is found not far down the road from the top of the campground.  It crosses a bridge and seemed just as inviting as the part of the loop I\'d hiked.

It is a well worn trail that are shared with mountain bikers, hikers and trail runners. I would say it is a good trail for most, there were some seniors and children on the trail, so use your best judgment. There are several different trails that can be taken, I was on the one marked “Bernardo Mountain Summit” which takes you to rattlesnake view point. If you are going in the summer or hot in general, start early mornings to avoid heat issues, not a lot of shaded areas and in the summer Escondido gets well over 90 degs, so hotter on the mountain.

Weather was perfect high 70's to low 80's."", ""Morning hike with family. Beautiful hike. My only complaint would be the road bikes that are very quiet coming up behind you. It's hard to move out of the way if your engaged in conversation and don't hear them coming.  There's no need to be rude about it either, we didn't hear you jack knife. Mountain bikes were louder and more courteous, perhaps the mountain bike riders are familiar with walking a trail as well as riding it, so they get the dilemma."", 'A good workout. real suburban.', 'It was a decent hike', 'Excellent hike with panoramic view at the very top you can see the ocean in the distance on a clear day with the lakes and mountains nearby.

Great views from the top of the ocean, mountains, and all of San Diego County!  Definitely going back!', ""This trail had some good variety. It starts off deceivingly easy on mostly flat trails until the last third where it's a bit more rocky and steep. From this starting point you get a mixture of paved, dirt, and rocky paths. You cross a little stream which was cool and have a few pretty lake views along the way and at the top. Excited to check out some of the other trails in this area!"", 'Beatiful views at sunset.', 'I have hiked Coast to Crest a few times before, as I have just started hiking a few months ago. I finally decided to try this trail and I was surprised at how long it was and how I would think I was at the top but I still had like 5 more inclined switch backs. As a overweight gal just starting to do moderate hikes, this one was interesting. But once I got to the top, it was worth it.', ""I hiked this peak 20 years ago and decided to do it again. I'm so glad that I did! Great moderate hike. I even took my pup who did great, but got a little tired coming down the hill. So I took it easy on the way back down. Bring water and plan for a few hours. Great training hike!"", 'Nice hike, good workout and views without traveling too dar to do it.', 'I did this hike today from the parking lot at the end of Sunset Drive and it was 8.2 miles. Great long hike, very easy, with only a few moderate spots. I really appreciated this app today because it helped me find my way on a few spots that were not marked well. Will definitely do again but would not take this hike again at sunset because the view on the way up was nice but dark and long on the way back. Also there were only a few other hikers on the summit portion so that was nice.', 'Nice training hike. Started off at about 0700 with a 30 pound pack. I was able to complete this hike in 2 hrs 27 min and had 7.76 as the mileage (did not include about a 30 minute break at the top). There were lots of options to make this hike shorter or longer and plenty of people on the trail. Mostly bikers and some trail runners. I noticed at the San Dieguito Park there were other trails that head off into other directions and offer different challenges. I will certainly come back any try these trails as well. All of them are a part of the Coast to Crest Trail.', 'Was a nice hike with some challenges and some easy spots.

Thought it might be too easy at the beginning but half way through it was a good challenge.  Would recommend this anytime.  Take your dog with you.  Cooper loved it too.', 'Great workout, you get a good little view, nothing spectacular but nevertheless a great hike. Coming back down goes by much quicker than going up. Does not feel like over 7 miles at all though. Watch out for mountain bikers :)', 'This review pertains to the entire hike from San Dieguito River Park off Via Rancho Parkway to the top of Bernardo Mountain and back. Total distance was just under 8 miles, and bear in mind I did this in mid-December when the weather is cool even at midday.    For starters: the San Dieguito River Park Rangers are pretty awesome.  I got into a long conversation with Brian, a Ranger before I set out and he explained the entire breadth of the watershed especially the Coast to Crest Trail and how far along the SDRP had come in establishing the trail officially.  He was even able help me identify the un-named yet beflagged peninsula that juts out into the Lake Hodges Reservoir (It\'s Fletcher Point, or Flag point colloquially).  Anyway, hats off to the Rangers, and Brian especially.   The hike itself is typical San Diego: hilly, shrubby, boulder-y, you get my drift. Passing under the 15 was interesting but unspectacular.  I do reccomend veering off trail about a mile and a half in to peruse the work of Escondido\'s local graffiti artists.  An embankment with a grey boulder of immense size can be seen from the trail against the edge of a neighborhood.  The grey boulder has been utterly destroyed, no doubt by the community developer many years ago. The pit is now filled with a rusty bicycle and shards of hundreds of beer bottles, all of which is surrounded by fairly extravagant graffiti.  They\'ve been using alot more than just spraypaint here.  Take some time and take a look.   If that kind of thing bothers you, ask yourself who\'s done more damage; the developer or the beer guzzling artisits?    Moving up the trail a small bridge erected by ""Team Trailbuilders"" will take you over an absolutely lovely little creek to the Bernardo Summitt Trailhead.  As you follow the north side of the mountain keep an eye out below, as that creek\'s source is in full view most of the way.  It\'s an exceptionally pretty valley with tall Palm and Eucalyptus trees, and I believe it houses multiple murders of crows, at least it seemed to on my way down.    Bernardo Mountain will not be necessarily easy.  I reccomend bringing trekking poles to make sure you don\'t slip on the way back down, but most hikers won\'t need them.  The peak itself has great views of Lake Hodges all the way out to the ocean, and during the summer would be an incredible spot to watch the sunset.  I\'m giving it 5 stars because it includes so much and because of the SDRP Rangers.  Don\'t miss this hike. It\'s worth it. Happy Hiking', 'nice diverse terrain and nice gain, but too narrow for mixed trail.', 'Nice view, not crowded. Road runners, quails, rattlers, and even deer sometimes by the freeway.', 'Not great views (though the lake is nice) and not great conditions, but a good place to get out and cover some miles for training.  Consider adding some distance by parking at Rancho Bernardo community park south of the lake and hiking across the foot/bike bridge.', ""Strange trail.  Park next to highway, walk on pavement for about a mile.   Then dirt road for another mile and then get to trailhead.  once on trailhead the hike is nice, not much shade at all, just FYI.   The last mile or so to summit is steep and rocky but I kind of like that.   Only 3 stars because of how odd it is.   Lots of mountain bikers today that don't obey the speed limits set and think they have the right of way, they don't.   It was over 8 miles RT from the parking area so the 7.2 must be somewhere starting near the suspension bridge.   Overall, the views from the top are very nice and don't forget to sign the sheet in the ammo box at the top.   I always like that touch."", ""This place is  great for mountain biking. If you ride to the dam it's amazing. Don't ride after dark. You will more than liking get ticketed.  Been on thsee trails plenty of times. Yes bring plenty of water, binos or/camera. Moderate decent for family trips and beginners."", ""First and foremost, bring bug spray and a large stick.  There are several slithery and buzzy critters that roam about.  With that being said, this trail is no doubt moderate but nonetheless still challenging.  I say this because it gets steep for a good portion of the hike and is very jagged, so bring thick soled shoes.  I wore Vibrams.  It also doesn't help that I wore a 35 pound rucksack.  Regardless, the view at the top is rewarding, but I definitely wouldn't go at noon.  It's a good hike but be mindful that the trail can be very brushy for a long period, lots of vegetation so watch for snakes and such.  A really nice thing about this trail is not many people are on it, so if you want some solitude, this is your best bet.  The walk from the parking lot to the trailhead is long and boring, so be prepared for that.  I liked this hike!"", 'Recommend going on a Sunday morning so you can enjoy the farmers market when your done.', ""Way less crowded than Woodson or Iron. Have to walk on pavement and dirt roads a couple miles, pretty flat terrain, until you finally get to the trailhead that leads to the summit. From there it has some steep sections, and although I didn't bring my trekking pole, it wasn't a problem."", ""Odd beginning but once you hit the actual trail I like it a lot. Great view from the top if you catch sunset, just head back when there's enough light."", 'Went with my hiking group again today,  nice work out. this is our 6th visit I think, great cool weather and not too crowded at 8 :00 am.  Views are always  great,  and now crowds today.', ""I'm not sure how, but I went the wrong way twice. I had the hardest time actually finding the trailhead to the summit. The sign faces west, so if you're coming from the east it's easy to miss. There are a lot of bikers too, so be prepared to share the road. If you just want to get out and move and be outside it a decent hike; not very challenging thou."", 'Nice hike.  Once off the main trail and wrapping around the mountain you can find some solitude.', 'My new favorite run! Just the right difficulty - challenging but runable all the way. I went up Sunday morning with my  10 and 12 year old grandkids,and everyone was able to run to the top without walking.\nThey loved the log book. It was there first time logging a summit. If you are a trail runner, it is harder than Ramona dam,but easier than Woodson. Great views and nice single track.', 'Great hike with a variety of views and terrain.  Parts of the trail are fairly steep and/or have loose rocks.  Feels like a real hike without having to drive too far (for us anyway!).  Recommend hitting the trail early to avoid the midday heat.', ""Fantastic views at the top.  Gets very hot in the summer so hike early.   Lots of rocks so I'd recommend hiking boots."", ""Pretty good little hike. It can get pretty crowded depending on the day. Usually there are a lot of mountain bikers as well. There is some shade but I wouldn't depend on it. At the top of the peak is a Folgers can with little notes that people put in there and a pretty good view of Lake Hodges."", ""One of my favorite local San Diego hikes.  Nice elevation gain so you can get a good workout if you want or just take it slow.  Beautiful views from the summit.  Trail is rocky in sections so watch your footing if you're moving fast down hill.  Little crowded the first mile then once the trail narrows you lose most mountain bikers.  During the week you can have the trail to yourself."", ""My husband and I did this hike this past Sunday morning.  Finding the trailhead was a little confusing for us at first because it looked like we ended up at a golf course. After a few minutes of driving around we finally found the small parking lot right next to the trail.  The beginning of the hike is paved and goes directly under the freeway before getting to the actual Bernardo Mountain summit trail.  There were lots of people out, especially mountain bikers.  Before the trail gets very steep or technical for the bikers, expect some traffic from other people of all activity levels.  Since the trail is in such a densely populated area you will never really feel like you are out on a hike away from everything. I still enjoyed the hike because it was a new place for us to explore, but I cant say that I would go back and do it again.  if you plan on biking to the summit (we only saw one rider go all the way to the top) be ready for some technical spots. I am not a mountain biking enthusiast, but it looks pretty tricky in parts especially where there are washouts.On another note, I understand that parts of the trail are wide, but I always prefer when riders ring a bell or announced that they are coming up behind us.  Most riders on this trail don't do that, but I always appreciated the few that did."", ""Unexpectedly great hike!  Didn't know if I was going the right way until about a mile in when there was a sign for Bernardo Mtn on a trail that veered off to the right.  Went a couple hours before sundown and I couldn't have planned it better if I tried!  Amazing views from the top & a pretty good work out too."", ""I really enjoyed this hike. I went on a Saturday morning, the temperature was cool which made it easier to hike. The path is clear, but there is over-grown brush, so be careful of poison oak and you'll see the warning sign right as you pass the creek. There is incline with flat surfaces off and on throughout the trail, which makes it easy to want to jog the flat part of the trail and walk the incline parts. Bring water and I wouldn't recommend this hike in the Summer as there is hardly any shade. When you get to the top, you will see some of the most beautiful views of Escondido. Lake Hodges, surrounding mountains, the ocean, and most of the city. Enjoy!!!"", ""it was a good hike. the trees were a good break from the heat. you get a view of the freeway and the houses.  they have farmer's market on sundays. i like how it wasn't crowded at all and it was a good length with a steady elevation."", 'Bernardo Mountain is a good mellow trail for anyone who wants to do some distance but not have a huge incline. The trail takes a mellow path from the trailhead on the other side of the freeway around the lake and around the mountain. The trail for the most part is pretty well maintained and would easily work for mountain bikers as well as hikers.', ""The only bad part of this trail is starting and ending right next to the freeway.  Once you get past the freeway and start going up the mountain it is great.  The climb to the top of Bernardo Peak is a great workout and the views of the lake are awesome.  There is a bathroom located near the foot bridge going across the lake but you must bring plenty of water.  Most people bypass the trail leading to the peak so it won't be crowded like Iron Mountain or Mt. Woodson.

While the ascent trail is a promising single track, about the time you complete the ascent and the 405-size crowds die out, the trail becomes a flattish fire road. From then on, the trail is devoid of anything interesting besides the views over the Pacific.a good workout, but will not repeat.', 'One of my favorite hikes either from the ocean side via sunset blvd or the valley side via Topanga State Park.... end views are awesome try going after rain for clearer sky’s and less people', 'Amazing views throughout and wide, well kept trails.', 'We started early at 6:45 AM and noticed a lot of cars park already. Coming from Los Leones Canyon entrance trail, it is 1.5 miles of narrow and relaxing hike with trail covered with trees. Then  you will be exposed to open overlooking views of ocean and city and there is a bench for resting. Then the rest of your 2 mile trail to the Parker Mesa overlook will be wide and exposed  with few inclines that will give you your cardio workout. The overlook is amazing and breathtaking on a clear day.', 'Very nice and clean trail. It was an easy trail, very little inclines. About 6.8 miles back and fourth trail. Connects to los Leones trail and got to see that beautiful ocean view. Hiked Labor Day 2018 at 12 pm, very little traffic. Perfect running trail for the way down.', 'Beautiful view', 'This was one of the more scenic hikes I’ve done in LA. The views (on a clear day) are amazing and once you hit the peak you get a nice [reward] panoramic view of the shoreline and cityscape. I clocked in 7 miles from start to finish on this one.  I would rate this as an easy to moderate hike. It’s an incline for most of the way up (not TOO steep but does give you a workout) but there are many parts of level ground. What makes it a bit more strenuous is the distance. The trail is exposed so bring hats, wear sunscreen and bring water. I went around 2pm and ran into hikers/bikers maybe every quarter mile or so, not too busy. Saw people coming up to the overlook point from different trails so assuming many other trails lead to this peak.', '', 'Great trail, beautiful views! Would put this towards more moderate but well worth it. We got there early, 8.30am Saturday morning and were only a couple of other people around. Got a lot busier on the way back around 11am.', 'One of my favorite hikes in L.A. if you want to make this hike more challenging, there is an alternate route that will turn this into a 5 mile loop. From the main entrance on los liones, go left and down to cross the concrete. Follow the trail and about 50 meters in you will see another trail on your left that goes up the steep hillside. From there it is 1.4 miles to parker mesa overlook but be warned it is quite steep.  You will gain 1300 feet in 1.4 miles, expect to cover this distance in 45 minutes to an hour depending on how many breaks you take. Shoes with good traction are recommended. I take this way up and the regular easy way down to make it a loop, going back this way is not recommended as it is quite steep.', ""A moderate hike, mostly uphill. Try to start in the afternoon after the fog is lifted otherwise you won't get much of a view."", 'Beautiful views, I would do this trail again.', 'Amazing hike, great views, and fun.', 'One of my favorite LA hikes; nice views and a good workout.', 'The views are fantastic!! Good calorie burner too', 'This is a moderately difficult hike. Steep up hill and down.   Beautiful views are your reward.', 'Beautiful scenery', 'Easy trail open spaces and you are not too exposed.', ""It isn't really easy...more like moderate in my opinion...1,300 ft of elevation gain after all."", ""My favorite trail in LA!

Last time I hiked it was 3/19 and when I got to the top the entire ocean view was covered in clouds so it looked like I was on top of the clouds! I started late and got back to the parking lot later than I wanted to. The whole trail is about 6 miles and pretty easy but there's some incline so allow yourself a few hours. Parking is available on the street before you enter the park so you don't have to pay."", 'i was scrolling through the list, looking for a new trail, when I saw that this one was labeled easy.  Having done it several times, I didnt recall it being that easy so I did it again.  It is easy if you hike a lot but given that it is 6 miles RT, about half of which is without shade, and that there are significant ascents and descents, I would rate it as moderate.  It is certainly easier than coming up the other side to Parker Mesa but not a walk in the park.  :-)', 'Great views', ""This is one of my favorite trails in LA. Part of it is on fire roads so it's not like being in the backwoods but it's a good incline and one of my favorite views of LA."", 'I love this trail!!! The views are amazing!', 'Love this hike.

Glad I started early! would not consider this easy as a biking trail - my computer calculated total elevation climbed of 1401 ft.

Great ocean view once high enough. Lots of people to interact with, or not; but they were courteous. Mountain Bikers + a few kids spotted. Definitely bring water if going to tackle Parker Mesa Overlook Trail. It can kick butt if not prepared', ""This is a really great hike. It isn't too hard. Has some beautiful scenery, clear trail markings, and a great destination"", 'This was just ok.  Started at Los Liones.  Unfortunately, really no shade so that made the climb arduous.  Clouds rolled in and it made the rest of the hike super easy.  Nothing remarkable to see except when you reach the overlook.  On way back, near to bottom was busy with super slow walkers.  Did this hike in record time and felt it was boring.', ""Don't do this hike in the summer... 20% shade... Started from Topanga State Park... Bring lots of water... Very dog friendly if the State Park allows it... But the view from the top is breath-taking!!! If doing this in summer START EARLY!! Before 7am!!"", 'Flew all the way down from Seattle for this hike!  Actually was in town for business in Chatsworth and this looked perfect!  Great view and perfect distance!  Not easy by any means, but not hard. Bring Water!', ""I was shocked to see this trail rated easy.  And then I saw that most enter the trail off of Topanga Cyn.  We entered it from Los Liones Canyon (off of Sunset Blvd.).  3.5 miles in and 3.5 miles out.  But the kicker is that it's 3.5 miles straight up.  Started at 10:30am (bad move....maximum heat time) and only made it 2.5 miles in (????).  I usually enjoy 8+ mile hikes.  Will definitely be back and climb my 3.5 miles straight up to earn the awesome view everyone is talking about (even though the views along the way were not too shabby)."", 'great views, good one if you like populated trails.', ""The hike is on a fire road, so if you're not a fan of fire road hiking, I'd recommend using a different trail to get to the overlook. Make sure to start your hike early because there's very little shade--we started at 11 and finished at 2--the worst possible time for this particular trail. The view at the overlook is very nice. Make sure to pack a lunch and allott yourself enough time to sit and enjoy the breeze, especially if you've hiked out on a hot day! The trail is very up and down, so it won't cut you much slack in either direction, but the overlook is worth it."", ""The trail head is inside Topanga Canyon Park - find parking outside on Waveview Drive and walk into the park and save yourself ten bucks. The trail head is easy enough to find - the trails pretty wide and pretty friendly for runners and bikers. Arrive early because there isn't too much shade unfortunately on the trail itself, and it started to get pretty sunny and hot around 10 am on my run. The run toward Parker Mesa Overlook (3 miles each way, out and back) changes incline quite frequently, making it a challenging, but not too gruesome run."", ""Great, hike. The weather was a pleasant 75 degrees with a slight Marine Layer coming in from the sea. Plenty of uphills and some down and the scenery when you reach the Overlook can take your breath away. Great day to spend with God and Fellowship with some Disciples. After the hike we went to Denny's and broke bread together. Great start to a beautiful weekend. I'll add that if you continue on Entrada Road where a tri-section of Wave View Drive, Entrada Rd, and Colina Drive. You can park in this area for free but be early."", 'My son and I hiked the Parker Mesa Overlook last Sunday. Luckily we left our dog at home as there are no dogs allowed on this trail. More of a long walk than hike, we did not see a lot of wildlife, but there are several overlooks that are somewhat inspiring, the first one of Topanga Canyon Blvd. below. However, if you go to the end of the trail the trek is well worth it... Incredible views of the Pacific Coastline all the way up to Santa Monica and you can also see Downtown L.A. from the same vista point. There are a lot of people on this trail. All in all a good time to chat, but not that interesting until the end. We made it at a moderate pace in 2 - 1/2 hours.  There is a trail that veers off towards the end that goes down to the beach. ', 'short nice leisure pays off Santa Monica coastal view at the top', ""Phenomenal views! If you are rusty mountain biking then I recommend turning back to the parking lot after viewing the overlook. If you continue to the gate you get good solid downhill ride, weaving through hikers the whole way, but that means you have a consistent 1.5 mile uphill back to the overlook.  If I were to do it again I'd have a car waiting at the gate to take us back to the first car parked at the parking lot."", '7am start time.  Fun ride from Entrada to Parker Mesa.  2hrs total just chillin.  Lots of up hills and lots of downhills there and on the way back.', 'The views from various points on the fire road are fantastic but the over hiking experience is average. Outside of the view points, the single track approach trail from Los Liones is the nicest part of the hike. ', 'This was my second time hiking in Topanga State Park. Previously, I did the Eagle Rock trail and decided I wanted to get closer to the ocean this time. I started a little after 8am on a day that was supposed to peak at 90 degrees around noon. Needless to say, I was on a race to finish the entire trail before my skin melted off. It was really beautiful in the early morning because there was plenty of shade on the trails. However, on the way back it was quite brutal because rising run eliminating any shade. I had a hat which helped, but there\'s nothing you can do to escape the hot sun. It\'s definitely a motivator though.  \n\nWhen I finally reached the overlook, it was definitely beautiful but the seating capacity up there is just limited to two benches. This means that you don\'t have too much time to ""soak in the view"" and eating a snack might have to be done on a rock (like I did). I\'d recommend arriving earlier to hopefully avoid the crowds. At the end of the trail, I was glad to have conquered this trail. There were plenty of ""rest moments"" when the road was somewhat flat, but the occasional incline did kick my butt momentarily. I would recommend this to someone who wants to see a variety of ocean views throughout L.A.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '',

We looped with the Jones Bar trail and it was a blast. Not very kid friendly over on the Jones bar  part because of steep terrain but still a good trail to hike.', 'Awesome family hike and very flat. Little chilly as most of the trail is shaded.', 'Forested, shady, level and incredible views. We took this hike this year around Christmas. The trees were damp with dew, and the sun was peeking through the fog, highlighting the South Yuba River Canyon. The forest is a mixture of Ponderosa, Digger, and other conifers, along with California Oak, Madrone and Manzanita. The best part of this trail is the bridges. The wooden walkways provide good photo spots and break up the trail length. Don’t be fooled by the mountainous topography. This trail is almost 100% level. Flat. In fact, we heard it was one of the first wheelchair accessible dirt trails constructed in the USA back in the 70s. It follows an irrigation ditch built by the Chinese in the 1800s. Now used as a hiking path. At times, we switched from the top to the bottom of the ditch. Consider the unique canyon boardwalk as the destination. Making it about an hour round-trip walk. Great for groups, or anyone looking for a level start. Bring high-soled shoes and trekking poles if you plan to hike in the winter, as the ditch can be muddy in some spots. - Mike and Angel Cutler, EarthTrek Gear', 'nice relaxing trail. I love going in the fall with the amazing color changes of the trees and salamanders every where.', 'I really enjoyed this hike! Ground was level and beautiful views and ran into some salamanders on the trail. Will definitely do it again!', ""The trail itself is beautiful, and though I would not describe the views as spectacular, the jaunt itself is pleasant and relaxing. I took the trail from the (very low) underpass to the right of the trailhead sign all the way to it's finish at the fire road (there is an end of trail marker there to let you know). A little anticlimactic since there was no sweeping view at the end. When I do it again, i will likely stop at the picnic tables located after the bridge. Great place to snack and recharge before heading back."", 'Great trail! lots of mosquitoes though. Easy walk, level and shaded.', 'this is a fantastic trail to take young kids who are just starting to get into nature walks without being in a stroller. it is long but easy for them to enjoy and explore. the trail has several little creekbeds that are filled with salamanders. the walk bridgws and paths are also nice for individuals who have difficulty walking. bridges have benches and great views.', 'This trail is more a walking trail rather than a hiking trail. It’s very flat, mostly shaded, and provides a pretty nice view of the South Yuba river from above. It’s not a crowded trail since more people opt to spend time down by the river. The wooden bridges were a nice touch as well. From what I saw, it’s an in-out trail. The only drawback was having to avoid dog poop which was not moved from the trail.', 'It was a very relaxing trail to hike.  sad that part of it was damaged.', 'great for kids path is well maintained. a lot of people there so made it tricky for the narrow path', ""The scenery on this trail is ever changing! Which made it interesting and fun:) It wasn't challenging in any way, very chill. Adorable, really. Good for everyone! Adults and kids. Wheelchairs not so much)."", 'Was a great little trail. We had it all to ourselves.This would be a great walk for young children as well.We had an illusion that we were walking slightly down hill both ways ', 'the west trail is actually a loop of you take Jones bar and hike on the service road for a bit.  you will see where the west trail meets the road.  Take that back to the trail head.  Very nice and shady. The most  difficult part was the incline on  the service road. we then went to to the east trail.  This is an in and out trail.  Easy and flat.', 'We weren’t impressed. This is an in and out hike, which we knew to begin with. The hike halfway in was nice and very easy. It was also wide enough and very level for wheel chair accessibility. The wooden switchback was blocked off and deemed unsafe. We were able to navigate our way down but definitely not accessible in a wheelchair. It was the only point on the hike that any water was visible. The second half of the way in was level and very easy for an able person. The trail narrowed to the point that a wheel chair would not fit and tons of poison oak encroached the path. There was also two fallen trees blocking the path. The trail led to an end of trail marker...a huge disappointment for myself and my two teen boys. Apparently, in other reviews, we could have crossed what appeared to be a county maintained gravel road and scaled down some boulders to a swim pond. Didn’t realize that until later. We headed back and then drove down the hill to the bridge where we joined several others at the swimming hole. Lots of fun there. Next time, that’s where we will spend our time.', 'I am in a wheelchair (power) and this was amazing!!', 'Just wanted to clarify that following the dirt road to the right at the end of the trail leads to an absolutely beautiful spot but the loop back to the trail is a very tough vertical hike. You will find it on the other side of a wooden foot bridge.', 'so much beauty', 'Easy hike. Bring bug spray and watch for poison oak. It’s everywhere. We were a little confused about .5 miles into hike there was a trail that leads down. Jones Bar. We took it and realized a mile in that we were off the trail and had to turn around. So stay on the upper trail.', 'It\'s a very easy walk for strollers, well-behaved pets, and well-behaved 4-year-olds... but it\'s too easy to be a real ""hike"". I absolutely love that it\'s wheelchair accessible, and I saw a young lady out enjoying her outing with seemingly no problems. The view is amazing with beautiful flora!! The trail is clean and very well groomed with picnic tables and benches, but long pants are advised as Poison Oak grows in abundance near (and onto!) the pathway. Some areas can get hot where the breeze just doesn\'t reach.', 'Nice botany hike with my CNPS  colleagues. A lot of cool plants along the this little snippet of trail. I want to go back and hike some other areas, soon. Although I will be looking at plants, I can get more miles in with a smaller group.', 'Too easy for a hike but definitely a breath taking beautiful nature walk. Oh I forgot the mosquito repellent and was bit many times so don’t forget yours.', 'beautiful hike!  i knew better then to leave the house without bug spray(lesson learned). There is many mosquitoes and a ton of poison oak . it was so nice overall and i will be going again forsure. very easy hike', 'Amazing', 'beautiful easy trail with good accessibility.', 'Nice walk - nothing difficult. Not well marked at the end so tough to get down to the river. We ended up using a “trail” that required we navigate some big boulders (and lots of poison oak) but in the end it was all worth it', 'Great, easy hike with great views. We didn’t know you can make a loop and go down to the river. We went to the end of the trail and turned around and went back the way we came, so I would suggest that if you want to get to the river turn right at end end of the trail and follow the dirt road. All in all a really great hike.', 'The trail was awesome, easily accessible, and beautiful! The weather was perfect and the trail is full of many shady spots along the way to let the dogs take a rest and drink! The only reason the trail didn’t get 5 stars is due to the fact that there were massive amounts of poison oak growing alongside the trail, mosquitos (shady, moist, and warm, we should have known lol), and water access was not possible with the dogs...the descent was too steep. If you can handle the cons then the trail is MOST DEFINITELY worth the pros!', 'Great trail for your dogs, beautiful butterflies 曆.

', 'As trails go this one is easy. It may be the only wheelchair access trail in the US. On a nearly flat grade it follows an old miners flume used as a water supply for hydraulic mining during Californias gold rush. For a mile and a half westerly from the trailhead (about 5.5 miles north of Nevada City on State Highway 49) the trail crosses creeks and canyons on timber bridges and trestles. A lot of carpentry work went into restoring these old timber flumes. The crossing of Rush Creek canyon is particularly impressive with its long curving timber trestle that at one point branches onto a series of switchbacks down to the edge of Rush Creek where, at this time of year, there is a fine display of white waterfalls spilling into green pools. About half way to the falls a sheltered platform with benches affords a view looking into and across the South Fork of the Yuba River.\nOn this particular day a fourth grade class from a Grass Valley charter school had scheduled a field trip. Out of sight ahead of us they moved along the trail like a flock of sparrows, inquisitive but well behaved, laughing and giggling all the way. We continued past the point where the trail branches, because the children were down below standing in groups waiting for a turn see the green pools and maybe throw a rock in the churning water (at least the boys).\nJust around the bend we found two picnic tables and an outhouse. While we ate our lunch, the fourth graders, all 24 of them, accompanied by their teachers paid a visit to the outhouse. It seems like kids like to visit strange bathroom in restaurants and other places. It comes from their curiosity.\nIn the month of May some wild flowers were blooming, notably iris, globe lilies lupine and Indian paint. Some of the plants are labeled with neatly typed white tags, no doubt prepared by a botanist, because the Latin name is also printed though often unpronounceable. Even some trees are tagged. We were happy to learn that the ponderosa pines were indeed ponderosa and not Jeffrey. If I recall correctly the pitch of Jeffrey pines have that peculiar vanilla odor and their cones are larger than the ponderosa. The labeling is a nice educational touch and a refresher for those of us with aging memories. \nThe westerly piece of the Independence Trail can be turned into a 4.3 mile loop (not suitable for wheelchairs) by continuing on to Jones Bar Road. The shorter option is to retrace your steps about 1.1 miles back to the trailhead.\nIf you want to go the other direction you can walk but you cant drivea wheel chair. An easterly segment of the Independence Trail goes from the trailhead for 2.5 mile. However, the trail is blocked by an uprooted tree and large boulders, so wheel chairs cant make it past this point which is not far from the trailhead, although hikers can easily make it around the blockage.\nA round trip to the falls at a leisurely pace takes a couple of hours. Pushing a wheelchair may take longer.\n', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '',

At the trail junctions, there are helpful little signs to help you get oriented.', 'Loved this trail. All trail mapping is fantastic. So many times I could got lost.', 'Pretty busy. If you start on the north side the incline is very intense and long: my kids were not pleased (4/6) and had to be carried. Trail shoots up then drops down to a flat valley with lots of blooming poison oak right along the trail. State park should remove or control it (it’s everywhere).', 'Nice family hike.The most difficult part is crossing through Poles trail, which is a steep incline of just under half a mile.  I would definitely recommend doing the trail counterclockwise, which would mean taking the incline uphill, but will give you a beautiful ocean view the rest of the way.  Well worth the climb.', 'I\'m not sure who decides the difficulty level for these trails, but I felt like this was on the higher side of ""moderate"".We parked in at Visitor\'s Center.  You have to pay for parking - $5/hour or $15/day, but they don\'t let you pay hourly on the weekends.Since it\'s a loop, you can do this trail two ways.  We headed South from the Visitor Center to the El Moro Canyon Trail, followed that up the canyon to where it meets Poles and Jeep Trails.  This part of the hike was relatively easy, with a slight incline.  The Poles Trail is short but STEEP... most people were coming down.  Be sure to have a good tread on your footwear if you decided to hike down. At the top of Poles you make a left and head back down to the Visitor Center parking.  The view of the ocean is really nice on the way down, which makes the trek up Poles worth it.', 'Nice hike on a well maintained trail. As expected, no shade on the hike so bring plenty of water. If you go to the right on the trail you stay almost flat for about 1.5 miles til you reach the very steep incline to get to the ridge. If you go to the left the incline is gradual but then you don’t get the view of the water while hiking.', ""My 9 year old son and I did this hike. I'm glad we brought our hiking sticks. Some parts were a little steep him, but he did it! We enjoyed it & he would like to do it again with his cub scout pack. The view was great!"", 'Nice hike. Strenuous uphill climbs in the beginnings, but nice views of the ocean once you reach a hilltop. Bring shade and plenty of H2O.', 'beautiful view.', 'This was my first time hiking in a while. I found it a little challenging once we reached the steep incline. Had some nice views and the weather was great! Would recommend.', 'Starts off a nice walk then gets really steep. Overall a nice short hike. $15 to park. Same Parking for the hike and beach access.', ""Fun trail for family hike. Poles Trail section a  little steep for the little people but hey it's all good."", '', 'Nice wide smooth dirt trails, with some decent hills. $15 all day or $5/hr parking.

There are a lot of options to make the trail longer or more difficult.', 'This trail was beautiful, with great views of the ocean, and safe paths to follow, with plenty of guide posts for the beginning hikers and all others. I would definitely come here again!', 'hello everybody the hike was great ! View at sunset time was amazing. Be ready to go up seriously the first mile. after that, getting to the view of the mountains on the other side was relaxing and free of car noise :) what a pleasure ! I recommand the hike followed by a beach time to cool off.the only issue about that hike is the 15 dollars daily parking price but I definitively would do again', ""Great trail for novice hikers. We were lucky to have an amazing sunny and 75 degree day on Thanksgiving when we hiked this trail. Great ocean views and plenty of trails to choose from as you traverse into the canyon. Day parking is $15 and good for all state parks. Head across the street to the Crystal Cove bluffs (parking covered with your day pass) and walk up and down the beach after your hike. I'll be back for the longer trails soon."", 'Very dry, not much too see until you reach an ocean view. Nevertheless a good hike, not crowded and right smack next to the ocean.', 'Great trail for a first timer hiker.', 'A rather boring trail head with not much vegetation except from random vines with melons growing, but a great and challenging ascend that the kids conquered (ages 6-11).The views of the ocean and ability to easily walk over to the small beach was well worth it. The kids loved running in the water at sunset and cannot wait to camp there next time.', ""Nice ocean view from the top.  Otherwise a very boring, dusty trail.  Most of the vegetation is weed and only wildlife is a few birds in the lower part.  Lots of spider webs, if you want to count that as wildlife.  $15 to park your car is outrageous given how awful this hike is.  There are lots of options to extend your hike, but I honestly can't see why you'd want to.  At least you can head over to the beach afterwards to rinse the dust off your legs.  Better yet, skip this hike and walk the beach instead!"", ""Well-maintained and easy, fun hike. Worth doing for the views and I would even say that it's definitely worth the $15 parking fee. The loop is awesome because it drops you off at the beach, which is really rad."", 'Five stars for the workout getting to the top of the hill and five stars for the view once you get there.  The trail was not crowded at all.  Well-maintained.  Still a beginner at this and so the trek to the top was a little difficult with a backpack full of camera equipment, but once you get there, the views were amazing!', ""There were a bunch of different trails to loop around and the maps were very helpful. The hike itself was fairly easy and it wasn't too crowded. however I went just before 8AM. It got busy by about 10. Parking is $15 for the whole day or $5/hr. I'd recommend the day pass. I payed for 2 hours, but I could've stayed for much longer.  The view of the ocean and the surrounding hills and valleys was very pretty. Overall it was super fun and definitely worth checking out."", '', 'beautiful view of the ocean. we went in august though so all the brush was dead, it was crazy hot, and there was no shade. the trail was pretty dusty but alright. we ended up getting lost (and probably taking the long loop) so the hike ended up taking around 3-4 hrs. still a fun hike though!', 'Easy hiking trail near Laguna Beach. Mostly desert scrub brush but has some nice views of the surrounding hills and ocean. At the end of the loop  you can hike to the RV park for a nice view of the Pacific ocean  and adjacent beach.', 'Nice views! Watch out for rattle snakes!', ""Pretty view of the Ocean. This was one of my first hikes so its good for beginners too. Moderate difficulty with a few stretches of incline. Most of the trail path is wide and open so the bikers passing by aren't a problem.

Are there any good singletrack mtn bike trails here?  We love this area for hiking."", 'Beautiful park after your done hiking in the hills you can hit the beach. We saw deer,rabbit,rattlesnakes,and tons of different birds.I want to camp at one of the back country camps there. ', 'There are lots of rabbits haha! and the ocean views are nice. Good little hike to add to my completed list.', ""We backpacked here for a night... The place was good for a one day backpacking trip, although, I'm not sure how multiple day trip would do. The BFI is exactly as named. We saw some wildlife along the way as well as some Tarantulas! The port a potties at the second camp ground were gross and smelled terrible. Pee in the brush. It's very peaceful and quiet at night and gets really dark. At night, It definitely made you feel like you were out in the wilderness.

Was beautiful and well worth it.', ""Great views of a different part of Yosemite and away from the big crowds. The trail is dotted with small waterfalls.  The trip to the top and back was about 8.8 miles, so plan your day accordingly.  Since it's out and back, you can turn around at any point.  I'm glad I brought a heavy jacket.  It got pretty cold at the top.  We have no issues with Mountain lions or bugs.  There was no snow either, even though it was mid December.  I don't think I would try the steep parts of the trail when it's icy.  Great day on the trail."", 'if you hustle it can be done in 4.5 hours, about 9 miles round trip, the view at the end of the trail is worth it!! a lot of mountain lion warnings', 'Loved it. Lots of gnats. Extra protein or breathe out of your nose!', 'Nice walk, but bring bug spray.', 'Beautiful! The pools and view and the top was well worth what for me was a challenging hike. The beginning is pretty steep but luckily for me the vast majority is steady and mild elevation gain.', 'The pools are awesome at the top. Nature’s infinity pool!', 'solid hike up to a beautiful viewpoint that has lots of exploration potential and swimming holes. got on the trail around 5pm and only saw a few other groups. lots of annoying flies! there was at least 2 piles of bear poo and on the way back heard 2 large creatures scramble away in the bush so be aware!', 'This was a great hike and so beautiful. As we made our way back down the trail we stopped by the river to rest and eat. Within about 20 min we seen a huge bear coming down the trail we were just on. The bear didn’t pay anything attention to us and just kept on traveling. We waited till we seen some other hikers coming so we had someone to walk down with because like other people have said it is a pretty quiet trail. Didn’t see anyone at the top and only passed one other couple going up. If your looking for a beautiful hike without a lot of people this hike is awesome.', 'longer than expected... well worth the walk! beautiful views. clear paths. well marked.', 'The top falls are worth the hike. Smoke every where right now because of the Ferguson Fire.  south part of the park a little bit better.', 'Did not do the trail but followed the river up to awesome swimming holes and waterfalls. First three lower holes you will see people but the farther up, its secluded enough to skinny dip!', ""It's off the beaten path and not very crowded..This was such an amazing hike! I had a blast doing it and the view was pretty good. I hike around the other side of the gorge to get a picture of all the falls and it came out great. Don't recommend that for a lot of people as the other side has no real Trail and you end up doing a lot of bushwhacking. Still met some great people and saw some amazing scenery!"", 'Beautiful hike. Lots of trees and the views at the top are amazing. We hiked in August and the water was moving slow. There were a few pools at the top that we swam in. My legs started to give out on the way down, but I’m not in the best of shape.', ""Took my wife here years ago for her first backpack.  She's in good shape but I have to admit this hike was a challenge for her.  Still, a beautiful hike and the falls, while on the smaller side, is still wonderful.  Great hike if you're looking for time in Yosemite but want to avoid crowds."", ""For parents who hike with their kids/dogs: Hiked this trail with my two boys and pupper on Mother's Day. I'd say this hike would be difficult for kids under 10, and dangerous in several areas, especially near the top at the falls. AllTrails says it's good for dogs and I don't disagree, but there is signage at the trailhead saying dogs are not allowed. Luckily this trail is lightly trafficked, so fewer people to complain, I guess. It is beautiful though, with awesome views of Wawona valley, wildflowers, and wildlife. It took us about 6 hours to complete. We took our time on the way up, took several breaks to eat and enjoy the scenery, and we ran most of the way back. Will definitely hike this again."", 'This was a great hike definitely up on the 10 mile marker for distance though not 6.9. View at the upper falls was amazing however getting up there at some points was steep overall a great hike', ""it was almost 10 miles to the base of the main falls. 8 miles to a smaller one. I don't know who got 6.9??? I'm 53 and would call this hike moderate but I'm in shape and was sore for a couple days after."", 'Not too much of a scenary at first but once youre at the top! its breath taking! in all ways! haha. We lounged where there was a little pool area where it looked out to the valley. Beautiful. just beautiful.', 'Great hike with steep switchbacks towards the end. Very rewarding view from the top. The top of the falls is a great place to stop for lunch and soak the feet in the cold clear water. Agree with previous review, this is probably a hard level hike not moderate.', 'Absolutely beautiful hike along the falls.', 'Somewhere in the upper-moderate challenging level.  This is a beautiful hike, but I\'m not going to be leading this hike and calling it ""moderate"" due to the 2,200 foot elevation gain and constant climbing.  There is a strenuous .3 mile start up to the falls but after that the hike levels out.  I definitely recommend someone being in shape in order to pull this one off.  I am leading a group on this hike and in order to keep it at the ""moderate"" level, we will probably not go to the top.', 'Really enjoyed the flora and the incredible vistas and the waterfalls that are abundant all the way up!', 'Power through the punishing ascent at the beginning. It’s worth it! This has stunning florae the whole way that made me feel like I was in the Pacific Northwest. There’s also tons of manzanita (and really old, grown in manzanita). There are some switchbacks about 3/4 of the way in that took me longer than I’d care to admit to complete, but the falls itself are worth the climb. I’m surprised this hasn’t been featured on Westworld or something. It has a foreboding, imposing look and has to be seen to be believed. If you are scared of heights, be forewarned that the top of the falls may creep you out a bit.', ""Hiked to the falls, and the loop you see on the map above it counter clockwise.  If you do that it's about 18 miles total and doubles your elevation gain.  Also as of writing this the trail on the southern side of that loop was washed out and disappeared, so make sure you either you know how to navigate.  Needless to say if you throw in that loop this trail is challenges and the 10 decent is brutal on the joints."", 'Did this hike yesterday. It was an awesome hike. If you are looking for a hike in Yosemite that is nice and not to crowded with people I would definitely recommend this one.', 'A great trail with some steep sections.  Like most trails in Yosemite, there is some elevation on this one.  Moderate is a good description.  Wear broke in boots/shoes.  This is a nice starting point to link to some other sights such as Taft Point, Glacier Point, and Panorama.  This hike and the connecting trails up top are some of the least crowded in the park.  Nice water features and secluded camping along the way.  The upper section Chilnualna Creek is also full of eager wild trout, so pack a fly rod ;-)', ""It's not that moderate. If you have not hiked for a while you'll be in for a treat."", 'Fun short hike', 'This is a fairly tough hike and a good amount of it is exposed to the sun, so hydrate beforehand and bring plenty of water with you. I went in April, and there were plenty of places along the way to refill my water bottles for filtering, but I imagine that it is very dry in the summer without the opportunity to refill water. Snacks are also a must, as you will expend a fair amount of energy. It took me just over 5 hours round trip (with some stops to rest, refill water, and of course to take in the views, which are breathtaking - besides the waterfall views, there are also amazing views of the Wawona valley and Wawona Dome). This trail was not crowded at all when I went in April, which was a nice change from the day before when I was hiking a Yosemite Valley trail. On this trail, I encountered perhaps 12-15 other hikers.The wading pool mentioned in the description was not accessible when I went, as there was a lot of extra powerful water steams flowing outwards from the falls due to the spring snowmelt and recent rain. As mentioned in the description, there really is no point where one can see the entire waterfall - however, the hike is still totally worth it just for the views of the valley below, and of course the views of the waterfall are still impressive.', 'great not really steep hike apart from couple of sections,  gorgeous waterfalls, sceneries and forest - highly recommend!', 'Gorgeous waterfalls! Must do trail!', 'Great view with nice waterfalls', 'Tuff hike with lots of gear. but beautiful sights.', 'Great trip to the top, still some snow', 'Steep climbs and powerful views!', 'Great hike! Nice to avoid the crowds of The Valley and still enjoy the amazing views that Yosemite has to offer. If you doing a day hike and traveling light, it’s pretty easy. That being said, make sure you bring enough water, we had a family ask us to pump them water because they only had a couple of small bottles between the five of them. We camped in and it was pretty steep with our gear. But overall definitely an amazing hike.', 'Falls were beautiful. Nice weather. No snow. A must do!', 'This hike so hard, but It was so worth it!', 'awesome view, nice and cold swimming pool near the waterfall', ""Great hike! If you hike up to the top of the waterfall it'll be right at 8.5 miles round trip. The gnats are torture all along the way, but the view at the top is totally worth it."", 'Must do in spring!', 'Beautiful hike well worth the effort.  Would have given it 5 Stars but the gnats were horrific! Recommend an early start to avoid those pesky critters.', ""A moderately tough hike, but beyond worth it. Chilnualna falls might be the most beautiful place on earth. There's jumping rocks by the swimming hole, & the sunsets are amazing."", 'I loved this hike because it was not crowded like all the other trails on in The Valley floor. Breathtaking views when you reach the top!', 'Great Hike! If you plan on going to the top bring lots of water. An amazing hike, such beauty. Will do again..', '', ""Scary fire right now but a nice hike.  One thing...it's more than 7.2 miles, it's more like 9ish."", 'Very nice trail that leads to an amazing view', 'Great day hike most times of the year. I went in August 2016 and the falls were pretty dry. Would love to come back when the falls are roaring! Beautiful scenery up top of the trail too', 'love this trail. the falls are awesome and if you backpack you will visit up to 3 lakes. also this trail is not over crowded.', 'Awesome falls, amazing pictures, and a great little workout.', 'Excellent hike, less busy than most other trails in Yosemite. Pretty steep initial climb but it becomes more a moderate climb the rest of the way. Definitely longer than 7.2 though. We thought closer to 10.', 'Wonderful hike! Be sure you bring plenty water and a water purifier just in case.', 'The milage is 5.6 miles to the trail junction, which is at the upper falls. So in/out 11.2 miles. We just got off the trail, backpacking a loop from the trailhead. From the falls trl head it is a non-stop incline. There are 4 small creeks that cross the trail, so a filter is helpful. Use deet!', 'This is one my my families favorite hikes.  We do it yearly.   There is little traffic.  If you are lucky, the marmots will join you at the falls.', ""I love this hike but just so you know it's not 7.2 miles it's at 9.6 miles round-trip"", 'Agree with Kelli. Perfect spring hike. Lots of wildflowers.  Bring lots of water!', 'As spectacular as a high Sierra day hike can be. Few people, because it is relentlessly uphill. There are 20 yards of technical, exposed trail less than a mile in, near a marvelous falls overview; nothing beyond is as challenging. The top is outstanding and undoubtedly worth the effort: boisterous falls, panoramic views, floral wall trailside, and a large granitic saddle for meandering.', 'We were fortunate to hike this trail in early May when the falls were absolutely cranking. There were a few small falls along the way as well. Nice wildflowers, and only a few other hikers on the trail. A great half day hike - if you are staying in Wawona campground, it is definitely worth doing this hike away from the crowds of The Valley!', 'Nice, hike when Valley floor is full, not to many people on the trail. Hike was not to bad for the small ones in the group, plus seeing the falls with that much water was worth it', 'Nice waterfall views right at the beginning! Worth the climb. Not difficult. Saw loads of children going up with a group excursion!', 'Nice escape from Valley crowds with cascading falls. Continuous moderate climb with some fairly level areas make this a nice 1st day for backpacking or dayhike/trail run. There is an initial waterfall payoff very close to the start. After that, the trail moves away from the fall. The trail returns to the water a couple times, most notably by the top. Continue on up to the trail junction for more views. The junction is a good turn around point for day hikers...or cross the creek via a couple  ""interesting"" fallen log options for backpackers. Both options have their pros/cons. If the water isn\'t strong, perhaps ford between the two log options.', ""Beautiful hike up to some great falls. Wonderful scenery on the way, including several small creek falls/pools at least when we went, late spring after a wet winter so falls are roaring this spring! Several great viewed of the falls/river on the way up. NPS rated the hike as strenuous and says its 4.1 miles one way, so I think it's a bit longer than what is listed here. Steepest in the beginning and the end, the bulk of it was not very steep. We headed out about 8:30am, only one other car on the trailhead. Saw a pair of does on the way up, and had the trail mostly to ourselves until the top. Passed a lot more people on the way back but still not as heavily trafficked as many main Yosemite hikes. If you start at the trailhead parking you're probably doing about 9mi total, as you hike the lower falls first and then access the main trail after you pass that. We love to hike, are not as fit as some, so it was strenuous for us (overall) but totally with it!"", 'Such a great hike! More awesome/beautiful than we had even anticipated!', 'awesome hike!', ""Hiked today and was amazing!!!!!  Falls are raging (5/7/17). Chilly towards the top so bring some layers and also you get a slight mist!  The hike up is definitely taxing (a solid moderate)The view is great.  Trail is FAR less crowded than Any of the trail heads from the valley floor. You can also reach other trail heads at the summit and keep going.It's a 2,500ft elevation gain. Bring plenty of water and snacks. Would recommend!! The drive in from the Oakhurst side is about an hour less than reaching half dome village so if you live in the area or are looking to not travel all the way in to the park this is perfect. Turn right on chiliunala falls drive and go about 2 miles and it takes you straight to the trail head. :)"", 'Amazing views great trail love it.', ""Hiked on 4/23, the cascades were raging. This is one of Yosemite's best trails outside the Valley. Offers up close views of the cascades for amazing photo opportunities, and you don't have to hike far to enjoy them."", 'Waterfalls are really full. Tough first quarter mile but the views at the top are great.', 'Awesome views throughout but a bit scary in windy or rainy conditions', ""As good as it gets!  Plenty of spots to stop and enjoy the beautiful views that you won't mind the uphill hike. The views from the top are amazing!!!"", 'Beautiful views!!', ""Starting from the trailhead, you get a decent opportunity to warm up your legs with about a half mile of gradual incline before hitting granite cut stairs and switchbacks. There's ample opportunity to ease the burn in your legs after a few short steep uphill, which is nice when you're taking older kids who would otherwise want to stop every half mile or so to rest. We hiked in late February, the snow was spotty until we reached about 5500 feet altitude. Starting the hike at 0500 in 20 degree weather wasn't bad but once you get up the exposed region .75 miles from the summit, it gets a lot cooler with downslope winds. The ambient temp was 18 at that point and because noticeably colder with the wind. We made fresh prints in the snow from where the trail again meets Chilnualna Falls and at the summit it is BRISK. The views are amazing and worth braving the wind and cold. Parts of the trail where it got icy would have been really nice to have crampons, especially the last .5 mikes to the summit (and a few smaller areas shortly before that). You have to weigh the inconvenience of carrying them with how determined you are to reach the summit, because there are parts that are pretty perilous in just good lugged boots. I did the hike in trail runners (my foot gear of choice for almost all hikes) and was fine since I had a good pair of socks, but for an unseasoned hiker, you may want to stick with something that takes a bit more bite in snow and ice f you plan on doing this in the winter or early spring."", ""My girlfriend and I backpacked this trail in September 2015. we did two day to Johnson lake. got a late start so we didn't make it to Royal Arch. it is possible to make it to Johnson I. on day. it's about 14 mils. Good fishing and there was still water in most of the streams."", ""Straight up but well worth the hike.  Late summer, when the falls have slowed down, you can swim at the top edge!! It's beautiful."", 'If done in the full distance, as I did, it will be rather strenuous. Lots of inclined switchbacks with little to no river view for about 2/4 of the time. The long haul is worth the climb though. there is about 3 pools to stop at and the tallest has a plethora of holes to swim in. CAUTION!!! These pools that move slower than the rest of the river do have leeches in them. Check your body before you decide to go back down. bring water and walking sticks will help a ton.', 'Awesome chest deep pool midway up the falls. Well worth the hike!', 'We did only the first part of the trail, to the lower falls, and it was great. Only about a 45 minute hike total, which was all we needed this day. Our five year old did awesome on the hike. Not crowded at all.', 'We hiked up with the plan to spend the night at the top and then continue on the trail for five days.  We found such a nice spot with a secluded pond not too far from the falls that we stayed there the entire time.  Beautiful!', 'Was a very nice view at the end. A little tough on the way up, but just took a few breaks along the way. Would definitely do this one again!', ""This was a bit difficult, but doable!  We made it to where the water falls are close up and the area has a rocky open area.  We had lunch and then headed back down!  Amazing views and spent the day with some great friends.  We all felt it was an awesome hike and shouldn't be missed!"", 'Thoroughly enjoyed this trail. Hiked it April 30. Started early and had the trail to ourselves. Very cool but as the day wore on the layers came off. The falls were really flowing. Had a picnic lunch above the falls where there was still snow. The sun was warming. On the hike back there were many people coming up. Bring water.', 'loved this trail.  my group are in their 60s and 70s.   the trail is shaded by the trees and this was very welcome as it was 80 F.  the slope is very gradual.  you scarcely feel the 2.300 feet go by. we completed the ascent in just 2 hrs and 20 minutes.the views of the lower falls are the best.', 'Loved it!', 'Incredible! Service is spotty. Lost recording on All Trails and Strava. Hike was awesome. So worth it.Think the hike is closer to 4.5 in and out, totaling close to 9 mi round trip.', 'It was a great trail away from the bustle and activity in the valley area. Spectacular views from the waterfalls', 'Went 5.6 up to the wilderness camping area and spent the night.  It was an awesome trail that was not too difficult. Wanted to go on into the high country before camping but the trails to both Buck and Deer camp were not visable due to snow pack. Went in March, the only person up there, and when the sun set Im pretty sure I was the only human for 5 miles. An amazing experience.', 'I am from mariposa and this is one of my favorite hikes so beautiful and it has so many pools. Be careful in the winter time it does get dangerous at the top can be very slippery', 'Beautiful scenery and plenty of spots to take a quick swim!', ""Gorgeous hike with breathtaking vistas.  I'm going to call it strenuous, although I just completed it on an 85 degF day while 5 months pregnant and hauling a 30 lb backpack.  It took my husband and I about 5 1/2 hours to reach the top of the falls and then additional time to find and set our camp.  It took less than half the time for the descent the following day though.  One of the best parts about the trail is the abundance of crystal clear mountain pools to take a dip or just soak your feet, and since there is a constant, vigorous flow, the water is safe to drink - we confirmed at the visitors center when we picked up our wilderness pass that the water IS potable.  We drank it straight from the falls for 2 days.  It's ice cold and refreshing! Although the trail was strenuous (I am still recovering!), I would definitely do it again (AFTER the baby comes) and hopefully spend some more time exploring the deeper wilderness trails at the top.  The site says it's a 7 mile round trip, but it's actually 4.1 miles from the trailhead which starts at the top of a steep granite stairway built into the base of the falls, making it about an 8.5 mi round trip - a bit long for a day hike if you aren't properly conditioned.  Many people just stop to visit the base section, which is dramatic  all by itself, but I definitely recommend sticking it out all the way to the top.  Wilderness area (where you can camp) starts 5.6 miles from the parking area on Chilnualna Falls Rd."", ""Nice mellow hike, I hiked this in early November while camping in Wawona. Even that late in the season there was a decent amount of traffic. Plenty of places to take a freezing dip along the trail. I took this opportunity and jumped into a pool that had a nice rock to stand on and get pummeled by a waterfall above. I'm sure this would be impossible earlier in the season. So I guess this is a better hike in the summer when the falls has more volume."", ""In terms of beauty and uniqueness, this trail matched even that of Half Dome but was totally different in it's own way.  Starts out pretty steep and loved the Manzano trees that were in abundance and the nearby falls for the first hour.  You will quickly ascend into the forest of big pine trees and will discover the beauty of ground carpet called mountain misery.  Look like a fern with white showy flowers and the stems are woody. The trail in this area had a fine layer of freshly fallen ponderosa pine needles and was a very picturesque scene.  Ran into a frightened couple from Europe who had just showed me the rattlesnake on their phone camera that caused them to turn around...glad they beat me to it as it was coiled up in the middle of the trail. Took us about 2.5 hours to get to the Falls up top and what a sensation. One pool after another with cascading water.  Very special place and no one else was in sight for the hour we we spent on top.  Made it back down in 1 hr. 35 min.  It's mountain lion country so just be aware.  Was a challenging day especially considering we had hiked 5 or 6 miles in the Mariposa Grove that morning."", ""Moderately difficult hike, quick elevation gain in the beginning but don't let this scare you. The trail evens out to a gradual gain totaling 2500 feet in just a little over 4 miles. There are no mile markers until the upper falls are reached. Spectacular views that will make you thrilled you conquered this hike.  "", 'Great hike with several spots to enjoy the outdoors, Started 9:00am and finished @ 3:00pm.', ""This is a great day hike, but start early, starts low and can be very warm, you have an early incline so the heat makes it tough. But when you get to the first falls don't stop there, go 15 min more up and around and there is the best places to put your feet in the water and see the best part of the falls. It is an one of my favorite trails."", ""Great day hike three springs in a row.  It's all up to the top of the falls, but the reward is an ungrounded beautiful stream to play in and warm granite stones to eat lunch on before you head back down the hill.  Backbacking there again in three weeks to explore the alpine lake loop.  I can hardly wait."", 'Great hike. Long to top but worth it. Not so busy and very scenic. Good for average level hiker', ""We had a great time hiking this trail.  You start right off with a spectacular waterfall, if you take the trail to the right at the very start.  I couldn't believe the weather that day, sunny and warmish. For this time of year we only saw a little snow. I attached some photos of the lower falls.\nEnjoy."", 'Absolutely beautiful trail.', 'This is a beautiful trail! I did it with my bro during the last week of December 2009 and 2010 and I did it by myself in December 2008. Lots of snow intermittently and at the top, but the falls are gorgeous partially frozen!! Just be well prepared. The views all around are classic Yosemite! Love it!', 'Hiked this trail in May and enjoyed the hike.  Compared to other trails in Yosemite Valley, this is not overused at all.  We came across deer grazing near the hiking trail at about 2 miles into the hike.  Good gradients for elevation gain make it a comfortable hike despite the overall elevation gain.  Falls were beautiful at the top - great place to take in the peace and tranquility.', ""I accompanied Mike Ferrara up this trail and agree with everything he said. It was also one of my favorite hikes to date and intend to head back up there this year. (Hopefully without the heavy snow) The waterfalls along the trail are amazing, especially at the top! The hike itself isn't all that difficult so this can easily be a day hike along with an over nighter.\n\nHighly recommended!"", 'Awesome trail. Decided to take advantage of the lack of snow. Left about 9:15 in the morning and got back around 3:30-4.  Pretty challenging switchbacks out of the valley. good day.', ""We went late May and experienced significant snow at the top of the falls. It had been an abnormally heavy snow season the previous winter so I'm not sure if this was to be expected, the ranger assured us all snow would be melted (He was a replacement for an ill ranger for the day who admitted having minimal knowledge of the area). Lots of water, lots of weaving in and out of meadows, woods and riverside."", ""From what I remember, this hike was a lot of climbing, and there weren't many great views of the waterfall once you got to the top.  The views of Wawona are nice, as are the cascades, but it would not be my first pick if I were to do a waterfall hike in Yosemite."", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '',

Grass Lake. Quiet trail - only saw a few other hikers on the path. Extremely rocky which can slow the pace. Definitely recommend keep the map with you because the trail can be a little hard to follow at times. Grass Lake was peaceful - light breeze but relaxing.', 'Great trail. Rocky and flat in the beginning. Beautiful views at Grass Lake. Quick easy hike that one can finish within a few hours.', 'This is my favorite trail that we hiked this year! I would definately do it again! It was strenuous but not to hard and so beautiful. ', 'The trail was nice and relatively easy.  Itself the trail would only be 2-stars.  The treat was coming across the soda spring and circa 1900 resort at Glen Alpine Springs with cabins and other buildings designed by Maybeck.', 'Walking on rocks the entire time, not very scenic. This has to be one of the worse in Lake Tahoe', 'Me and my wife did this trail this Saturday. There are big rocks on the trail, then after sometime there is gravely trail. It is hard with normal shoes because you have to put every step very carefully on the rocks so as not to slip. There is small waterfall at around 1 mile which is good to chill for a bit. \n\nBONUS: Climb the rocks on the side of the waterfall and follow the stream, there is another pool filled with water worth seeing and dipping in. All in all a good experience.\n\nPS. Do not park your car until you reach the parking lot at the trailhead, you might get lucky and find a parking right there. I saw some sedans climbing up that one lane road that leads up to the trailhead parking, so do not worry if you are not sure if your car will make it (I seriously though the road was small enough and filled with potholes that small sedans/hatchbacks cannot make it but I was wrong)!', 'We went with our 3 boys and we only made it about 2 miles in. But if you stop about 1.2 miles in you will pass a small waterfall. There’s a red fire department bin, take this small trail to the waterfall. You can take a quick dip near the waterfall. However, my 6 y.o. discovered another awesome part of the waterfall!  If you keep climbing up the rocks near the waterfall (if you are facing the waterfall it would be your 10 o’clock), It will lead you to the top of the waterfall. Follow the  water upstream and you’ll find a small lagoon like area w another smaller waterfall. There’s a rock in the middle that you can use to jump off. A small secret spot that my family and I enjoyed. Many photo opportunities. One warning, we did see a small water snake under one of the rocks there but it didn’t bother us so we didn’t bother it!  Other than that, uber chill spot off this trail but well worth the climb!', 'I was glad reviewers mentioned to keep driving until you get to the parking lot.  We had almost lost hope with all the cars parked on the road making it very hard to pass drivers going the opposite direction. But we got to the parking lot and found the trail head easily.The trail is covered with large rocks, then small rocks for almost a 1/2mile going up hill making for an unstable walk. And with all the rocky and gravely paths I noticed I had to concentrate on each step taking from being able to look around while walking so we stopped more often than I normally do when hiking cause I would slip each time I took to long looking up to enjoy the views. Early/late morning the trail is mostly sunny. But mid afternoon it becomes more shady.  Except once you pass the Soda Springs house it is up hill (with rock steps) and all sunny. And it almost seems like you won’t get there. And then after a few summits you reach it. Note; I wouldn’t bring kids past the second creek crossing and seeing two dogs on the path, it was clear, their paws were hurting. Took us 3hrs from Lily Lake to Grass Lake (including a 40min lunch, along w/a dip in the water) and 1hr back to the parking lot.', 'Beautiful trail and lots of history along the way. My sister and I learned lots about that area by just reading the post along the way. We did bring the pup but would HIGHLY recommend booties. Our pup always hikes in her boots and on this trail it was necessary because of all the loose rock. Also found some cool swimming spots near the waterfall!!', 'Nice trail, lots of different rocky terrain. Wouldn’t recommend bringing a pup without booties. Our dog’s pads got all torn up :(. Would bring bug spray if going to Susie lake, lots of mosquitos in the marshy stretch.', 'Worth the 3+ mile drive to the parking area where there is lots of parking. Hiked with our dogs and passed few hikers on our way out, a few more on our way back, but no other dogs. We hiked out to grass lake. Only part of the trail that was a little tricky was the creek crossing where it wasn’t obvious. But if you look to the left you see the logs across the creek and it picks up the trail there. Amazing views.', 'Awesome views! Worth the drive.', 'moderate trail I love the waterfalls', 'This trail was pretty that took us to old out buildings & a gorgeous waterfall. It’s a pretty rocky trail with lots of bugs, but the beauty is worth it', 'Parked just above fallen leaf lake on a small patch of cleared roadside. We didn’t know there’s a small parking lot (and bathrooms) about a half mile up where the trail begins. Take a picture of the map before you start. We then hiked to Grass Lake. About 6 total miles out and back. The beginning mile is quite rocky so have stable footwear. And if you have any knee/ankle issues, bring poles especially for the way back. To get to Grass Lake you will have to climb across logs at two different points, not a big deal. Just be careful with kids and dogs. Also BRING WATER and snacks, there’s shade but lots of exposed trail. We saw a family with a group of teens and only one girl had on a backpack and everyone else had 20 oz or less sized water bottles, nothing else. That’s not enough in the summer. Their water was gone before even making the halfway point and they were struggling. Think about yourself, your kids, your dogs and be safe! When we got to the lake we set up our hammocks and hung out for about 90 mins before heading back. So worth it!', ""Sad that people don't have the adventurous spirits to explore this area more. They stop before getting to the best parts of this trail. Grass lake is so much fun to hike too, creek crossings, waterfalls, rock hopping, to be rewarded with a valley and lake surrounded by massive peaks and waterfalls visible from many directions. Don't be lazy than give a low review. This trail is awesome, if you can hike more than a mile lmao."", ""Road conditions up to the official trailhead are questionable; no snow removal during the winter months. Parking is available both at trailhead (currently closed) and alongside the road. Ice and snow remain on last 0.5 miles of road as of 4/9.\n\nAs others have stated, the trail begins on a rocky path. The rocks are cobble rather than pebbles or boulders. After warm rainfall and above-freezing spring temperatures, this trail was flooded under ~6 inches of water for a short section. Waterproof boots worked well. After Lily Lake, the trail is a mixture of cobble and paved, wide enough for an ATV but not quite a 4x4 trail. The immediate surroundings are poor compared to other Tahoe hikes.\n\nSince there was significant snow accumulation over 7,000 feet, I turned back at Glen Alpine Falls rather than heading up to Grass Lake. Others have noted there's little to see after the falls. I didn't travel far enough to verify this, but based on satellite and heatmap, this seems correct. Assuming you park before the Lower Glen Alpine Falls, located right past the fire station, there are three main attractions. \n\nThe first is Lower Glen Alpine Falls, which can be reached by car and is a popular tourist attraction. Some call it the most popular waterfall in Tahoe (debatable, since Lower Eagle Falls commands attention). The second is Lily Lake, a swamp-like flooded basin that beautifully reflects Echo Peak. Lastly, the true Glen Alpine Falls, around 0.5 miles up the trail, is a rushing fall at the base of Tallac. Beyond that, there's Grass Lake an additional two miles further.\n\nEven though the waterfalls are beautiful and Mount Tallac is always a surreal sight, this trail is little more than a decent outing. Paved portions and operational cabins/houses detract from the backcountry feel. Similarly, the two-mile section of relative uninterest combined with a wide track falter when compared to vicinity hikes, especially Aloha and Ralston. Keep in mind that I didn't hike the full trail, though, so take this review with a grain of salt."", 'Rough stone at the start, so wear sturdy shoes.  Water had covered parts of the trail on 11/22 making it slow going as we had to hop across stones and logs, or go off the path to avoid the water. We only went for about a mile before turning back because the trail was difficult to navigate with dogs given the flooding.', ""Awesome Hike.  multiple waterfalls, creek and the two lakes....  Very Rocky fir the first mile,  two stream log/rock crossings.  Grass Lake is beautiful.  We clocked 5.7 miles.  Old Glen Alpine camp/lodge was great to see.  So sad it's no longer operational, but old photos on the scrapbook bulletin board were great to see.  Would definately do it again."", 'Gorgeous hike.  Easy climb.  Walked across the streams.  We saw a sleeping bear on a rock ledge above the trail.   The water in Grass Lake was warm enough for a nice dip!!  The historical sight with the old springs was pretty cool to check out.  The trail is rocky in the beginning.  Lots of gorgeous waterfalls!', ""hiked up to Granite Lake -- beautiful and varied terrain. your dog might need to know how to swim for the second stream crossing past Grass Lake. some cool history at the abandoned resort. I'd recommend boots/shoes even for the waterfall hike since the trail is really rocky for the first mile, though flat. saw a group of hikers with their snowboards!"", 'Beautiful hike! 2 miles in you will reach desolation wilderness territory which requires an annual permit. There are permit forms to fill out are at the information board at the trailhead.', 'Great hike, a couple of stream crossings. First one is easy, second one more challenging if water is high. Lake with waterfall is worth the hike. Couple of nice waterfalls on the way up.', 'Hiked on Sunday August 12, 2017.  Arrived at the parking lot around 9:45 AM and was mostly full. This is a great hike that starts off with a somewhat rocky trail but eventually smooths out.  Nice waterfall within first half mile of leaving trailhead. We were amazed how much water there was this year in August! We continued up to Grass lake and stopped there for a rest and a bite to eat. Beautiful setting with another waterfall in view in the distance.  Get an early start and enjoy.', 'Hike to Grass Lake was beautiful, but wandering throughout the day above Grass Lake was really cool.  Great views, rocky hiking, and a perfect campsite high above the lake.', 'Great trail with lots of water. Starts with  a gorgeous water fall and leads to different lakes. Views are phenomenal. Mainly uphill all the way to Grass Lake making the trip back a breeze. We took our 4 kids (ages 16,14,7 and 7) and dog and everyone did great. We took the trail to Grass Lake. Out and back the trail was about 7 miles. This trail is about 75% Rocky. I felt like it was an easy-moderate trail. Road leading to trailhead is VERY narrow, making it hard to pass another oncoming car. The road is also in poor condition, a lot of pot holes. We went on a Saturday around 1030am and the parking was scarce.', ""super fun a beautiful hike! mostly up hill at first but well worth it. we took our dog and there were plenty of watering holes and creeks for him to cool off at. we ended up going to grass lake which was beautiful. there were a few creek crossings. the first one was easy to cross the log, but the second log crossing was a little more difficult as the log was a little higher up and made it a little more difficult for my dog to cross so we just walked him through the creek instead. the water wasn't to cold and was actually really refreshing. The view was beautiful up at the lake and definitely worth the hike."", 'Rough start since the trail appears to have about 3 inches of water but there is a trail in the bush to the right. After that the trail is nice... took a 10 year old and a 70 year old with us and they all did well.', ""I've never done the full hike. We only hike to the falls, which is a mile at most (2 miles round trip) It's pretty easy. My mom, who hasn't hiked in almost 30 years, did it without a problem. The beginning of the trail is super rocky (I think it used to be a riverbed), so you just have to be careful with your footing and wear good shoes so that the rocks don't hurt your feet. Once you get to the red FP (fire protection) sign and shed, you veer off trail to the left, and you'll be at the waterfall. It's gorgeous! I highly recommend!"", ""7/15/2017 HikeTrail starts out as gravelly dirt road and the  it becomes more of a real trail and it gets steep after the first 1/2ish mile. Lots of water crossings and had to cross 3 log bridges to cross creeks.  We did get lost and missed the left turn (marker is behind a big pine tree) and ended up going up the steep mountain heading to suzie/aloha/gilmore lakes, and added 2 hours to our trek, that took all of our energy. Grass lake was worth every swear word though. The waterfall at the end of Grass lake is massive and although the water was freezing at first, it's tolerable so we took a dip and hung out in the water a bit.  Would definitely come back."", ""This trail has some of the most scenic views in the area with several water falls, rushing streams and snow capped mountains.  No bugs.  I never made it to Grass Lake since I chickened out on the last log crossing of Glen Alpine Creek.  That brings me to why I only gave this trail 3 stars.  Like other reviewers, one of my main dislikes was the first mile or so which consists of loose, fist sized rocks which were very difficult to walk on without twisting my ankles.  There are also a good amount of smaller course ground up rocks both of which are tough on smaller dogs.  The other problem for me was the last creek crossing which requires walking on a rather long fallen tree to get across.  I was packing about 24 lbs. and was alone so didn't feel comfortable with the task.  Not for chickens if you want to get to the lake and beyond."", 'Crossed the log over the creek just past the Susie Lake / Grass Lake fork. Chickened out crossing over the next log at Glen Alpine Creek. Only about 20 minutes away from Grass Lake - maybe next time', 'Bring bug spray! Great hike overall.', 'Fun moderate trail', 'It was a great trail with a lot of run off cascading down the trail', ""I suggest waiting till the snow is fully melted and the river currents aren't so strong before you attempt this trail because you have to cross the river and it's extremely full and fast moving as a result increased snow fall this year. We placed logs to get across, but it was dangerous and I don't suggest doing it. Probably best to wait a couple of more weeks. We had to go off trail and made it about half a mile from Grass lake, but felt it was unsafe to go any further."", 'I love this hike. We do it once a year. Flooded in areas along the trail but still worth it. Water fall is big this year', 'Great waterfall about a mile up. Swampy after the wet winter.', ""Great trail into Desolation with many different option for hiking and camping.Very rocky trail so trail shoes are a huge  benefit. We brought poles, but didn't use them. Moderate trail and easy to navigate.  We hiked from the trailhead to Lake Aloha in an attempt to do Jack's Peak and Dick's Peak. Fairly easy hike and well maintained trail. Bagging the peaks from a clockwise approach isn't an option unless you have some serious climbing skills. We will try it again another time going around Gilmore and heading up to Dick's Peak first. Here's a full recap: http://hustzkergies.blogspot.com/2016/10/glen-alpine-trail-hike.html"", 'We did both Grass Lake and Gilmore Lake. Beautiful hike.', 'Concur with others, your feet will appreciate good hiking shoes.  Wore hiking boots and still the soles of my feet were a bit sore. Trailhead parking is difficult on weekends.  This is an entry point for Desolation.  Lot was full at 1pm. Parked about a 1/4 mi down the road.  Worth the hike though.', ""Hiked all the way to Grass Lake, and it was moderately challenging especially with much of trail being large loose rocks that easily tip - be careful if you have weak ankles. Crossing Glen Alpine Creek was also a bit confusing as it wasn't obvious where you were supposed to cross. But you get gorgeous sweeping views of the surrounding mountains and Grass Lake itself is very pretty, especially with few to no people using it. Very calm and serene. The only thing I didn't like about getting to this hike was the 3 miles of narrow one-lane road for both directions of traffic, worse with bicyclists also on the road."", 'Beautiful mountain trails with waterfalls, meadows, springs (nasty), historical buildings, wildlife and the plague. The chipmunk and squirrels have the plague here so the sign says', 'This is a great trail - the only down side is the ""ankle turning"" rocks along most of the trail that slow you down a bit. Nice history lesson at Glen Alpine Springs. One waterfall between Fallen Leaf Lake and Lily Lake and then 2 waterfalls between Lily Lake and the Glen Alpine Springs. Will be going back when we have more time to hike up to the other lakes:)', ""Loved this trail even though we weren't able to make it to Grass Lake. The trail has a lot of water on it, snow in a few places and several rivers to cross. First river crossing was pretty easy. The second river crossing was not possible without getting wet at the trail. I hiked down stream and found a large tree that had fallen over the river and crossed on that. Third river crossing did not happen for us. If I was without my standard poodle I would have been able to make it across, but it was a little too difficult for my dog, so I turned back . I think I was pretty close to Grass Lake, but just couldn't get all the way there. Great adventure and I'm looking forward to returning and trying this again."", ""Really rocky trail- the fall is within the first .25 mile and beyond that there isn't too much to see. There's the old spring but all the old buildings are closed up. Pretty exposed in some parts- I recommend a hat."", ""In general, the Sierra's are beautiful and everything around Tahoe is even more so. We took this route to Mt Tallac, recorded approx 14 miles, of course with wandering around the Glen Alpine Springs and old resort grounds and following the boy all over the awesome granite out croppings and formationd that were worthy of photo opportunities for the youngen. All though quite rocky trail, if wearing proper foot wear, boots, you'll be ok if you're an avid hiker or even a beginner with decent balance. Take the time to go up to peak, you'll never forget the awesome experience! Be prepared to burn up some film, wait, that dated me, digital moments!"", ""We used this trail to descend Mt Tallac after going up The Mt Tallac trail. The section between Mt Tallac and Gilmore Lake is wonderful. The rest of the trail is horrible! Nothing but foot-crushing, ankle-twisting shale and stone. I'm talking fist-sized and larger; the whole trail is made up of it. The scenery is follows the same trend; pedestrian (for this area) lower on the trail becoming more impressive as you gain altitude and spectacular as you get up around Gilmore Lake. The little abandoned town (Glen Alpine Springs?) is a cool diversion."", 'very nice views. continue another 1.4 miles up to reach the top of Tallac. much easier than the Mt Tallac Trail route', 'Beautiful little trail.  Hiked in to Grass Lake...have to save Susie and Gilmore Lakes for another day...', 'Amazing hike, rocky trail and a couple log creek crossing areas or take off your shoes and walk across them, chilly water, but manageable.Take your time to hike around the lake, well worth it! And if you are an angler take your fishing gear, lots of tasty wild trout there.Do NOT forget to put on mosquito repellant!Otherwise lovely hike. Cheers', 'A beautiful trail that is located in the high country of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The alpine lakes are stunningly blue and clear, and the grand mountains across the shore are equally grand. It was a worthwhile hike, despite how strenuous it was at times.

This is a GREAT trail! The best time to walk the trail is early in the morning - before 7:00am, which is when John Wayne Airport starts launching jets at a rate of around one every five minutes; the mornings are pristine. During the week, you'll run into people (like me) out walking their dogs in the mornings and evenings (unlike me, though, many don't seem to want to use the little blue crap bags to pick up after their canine companions). During the day the trails are virtually empty. Weekends on the back bay are different; there are TONS of people out walking, riding their bikes and jogging. There's no tree coverage, so - if you're planning on being out during the day - sunscreen and a hat are recommended. At night, the cold can come up pretty quick, so a light jacket is a good idea."", 'Great hike at the marsh and also by the bay.', 'Me and my wife, went here to celebrate our 1st year married, we rent a kayak and spent an hour navigating the upper bay and some channels.', 'Hiking up hill, walking trail.  \n\nDespite the fat piles of horse droppings, the air plane noise and super-speed cycling, this is a great walk with kids.

There's a dirt parking lot  from 7am-sundown right where the trails begin so that's where my friend and I parked. Nearing the end of our hike the sun was falling and the scene was wonderful. There's some wildlife here and there that we spotted: bunnies, ducks,  and a fox-like cub of some sort? A lot of people walking their dogs and a good amount on their bikes as well. "", 'November 2013. When it comes to the Newport Bay, I prefer the upper part. Despite the proximity to the road and the airport, there is a sense of wild beauty to it. \n\nI started at the Muth Interpretive Center, which has free parking and a free video presentation of the wildlife of Newport Bay. This video is only about 10 minutes long, and worth watching prior to your walk. While you\'re inside, check out the snakes and other live animals they have; this is a wonderful nature center.\n\nThe ""hike"" is more like a stroll on a well-maintained dirt path or paved road (they run parallel to each other, so take the path). It doesn\'t require hiking shoes or other outdoors gear. It does, however, offer wonderful views of the Back Bay. As a result, this is a great place to take a hiking newbie. Enjoy, and bring your camera! Binoculars are also a great idea, for watching the birds.', 'I love riding my road bike here!!! :)', 'More like pavement and extremely well maintained dirt path. Trails are wide enough to fit a car.  Good for running or dog walking.

It's a desirable place for birding, horse-riding, dog walking, photography. The wildflowers in the chaparral make a fabulous sight. In winter, an overwhelming species of migratory birds arrive at the bay. It's fun hitting the pastoral setting. "", ""This is an enjoyable trail that I do every Monday with a local hiking group.  It's a place where I can go with my kids and my Mom, and we enjoy the walk together.

Highly recommend hiking boots and gloves!', 'Took our kids (7 and 9) down the trail to the beach. Recommend wearing good shoes vs tennis shoes. Was a fun experience and really cool rock features.', 'Went 2 days after heavy rain. Our first rime. Surfer recommended going barefoot, he was right.! super slippery at bottom by the rope. Took Gliderport stairs back and the ridge back to HoChi Minh. Views are amazing. I agree w moderate rating. Real fun, oh yeah, for those new to area Black’s beach is one of the best breaks in area and the North side is a swimsuit optional beach.', 'My first visit was in the summer, it was hot and trail was in tact - had good fun. My second time was after rains, the trail has become little more difficult than before because of the erosion. But I would say the fun element of this trail has increased because of the erosion. A shoe with good grip is a must have.', 'A nice little jaunt that earns you a great ocean view at the end! It seemed more difficult than moderate and good hiking shoes are a must.', ""Definitely more than a moderate. Wouldn't say it's an expert though. Went with shoes but some locals said not to use em. I'd say they would've made it harder in spots. Definitely not suitable for kids or dogs. Also be careful, there's a nude beach right down the beach from the end of the trail."", 'Second time on this hike. It can be sketchy at points. Great short hike.', 'One of my favorite hikes in San Diego!', ""Very dangerous trail. This has eroded 100x worse than what it was in years past...and it is unfortunate. It is not a maintained trail and should be for the skilled hiker with proper shoes. Unstable bluffs and slippery slopes with little to hold on to make this risky AF. That said, it is a locals only surf trail with amazing views and really cool adventure trekking. Be prepared! I wouldn't be surprised if access to this location is removed from public use."", 'Full loop is one of the most fun things I’ve ever done.  Go down the stairs and up the cliffs.', 'Great trail!! Def not for kids and dogs, they will for sure slip. I loved this trail and it’s so much fun! Def brings out your rock climbing side. Only difficult part I found on this trail was towards the end when u literally need to hang on for Dear life (there’s really no where to hang on to bedsides rocks) and shuffle your way to the other side of the rock without slipping over the edge. Not sure what type of shoes to wear but I wore Nike’s and I was slipping and sliding. Some ppl say barefoot is better but I wouldn’t be bare footed the entire time. Maybe just towards the end. So pretty though, if your adventurous then this is the hike for you!', 'Don’t let the short distance fool you. This is a real hikeTrust your GPS to find the trail head.  The entry is basically unmarked - a 6’ gap wedged in between 2 fences bordering amazing homes in this upscale neighborhood.   TIP - When you see cars parked on the road you have found it.  The trail is very dusty.  Makes it slippery and you will be a filthy mess.  Don’t plan on heading to church until you shower  It’s all downhill as you descend into the canyon toward the ocean.  The top section is simple.  The middle section is highlighted by 12 foot long plank across a small stream.  Don’t panic.  It’s 12” wide.  You can make it.  Just focus.  Then you’ll find yourself squeezing into a deep and narrow crevasse cut into the sandstone.  Good Kodak moment.  The bottom section has the most tricky footing as you are frequently perched precariously on the Edge of the ravine - although it’s only 10 feet of drop off.  You will come upon a high waterfall with a trickle of water.  Just enough to make footing treacherous.  A 30’ long rope helps you balance as you navigate the final segment and hit the beach. The climb back up is significantly easier from a footing perspective.  Depending how fast you go you will feel the cardio. And just when you feel winded and take a short break some bare footed young surfer dude will come running past you with board in hand and cruising up the hill like an antelope.   Good hike.  And don’t forget to enjoy the views of the amazing homes as you climb out.', 'A couple of spots are clearly very eroded and hard for shoes to grip. I was wearing chacos and was completely fine, but my 3 other girlfriends who were wearing their running shoes (brooks, ASICS, new balance) were slipping on the steep areas. Overall, great views and very pretty scenery. On the last part of the hike where you exit down a rope, go backwards like you’re belaying down a rock wall. It was much easier.', 'Short and steep hike. Going up hill is way safer than downhill. Start from La Jolla Farm Rd and follow the paved road down to the beach and walk about half a mile to find the beginning of the trail and just walk it up. Don’t take children! That was my mistake.', 'Very challenging in spots, but beautiful views and worth it!', 'Great Hike! There are several side trails you can take, some of which take you straight up the the cliff. Bring a backpack, water, and good hiking shoes, some spots are very slick and you will be hiking on a narrow pathway.', 'If this trail was safe, i would give it the full 5 stars! This is my favorite thing to do in San Diego, but that being said, it’s now pretty trafficked and at points, can be very sketchy/dangerous. It’s amazing terrain, beautiful views when you get towards the water, but some parts of it just aren’t meant for people to be going through. If you’re not experienced or don’t have good balance, I wouldn’t tell you not to do it, just to take caution! I’ve seen kids on this trial many times but they also have a low center of gravity and can fit through the tight spaces like the slot-canyon portion. Again, amazing, but just be cautious! Keep in mind, this is not the only way to get to blacks beach. And pro tip: barefoot is easier in this trail.', 'Short but sweet. Good for an evening outing. Leads right to the picturesque beach.', 'Short hike but well worth it for the views! There are some challenging spots so take your time on the trails. Will be doing this one again.', 'A lot of fun, for the whole family.  I took my 5 kids (ages 12 to 20 months).  Carried the little one but the others did fine.  Challenging for sure, and safe if you are smart and do not rush or try and blow past people.  There are slippery parts, and one part that gets pretty narrow.  We left very dirty, but the kids really enjoyed it and felt challenged.', ""I love this hike! challenging but fun. Beautiful from start to finish! I hiked the last half without shoes as it was very slippery but if you have good hiking shoes I'd reccomend wearing them. Stay safe."", ""I entered this trail through the top and parked in the neighborhood as opposed to the bottom. The entrance at the top can be very easily missed. I came here with a few friends and we're all moderately athletic and my friend brought her dog. I don't recommend this trail if your dog is not athletic. I was able to get through the trail ok but I wished I would've had better shoes as it can get slippery. You cross part of the trail on a plank and can be very intimidating. Another part of the trail you scale down on a rope, this is at the bottom of the trail, again I wish I would've had better shoes. Overall, this trail is amazing and you scale down through canyons and there's also a part of the trail where you can chill and it overlooks the entire beach. Do it!"", ""I was surprised by this Trail. I had done Annie's Trail north in Carlsbad along the cliffs from the beach. That was nothing like this one. You have to start out going up a rope to pull yourself up to the trail. And we asked people coming down the trail were there places that dropped off 50 to a hundred feet? They said yes there were but the trail at that point was 2 or 3 ft wide... easily accessible. They lied!!! There were parts that were just maybe 6 inches wide... with a toe hold you got across. I can see where people get stranded and need to be rescued out of there. There was even at two-by-four to walk across a gully. I would suggest if you are afraid of heights or you are not in good shape... this is not one for you."", 'Short trail to the beach. But very fun and pretty with the slot canyons', 'I love this trail for the sick slot canyon.  There are a couple different branches to take, and one of them you’re squeezing through this gorgeous, striated slot.  The colors are phenomenal, perfect for photography.  The trail is for sure challenging and slippery.  Recommend barefoot (for purchase on sand over stone) and all fours at some points.  I usually see people stuck and struggling.  Go slow and be prepared to fall.', '', 'A slippery little trail. Gorgeous views all the way down, though!', 'A little sketch but it makes it fun!', 'Very difficult and scary towards the end. Please only go if you’re experienced. My boyfriend and I had a moment where we thought we were going to fall to our deaths.', 'Very short but very fun!', 'This is a pretty fun trail but can be tough if the sand is dry and slippery', 'There’s naked people on the beach when you make it down there! Lol, I didn’t know I was hiking to a nude beach. Mostly men of course....anyway.... yes it’s very challenging and yes the locals go barefoot and say it’s safer. Awesome sandstone washouts and a rope to get you down the last 50. Head north on the beach and take the stairs back up, then head south along the ridge to get back to the original starting point.', 'Best trail in SD by far :) definitely a hidden gem', 'Scary but so worth it.', 'Beautiful, slightly out-of this-world trail for experienced risk takers.  Three very sketchy places where “horizontal” part is 1-2” wide and made of loose sand.  Cling to the wall with your belly but don’t grab what appears to be a good hold too hard – you may end up with a detached piece of sandstone in your hand.  Prayers won’t help traction – wear good shoes.  Although locals claim that doing it barefoot is the best (not for me).  Don’t start the 1st narrow part (either way you go) if not sure, you may find yourself in an impossible situation.  Consider yourself warned.', 'For locals only unless you are experienced! The path is eroding away, so hike at own risk! Have fun though!!', 'Has eroded a little bit since the last time I did it. Wear shoes with good traction!', 'It was such a beautiful view from top to bottom of the hike. But due to the rain and mud slides I would suggest waiting a week or so because my partner and I both slid down a few muddy hills...still worth it :-)', 'Challenging, but not strenuous at all. Mostly all downhill to the beach. We took our shoes off halfway because some parts of the trail are so sketchy that it was safer to walk through the water. You will slip at least once, with good shoes or no shoes. I would not want to hike back up this route and we did not—there’s a way to go back up via the main road.', 'Get off the beaten path and find the hidden goat trails. This is where you will get your sweat on. This is some serious sand stone no traction slip away from everything you step onto. Know your limitations!!!', ""Agree with those saying this trail can be risky at points.  It's not clear which is the best path to take at times as well but isn't that part of the fun. Do wear shoes with traction--i wore birkenstocks and slipped at several points.  My bad, of course, in not being prepared."", 'Definitely challenging, but completely worth it !', 'Absolutely adore it', 'Have to be careful but was a great little hike.', 'I loved this trail. It can be difficult in spots.  Wear good hiking shoes. The path is narrow and slippery in some places. The scenery is beautiful.', 'Kind of dangerous but definitely exciting. So different from the other hikes I had done before!', ""Beautiful views! A little narrow and on the edge at times. My husband and I wore tennis shoes and thought it helped. There's lose dirt through out the trail that can contribute to slipping so just be very careful. The view and the beach at the end is worth it."", 'Wear shoes with lots of tread, overall beautiful trail!', 'Although the scenery is very beautiful, due to the fact that this trail is not maintained, it has eroded and become dangerous at at least one point. It should be reclassified as ""difficult"" or removed from this list entirely. I myself slipped and almost fell into a ravine, hanging by one hand and luckily got pulled up by two other hikers before my arm gave way. If you must hike this trail, make sure you have hiking shoes or boots with very good traction.', 'Love love love ❤️', 'A very nice short hike! the beach is very peaceful and quiet. it is a challenge though so be prepared!', 'great trail through eroded sandstone Clif. Very difficult.', 'Great little trail. Very ""slippery"" from loose sand. Many people went barefoot. Hiking sandals would be best. Take your beach stuff and hang out at the beach for a while. We went around 1/2 and watched dolphins for about and hour. A quarter mile down is blacks beach/nude beach.', ""Beautiful hike for a beautiful day. The hike is definitely moderate and in some spots the trail is very narrow and scary. Cool to watch the hang gliders and all the nudists on the beach. Wear sunglasses or they may think you're staring :-P"", 'A hidden treasure, the view is amazing!!!  It is breathtaking.', 'short, but challenging along a heavily eroded path.', 'Very Fun trail! Some parts are much easier bare foot & the less you carry the better. Be sure to enjoy the beach at the end.', ""Honestly one of the best trails in San Diego. Got to catch the beautiful San Diego sunset. It's challenging if you can't step up too high, it's slippery because the sand is a little loose but it's not too challenging for a average afternoon hiker. A must go !!!"", ""This trail is definitely hard. I don't know how surfers carry their boards!! Very much worth the views and surf. The homes along this trail are fun to look at too. If you ever off to the right, going up hill provides great views, as noted by other users. I met two locals who said the trail is much more trafficked lately than in years past. The place was crawling with folks on a Saturday, but I had no trouble getting parking on the road. Google maps takes you to a large business building as the entrance - not where you want to be. Further south in the residential area is best to start at."", 'So much fun. Kinda rough on the way down, but totally worth it!', 'excellent ravine climb down towards the beach. some sandy rocks are quite smooth so take it slow and watch your step on the steeper downhills.', ""Definitely not a trail for the inexperienced or faint at heart hiker. I'd say heavily trafficked, maybe because it's Sunday. No signage at all makes it challenging to navigate. Two dead ends. Certainly not a trail for wet weather."", ""Awesome hike! Did this hike in a loop from the Torrey Pines Gliderport down to Black's Beach. It was muddy slippery at the beginning  and some steep parts and cool little waterfall in the beginning."", ""Best coastal hike in the county. Start from the Gliderport, not La Jolla Farms Road. The route across the top of the cliffs is more interesting, before it cuts left and heads down through a sandstone slot canyon all the way down to the beach below. This isn't for children or dogs, all sorts of sketchy and precarious situations on this trek. Good balance and good traction footwear is a must. Watch your step!"", ""Went on a gloomy Tuesday in June with a cousin. Referred to Venessa's review before the hike. We took the surfer path to the beach. There is a point in the path where it looks like you either go up a slope to the left or go down into areas between the rocks to the right. The area inbetween the rocks do not continue into a path, so, go up the slope, lol. There are small streams that you follow until you reach an area with a rope you use as you walk down a decline that leads to the beach. This part was wet when I went down it, and the mud was slippery, but its not a too difficult part of the trail.After reaching the beach, we walked to the left to see the Pavilion guest house, aka Mushroom house. Then took the UCSD road up to our car instead of hiking back through the trails. Got a good view of the houses in the neighborhood this way. Really wouldn't recommend going if it has just rained because the mud is no joke. I would probably do it again, but on a sunnier day."", ""This trail is tricky and footwork is spotty in several places, but that's what makes it fun. The lower left trail leads to the beach and I recommend finding a path that stays on the ledges until you reach the slot canyon. Plant your feet well!\n\nNote that the beam in the pictures actually bends slightly, which will throw your balance off if you don't expect it. Climbing up and down next to it is an easy alternative.\n\nThe trail on the right leads to the top, which also involves some slippery spots in order get onto, but you'll be fine. Take some pictures and enjoy the view!"", ""Simply an access trail to the beach. Defiantly not the safest way down there.  But it's not terrifying as I'd been warned. Don't take any children,  you have to repell down a skimpy rope at the end to traverse a steep little sea cliff and there are deep trenches that you can't see down to the bottom of."", ""This hike was much better than expected. And! there is free 2hr parking throughout the neighborhood. You'll find the trail in between the fences...Further down, At the fork, The surfers take the lower left trail barefoot to the beach. It's still pretty tough especially with a surf board in your hand. But if you go right it takes you up into the cliffs. Their are dangerous ledges without a railing and slippery sandy slopes so I wouldn't recommend taking small children. There is a lot of damage to the terrain because of water run off. We recommend going up first. You can take the ledges all the way to Torrey Pines park (Just follow the paragliders) and down the broken staircases to Blacks beach-(Some peeps at the beach may be nude). We walked the beach back towards the trail where the surfers come out at (on the lower trail) and went back up that way. It's beautiful. Small waterfalls, streams and even a small slot canyon. This hike has everything from amazing ocean views to the beautiful greenery and even amazing rocks that give the feel of being in Zions National Park. We would definitely do this one again and bring everyone that will come! It's A perfect spot to watch the sunset."", 'The trailhead for this is between two really nice houses, and it took me a while to find because I was wary of trespassing. The trail itself is pretty, well trafficked, and short, but involves some tricky footwork. I would not take small children on this trail', ""A short trail with some sketchy, slippery spots that could potentially spell trouble if you're not careful with your steps. But it's a fun and a bit challenging one ."", 'Loved the view and the trail. My kids went with me made mea little nervous in a couple of spots but they loved it and had so much fun.Initially the trail was a little hard to spot as it is a small trail in the middle of residential homes.', 'Great trail! Parking is 2 hours in a residential area.', 'SO much fun! Little slippery because of the sand, so be careful. Not for anyone afraid of getting dirty, or afraid of heights. Some tight squeezes. Be careful!!!', 'cool trail, watch your step.', ""Sweet hike. This isn't your typical hike, it's fairly short but with a much more demanding terrain. There was a few spots that could spell trouble for people who aren't in great shape, have bad balance or whom are even very careless. If you take your time, take deliberate movements and are in decent shape, you'll LOVE this hike! The end point leads you directly onto the beach - a great place to hang out, skip some rocks or even take a dip!PS: You can get some breathtaking photos if you are interested in that."", 'Short and sweet. A bit tough in areas you have to balance or climb, but not sure if this was because I went post rain and some of the support was washed away and slippery. Either way, it was a very exciting adventure.', ""This is one of my favorite trails In San Diego. Especially in the spring time. It's not long, it is breathe taking, it is unordinary, and there is flowers everywhere!!! (Spring time)"", 'Nice short hike, but definitely proved to be a challenge for sure.', ""Very fun and pretty difficult trail. I highly recommend waiting at least a week after it rains to hike this trail because it's already pretty slippery on a normal day. Make sure to wear shoes with good tread, and be prepared to get a little dirty!"", ""There is no ho chi minh trail. Pro-communists want to put this murderer's name everywhere. Please take this off the map."", ""Loved it. I didn't think it was hard. Maybe moderate."", ""Loved it. I didn't think it was hard. Maybe moderate."", ""Amazing hike and you can extend it past the .5 miles that is documented in the description. It's pretty easy but if you do the whole thing it's a great challenge. Highly recommend doing the full thing. I go year round! Don't forget this is blacks beach and it's a nude friendly establishment."", 'Very fun hike but also very short. Very beautiful views from the top and also the bottom. Beach is very secretive which makes it relaxing.', ""I did this hike after some rainfall so it was extremely muddy and slippery. It definitely made it challenging but it's a great way to get down to the beach at the end."", 'Awesome trail! My 3 kids had a blast and were fully able to complete with little assistance. Slick at the end, but 100% manageable.', ""Nice entrance to Black's Beach, but not quite long enough to call a trail."", 'love it', 'Fun little hike that is challenging with amazing views at the top! Worth climb up the cliffs to the right before going down to the beach. Barefoot works best on the slippery sandy rocks!', 'A fun, but short hike. You get the slot Canyon feeling but just enough to tease you. The board you cross in the beginning is fun and it has beautiful plants. The tall cliff are breath taking and there are many more trails there to explore near by. We even got to see a Peregrine falcon! Finding this trail is half the fun! Be observant!', ""This is a trail that people use to get down to the beach. It's a relatively easy trail, but with real sketchy spots that could spell trouble if you are not careful. There is one part where you have to cross a wooden plank, other parts where you can easily fall down to the side and into a ravine, and at the end their is a rope to get yourself down.

May want to bring gloves as there is a ton of bouldering to be had.', 'Had a lot of fun here! Went towards the end of the day to catch the evening light for pictures, stayed until after dark to catch the stars. Family friendly with a lot of rocks to climb on. We did walk up on a good size rattle snake, we gave it its space and each party went their separate ways.', 'Nice to get off the trail and explore the rock formations. Not crowded at all since it was over 100°F!', ""If you like bouldering and lots of people around check out this tail. The rock formations are beautiful,  but challenging and abrasive to navigate.  We didn't hike the whole loop,  but spent about 30 minutes here before venturing on to Lost Horse Mine and Ryan Mtn trails."", 'Beautiful, easy hike. Just wish it was a bit more off the road. I always see chuckwallas and last time a 4 foot diamondback', ""Worth doing along with the other loop around there. Not great but it's giving you a good feel of this area, and it's fairly short"", 'Honestly, I think the skull rock is the only interesting rock on this trail, but the only one worth five stars.', 'Definitely more “touristy” due to the short length and ease of the hike, but still fun to see. Would recommend doing this either earlier or later in the day to beat or follow the crowds as there is sometimes some congestion around Skull Rock. Climbing on the surrounding rocks is fun and a good way to get away from some of the people in the trail.', 'This was probably my sons favorite trail as there were so many cool rock formations to climb. To get the full loop you hike into Jumbo Rocks campground and head toward the main road. You catch the last part of the loop on the opposite side of the road. Don’t miss this part of the loop! It’s super cool terrain!', 'So cool!! We had a great time walking along the trail and watching others climb the rocks.', 'You can see Skull Rock without doing the hike since it can be seen from the road (Park Blvd) and you can park on the side of the road and walk less than 50 ft to reach it.  I used the All Trails app and did the loop hike which is 1.7 miles if you stay on the trail but it is hard to resist going off trail to explore the boulders and check out the views from the tops of the boulders you are comfortable climbing.  Our hike ended up being about 2.1 miles RT.  We then drove to the start of the Split Rock trail but that is so close that you could go do that loop without even driving since it is right next to Skull Rock.', 'This was a short easy trail, suitable for families with small children.  Which there were quite a few just climbing and playing on the rocks.  Skull rock is pretty cool to see in person and worth stopping by to snap a couple pictures with it.', 'Pretty little nature trail with signs describing the plants. Perfect for families, but a bit too over crowded for me! Great spot for some rock scrambling, though.', 'Nice easy trail. The road/campground part was a little boring and not well marked.', 'More of a view', 'Nice trail, beautiful views of the rock formations in JTNP. Good for families.', 'Short nature walk, good for almost all skill levels.  The trail is a little tricky where it crosses the road (not super well marked), but the skull rock at the end is pretty cool', ""Skull Rock was very cool to see in person. If you don't feel like doing the 1.7 mile hike you can park along side the rock on the main road and walk up."", 'The rocks are crazy big here but rough on your hands.

We have 5 small children under 10 and really enjoy this hike.', 'we looked for an easy hike for my son and this fit the bill. however, the trail was very poorly marked and seemed to go to nowhere. too many people letting their dogs off leash, which i am not a fan of for multiple reasons. this was the disney version of a joshua tree hike. hard pass.', '#tu', 'Excellent place for boulder hopping', ""Fun little hike. I wouldn't recommend only doing the trail. Step off jump around and rock hop a little bit. It's such a great area to play freely and enjoy the massive beauty around you."", 'Very nice and well marked trail. Many places to climb and take in the desert views which are just incredible.', 'This trail is easy, and after walking out to skull rock, I climbed around and explored all of the rocks behind it and around it for a few hours.', 'We saw a desert mouse and a family of quails on this trail! Lots of places to climb and veer off the path.', '', ""Very cute place to watch the sunset with your SO on top of the rocks. The trail was pretty but I wouldn't go on it again."", ""The trail is an easy hike with a well marked trail. Takes you by a lot of the wildflowers that are blooming now. I'm not sure there was anything to cause me to want to do it again. You can park at skull rock and walk a short distance to see the same things and simply walk back the couple hundred feet."", ""Took the dogs which you're not supposed to in some areas so that can be challenging. It's not so much a hike to skull rock just a walk but usually a lot of traffic for photo opps depending on when you go."", 'simple hike right off the road that you can do quickly.  It gets a bit confusing because part of the hike goes through the campgrounds and is not marked well.great wildflowers in the spring.', 'We parked at the camp ground just south of the trail. Nice loop with lots of interpretive signs and great views of the jumbo rocks! Bring water! There are bathroom s but only near the campgrounds.', 'Nice loop, suites perfectly for families.', 'Easy hike', 'Easy, scenic, and lots of little tif bits of information along the way', 'Great fun scaling the rocks and boulders.', 'Love the rocks shapes and the beautiful colors!', 'Went camping therefor the first just before Thanksgiving and did a few trails and this was one of them. I was amazed at the beauty of this place. This trail was very easy and a lot of fun. I stayed at the Jumbo Rocks Campground and the trail heads are by the front entrance or inside the campground itself. If you plan on camping there at this time be ready to fight for a spot because it gets very crowded and fills up fast.', 'A very well maintained and marked trail with interpretive markers along the way.', 'Fun with the kids, beautiful scenery, several spots to roam of the beaten path.', 'Good trail and even better climbing around in the rocks. Bring gloves of you want to amble through the rocks...the stuff is like granite or something.', 'I did this trail at night with some friends. Very fun! Be sure to keep an eye on the trail if you go at night. Once you start exploring its very hard to find your way back. Took lots of great pictures of the stars!', 'Hiked very near to this area.  One of the most fun hikes we had in Joshua Tree.  There were so many rock scrambles and formations that we felt energized and just kept exploring and climbing.  Saw lots of birds, Juniper berries, varied cacti, lizards, and of course the photography here is outstanding.  Go off trail--so much to see and so many little surprises around each bend!', 'Skull Rock is actually just barely off the campground road. Interesting rock formations. But, the most fun is going off the trail and playing on the rocks. Wish we had more time!  Fun!', 'This is a fun trail, very easy and well maintained.  The most fun comes when you go off trail just a hair and climb some of the wild rock formations all around these parts.  My grandson and I spend hours at a time at the Jumbo Rocks/Skull Rock area and never cease to have a blast.  There are rock formations for any climbing ability, and by just going off trail just a little, you can really feel like you are lost out there.  One of my favorite places to go.', 'Fun for all ages!', ""This is a very easy hike that shows some amazing rock formations and some beauty of Joshua tree national park. The trail head starts in the middle of Jumbo rocks campground and go to skull rock, cross the road and continue on the loop back to the road at the main entrance to jumbo rocks. Took my 6 & 8 year olds and they loved it. Lots of birds, butterfly's, bees, flowers and lizards. "", 'Skull Rock and Jumbo Rocks are two more highly popular scenic attractions in Joshua Tree National Park. This super short 1.7 mile hike (2 miles if you wander through the campground like we did), is another must-do hike for anyone wanting to soak in the majesty of Joshua Tree. It’s easily reachable from the park’s northern Loop Road, and is engaging enough even for young kids — particularly with all the cool rocks to climb. (Date hiked February 18, 2013.)

Once your at Skull Rock though, running around and climbing on all the rocks is pretty awesome, so its a place worth visiting. If you have other places to go, though, I'd say that driving there and hiking somewhere else is worth your time and energy."", 'The loop trail starts and finish at the skull rock campground. The trail is mostly flat and pretty easy but the beauty of joshua tree is the opportunity to go off trail, climb random rocks, and explore all the little places you find interesting along the way!', 'The trail is labeled ""split rock trail"" and it\'s a loop trail. It\'s a fairly easy hike. I did this with my husband & daughters (ages 6 & 12). There are picnic tables at the trailhead. We had a small picnic after our hike. It was nice. The trail is not overpopulated & there\'s plenty to see along the way. We stopped several times along the way to look at the different rock formations and say what we thought they looked like ... like passing clouds. There are signs to the ""face rock"" which is about 0.1 miles off the main trail. It\'s worth the short walk. There are signs off the split rock trail that split to ""eagle cliff trail"" ... we followed it out of curiosity & it led us to nowhere! It\'s also a more difficult trail than ""split rock trail"" .... I don\'t recommend the eagle cliff trail. But I highly recommend the Split Rock trail ... It was a unique & fascinating experience. ', 'got to the trail first thing in the AM. i was the first one there at around 7:30. some cool rock formations, including the skull rock. the trail is relatively easy. after checking out the skull

Check the tide so you get there around low tide to take advantage of the tide pools.', 'Peaceful and easy beach stroll!', 'Beautiful & peaceful!  And lunch @ the date shake shake a tasty bonus!', 'Beautiful views of the ocean, but also the street. Nice easy walk great for kids.', 'Easy beautiful trail, part goes on a paved road, the other part is on the beach which is a good balance. Parking rate Mon-Fri after 5 pm - $3.', ""I didn't do quite this exact trails, but very similar. We started at the Los Trancos parking lot ($15), crossed PCH and took the paved path down to the side of the golf course. This part of the hike up on the cliff has some pretty views and lots of bathrooms along the way. There are plenty of spots to head down to the beach, but if you keep walking until you get to the golf course before you head down, you can see the cool Monterey Formation geological features and explore your first batch of tidepools! From there, we walked along the beach, peering into tidepools and crossing over some rocks along the way. Make sure you go at low tide to be able to cross all of this, or you may have to head back up to the cliffside and take a different beach access point down. We head down the beach until we just passed the Historic District and Beachcombers, stopped to look at the tidepools there, but honestly, got annoyed with the OC crowd (everyone was complaining really loudly about absolutely everything!), so we headed up the stairs in the Historic District, walked back along the cliffs back to Los Trancos. \n\nA nice little beach walk, not strenuous at all. Got sweaty at the end as the morning started to heat up, but overall a very easy hike! (No dogs allowed! We saw one lady with her dog up top, but there are signs at all the beach access points that say no dogs.)"", 'I did this trail in the late morning into the afternoon with plans to stop at the Beachcomber for lunch halfway through. It definitely took longer than expected to get midway but well worth the wait. If you want to do the same bring a back pack with a bathing suit and cover up and a credit card, so you can enjoy the restaurant/bar and lay on the beach. However I should have ate less at the restaurant because the steep hill shortcut back to where we parked the car was not ideal on a full stomach. We ran out of time and had to cut the rest of the hike short. Overall, gorgeous views and a nice breeze. But definitely not “easy.” I would say easy/moderate. I didn’t realize the lower part of the trail is on the actual sand. Walking on the sand isn’t easy in my opinion. But a nice change of pace from your run of the mill dirt road trail. Also there are plenty of bathrooms which is nice.', 'Beautiful view! I went yesterday with my husband to see the sunrise around )5:20am) and was worth it. Quit, peaceful and with a great great view. I also enjoyed staying down the beach after jogging in the trail, was so romantic.Best time to go is before the sun come out to avoid the hit ! Highly recommended', 'Nice views. Very warm on the trails and on the beach.', 'The beach was very pretty and there was a lot of interesting rocks at the reef point area that resembled the millennium falcon. In the tide pool area there were an abundance of crabs, alive and dead. It’s a good walk for people who like the beach and some history.', 'This is a long walk, top half is paved or wood planks. Bottom is the beach.. sand and at the end of the loop rocks.  I enjoyed myself and it was not challenging.  Parking is $5 an hour or $15 for the day. For the four miles with a few stops it was just under two hours. I think of myself as a slow walker. Oh and there are three spots of stairs.', 'The kids love this trail because we always go down to the tide pools but down by the beach there are no restrooms and the walk up back to the blacktop trail is steep so prepare ahead.', 'Beautiful beach and coastline views-', 'Very easy trail with a beautiful view of the beach.', 'Simple hike yet gorgeous walking along the ocean. No crowds on Christmas made it even better. We brought my 3-month old niece along for the walk and she as zero complaints. $15 for parking is a little steep, but I guess it helps keep the park clean and crowds a little smaller.', 'Very relaxing hike!', 'Nice walk, beach and nature, followed by lunch at the beachcomber restaurant.', 'Great trail!', 'Great trail! BEAUTIFUL!', 'We parked at reed point and started the bluff trail. I wish we would had gone down to the beach straght away. The upper trail is black top and hot. The beach is great. The sand is hard so walking in shoes or hiking boots like us is fine. Plenty of rocks in the water to explore at low tide. walk done to Crystal cove and have lunch on the beach at the Beachcomber. Good food. In between access to the beach there is very few people, you have the beach to yourself. Great day', 'So pretty with tide pools', 'great', 'fun and easy', ""Great route for kids.  Especially with the destination being a strawberry shake at Ruby's."", ""This was a beautiful beach to visit everything in nature was perfect my only complaints were they charge you $15 to park and the showers don't even work so you have to brush the sand off of yourself in the bathroom it sounds like a whole Lotta nothing for $15 and the tunnel leading to the beach was poorly maintained"", 'Great beach hiking!', 'Great views and easy hike. If you want a challenge go down each of the beach access trails and hike up. Bathroom access and The Beachcomber is there to quench your thirst.', 'Loved it. Nice work out if you add the stairs and ramps.', ""This is a fun easy hike along the coast for just a get outside and enjoy God's creation kind of day!!"", 'my family and I had a blast...', 'took the strenuous route. a lot of hills at the beginning and then we get to ""the elevator""   made it up and the views were beautiful.', 'Was a nice, hilly scenic walk.

Be sure to explore all of the rocks! there are some really neat shapes and patterns.', 'Not really a hike, it was a nice easy walk along the shoreline.

Signs indicated we were at the point but could continue on to Auburn Rec Staging Area (another 1.3 miles). We opted to just turn around there. Minimal climbing on this hike. It was just ok. Wished it was longer. Per my calculations it doesn’t add up to the 5 miles I thought I read it was. Non the less it was an easy lazy Sunday afternoon stroll.', 'amazing hike, minimal traffic', 'Amazing trail. Highly recommended for those looking to build speed and gives amazing scenic views.', 'Happy 4th Hike. It was a good trail. Lots of poison oak on either side. Most of the trail is wide but there are areas that are single track.  Didn’t see any water fails but did pass over a few very minor streams.', 'Great hike! I took my dog for a nice long walk today, it was fun to explore all the trails, weather was perfect, cool breeze kept us from sweating too much. Take lots of water!', 'Nice wide trail to walk on and to move outta the way if you do see people, bikes, or horses. The up and down of the hills helps work a variety of muscles so no single group feels overworked. I had to take a few breaks to catch my breath going up on a couple but it was easy most of the time. It’s beautiful and peaceful. We found old foundation where a settlement used to be about a mile in to the right before you get to the fork to Rattlesnake Bar. Lots a poison oak all around the trails so be on the lookout.', 'Easy nice trail. The trail itself isn’t too long but does lead to many other trails.', 'Parking was easy and free, so that’s a good way to start things off! The trail was pretty easy to maneuver, and is pretty neat in the early morning. Later in the morning, I noticed a lot more trail runners and other people (not a bad thing at all, just an observation). I will say the views are pretty killer for a fairly short hike. Also, if you are in it for fitness reasons the last 1/4 mile is a good leg burner!

Great day hike.', 'Bring $10 for the Auburn State Rec Area park/ing fees!Would not really advise doing this trail in the middle of summer as there\'s not much shade cover and it\'s super hot and dusty. The ""end"" point is pretty anti-climactic (think you just hit a ""no entry"" point) - we tried to take a different route down that ended up being super steep and had to crab-crawl down at some points, so make sure you have the right shoes for it if you want to try that.', ""Good hike with lots of different trails. We started in a residential lot (kind of got lost here) and ended up finding the fire trail and taking it to the bridge trail. 80% of the hike was in the sun, but other than that the trail was wide and nice view of water. Didn't go past the bridge though. Solid 2 hours exploring here"", 'Great hike and was definitely a bit of a challenge, mostly downhill on the way out but the way back was mostly uphill so just be prepared. There are a lot of turn offs, so it was really helpful to have the map open on AllTrails to keep to the main route. However, you can make the trail all your own by taking different turns. Was mostly shaded and had some nice views. We found a little turn off that led us to a bench and had a great view of the river. Bring water!', ""The hike was beautiful!! There wasn't that many people but the people we did see were very nice and helpful:) the waterfall wasn't super big but it still was breathtaking to see, some advice would be to bring lots of water and be prepared for and uphill walk on the way back.

The hike back around mile 1.8 got difficult going back UP!!Luckily, this part of the trail is shaded so there was plenty opportunity to rest (catch breathe) before moving on.

I recorded it on dual apps at 5.75 miles each way (11.5 miles from Murphy\'s gate to the Cool fire station and back. Although I\'m not typically a fan of out and back hikes, the sun sat low in the sky, so it seemed like two completely different hikes coming and going. The winter weather was perfect and there was plenty of water flow in the river and waterfalls due to the recent rains.\n\nYou can expect to see plenty of hikers with dogs, along with many trail runners. The trail today was extremely muddy after passing ""No Hands"" Bridge - I\'d highly recommend having hiking shoes/boots instead of running shoes or sneakers after the bridge. I should note that once you break off the main trail heading down to the RR bridge there were a few very steep/muddy sections where it was obvious a few people had slipped. Take it slow and you should be ok. Overall, it was a great hike with a lot of options for those who may want more of a workout with very steep hills (Pig Farm Trail, training hill, etc.). I did this hike on Jan 10, and still needed plenty of water. Enjoy!', 'Beautiful! Definitely one of the best hikes we have done! We did .6 from parking to fork in the path and decided to walk down the RR bridge trail 2.2 miles. Beautiful waterfall and wood bridge to cross . We walked across the RR bridge and took one of the really narrow paths down towards the water, we ended up making our own little path down to the rocks for the dogs to get into the water. Probably around .7 from the RR bridge. And then we hiked back the same way we came in. I would rate this trail as moderate, the hike back from RR bridge is uphill a nice work out! Careful on the narrow paths across the RR bridge some are very narrow and slippery, I fell ;) (more than once)', 'Easy with a great view.', 'Awesome little trail. We had 10dogs with us and it was a breeze. Loved the views and wild life!', 'Lots of downhill at first, nice views of the river below.', ""The fire break was cleared in the last 6 months which makes much of this wide trail exposed. I don't enjoy it on very hot days for this reason. That said- this trailhead leads to infinite other trails (some marked, some not) and it's a great place to become familiar with. We've never run out of parking. From here you can connect with the Western States trail heads and others. At least two bears in residence. Wild blackberries and flowers."", 'A great wide trail and a few nice waterfalls depending on the time of year.   The farther you hike the less people you see.   Water is fantastic but arrive early for a good parking spot.', 'The main trail is pretty wide and nicely graded.  My group took some of the side trails down to the river which were more of a moderate level due to inclines.  Overall, there were some scenic places and photo opportunities along the way.  The river is still pretty cold and not very full, but fast in places, so be careful if you want to swim/wade.', 'I enjoyed this hike. Nice wide trails most of the way. Places to swim too. Over all a fun work out and beautiful wild flowers!', ""My husband and I took this trail today and enjoyed some detours.  We hiked a total of 4.5-5 miles total and found some great smaller trails.  The main trail is a fire break and a bit more like a road in it's width.  Lots of nice shady part of the trail and it was great to see the remnants of the old incomplete Auburn Damn.    Unfortunately, with the drought, there is very little water in the river so the view is fairly unimpressive and limited.  I think it would be a great river trail during non-drought times.  Overall we really enjoyed the hike and we enjoyed some good exercise from the variety of terrain."", 'Is took my 7 and 9 year old daughters. We had a blast hiking to the river. Beware though... There are a few nude sun bathers out there.', 'Easy trail with some nice views of the river.

However I must warn you to watch out for ticks!!! My dog was infested with them by the time we left there!

We went down to the rail road bridge and the river and hiked back up. River was very refreshing and saw some people bring their water tubes and were going down the river. Shaded for about 50% of the trail and it was a hot day (100 almost). Should definitely check it out. Good for beginners and moderate hikers.\n\nMy friend also brought his siberian husky along and saw many other dogs in the trail.', 'Awesome! Beautiful views and fun:)', '**Dog and Kid friendly** I hiked this in a large group with kids. We ended up hiking 6.5 miles, first around the loop and then down 2 miles to the river and back up to firebreak trail and back to the cars parked on HWY 49. It was a lovely hike. Our youngest hiker was 7 years old and she did very well. There were a few horses on the trail that spooked my dog, so be sure to follow the leash rules when hiking with your dog. The river was gorgeous and well worth the scenic hike. Dog poo bags were available at the Robie point gate trail head on HWY 49. Very useful.', 'We had a great time with our 2 1/2 year old on this trail. Our son even got to walk about a mile of it which was nice! It was very easy and perfect for me being 6 months pregnant!', 'Nice hike.

It's was nothing to difficult. Nice for any family to go on or those who want to start hiking I'd recommend this one. Has a lot of side trials and road that you could further explore. Overall had a good time with nice views."", ""Great views along the way good for beginners and dogs. Unfortunately there aren't many places that I found at the river to rest except for a small beach. To get to it, go left on the trails when you get to river level and follow that down through the sand with the reeds growing out of it. After about 150 ft, you'll reach the beach.

The oak creek babbles it’s way to the San Diego River watershed.  It’s quite a joy to see the small waterfalls in action.', 'Very beautifully preserved area! Easy hike/walk. Plenty of dogs!', 'A really mild, relaxing hike! There is plenty of nature and rolling hills to see. Not much incline, and there is a pond at the base of the hike!', ""Today about 8:30-8:45 am, my 14-year-old son and I were in Oak Canyon South (just a bit beyond the first bridge after the Grasslands junction) when we encountered a pack (5-6) of large coyotes. Two crossed immediately (about 5 feet) in front of my son, going into the brush on our left side, while the rest of them were above us on the right side. One of these stood looking down at us. I was surprised that they didn't seem afraid of us, so to be on the safe side we backtracked out of the trail. It was a cool experience, but unnerving at the time. I enjoy this trail and we will be back."", 'Uneventful hike.', 'Very pretty and very easy. Perfect for kids.', 'This is a short, fun but rocky trail.... I will return after a  good rain so I can see the water flowing!', 'Don’t overlook the easy trails if it is beautiful scenery that you seek! I got some really dope pics here. This trail was peaceful on a weekday morning and I found the solitude that I was craving.', ""Extremely crowded trail but I still agree that it's a nice hike.  Not a good one with the dog if you have a nervous dog like mine."", 'Nice mix of easy walking and some inclines. There wasn’t much water throughout but the beautiful rock formations and variety of flat open spaces and bush laden trails was totally worth it! While there were a fair amount of folks at the trail, the space is large enough that it was still peaceful.', 'This is NOT even close to 6 miles. It was 4 for me, but I included a long walk down Father Junipero Serro road. How strange! This is definitely an easy hike and pretty dry right now :/ The oaks are always fun to walk under and the rocky areas are worth climbing. Not my favorite hike ... but it’s local. I added the screenshot of the miles in the photo section (if anyone was curious)', ""It says it is 6.8 miles but I didn't get that many miles when I did the trail.

Today was the first time on this trail❤️', 'Poor !', 'Nice walk along wooded creek. Vegetation, flowers and breeze are nice.  Caution:  Trail that parallels Hwy 52 is actually an unimproved 4WD trail that is much more vertical up and down than contour intervals indicate.  Loose rocks and steepness make hike more than a little challenging.', 'There was a good variety of trails of varying length and difficulty level. The river area was amazing. The wildflowers were beautiful. I would avoid this hike in the summer.  Be aware that the long paved path (Father Junipera Serra) does not lead to the better elements of the hike.', 'Fun trail this time of year with flowing water down the canyon and lots of wildflowers (and a couple of rattlesnakes, so beware).  Distance is not 6.8--it is more like 3,5 from this starting point, at most.  Fun hike', 'Great little trail.. really nice with the sounds of rushing water and birds chirping', ""This is a scenic hike that's easy so it's great for beginners. It starts at Old Mission Dam and the creek running alongside Oak Canyon Trail adds to to scenery of the hike."", ""Beautiful hike! Easy trail but watch for trail markers. You could easily go off on one of the other trails/loops if you are not paying attention or know where you are going. You can hear the creek water the whole first half of the hike. :) I'm not sure why it says it is a 6.8 mile hike.

I was surprised to find multiple water falls along this hike.  At the end is a nice little 10 foot waterfall to hang out by. Do it!', ""Really lovely hike... We stopped underneath the highway and walked back the way we came in - out and back.

wed in all around and a bright and sunny day. Very beautiful walk with utter silence due to low tourist numbers. Loved it.', 'Great fishing for big German brown trout.', 'really beautiful!! This was an easy and crazy pretty hike. We also hiked around the lake --the far end of the lake was a little interesting to work through, not many people go up there, so the trail is really thin, you kind of push through branches, but the beginning and end of the circle was awesome.', 'Uphill for awhile but the lake is beautiful with the fall colors behind', 'Beware 2 mile drive on dirt road before you begin hiking, but well worth it, for this short, beautiful hike! You have all variety of trees  from juniper trees, aspens and then pine and grand views on walk back of Mono Lake.', 'Beautiful trail with awesome views of Mono Lake. We encountered some snow showers along the way in late April.', 'Great hike and great views. You can see Mono lake perfectly. A lot of the trail follows the stream which is a nice treat.. My family and I really enjoyed this hike. I would say that this hike has moderate traffic. We did see a lot of people and the parking lot was full. It is a must though if your in this area..', 'Lake views are amazing. Easy hike.', 'A little climb for 35 mins. Great Lake awesome views. Nice treat', 'Easy trek up to Parker Lake.  Today it was warm enough to take a swim, but I was not prepared.  This hike is not ""lightly trafficked"" though.  It was the second busiest hike (next to Devils Postpile/Rainbow Falls) I\'ve done all week.  I passed 100 people at least and they were in big groups.  Lots of dogs and kids.  Good family hiking.', ""An easier hike to help to get used to the elevation. The lake at the end is beautiful and very cold, I can't believe my dog actually swims in it."", 'Poor. Wind was high and the stream yielded no fish. The hike itself was beautiful and worth the effort. I would not rate it as easy but more moderate. It was approximately 4.5 miles in and out.', 'A nice lake hike. The trailhead is easy to get to via a gravel road. As you go up the hill you see a lot of different types of terrain and the diversity of the trail is one of the benefits. The lake is really, really pretty.  On Memorial Day weekend the trail had quite a few people on it.  Make sure to bring your camera.', ""Amazing hike! One of the most beautiful trails I've ever been on. Slight incline at the beginning but the views are worth it! Very windy when we went so bring layers. Great places along the creek to stop for lunch. Dog friendly too!"", 'Nice hike with beautiful views.', 'Great day hike with pup', ""We did this hike as they others we planned were still snowed in (end of March).   Happy they were, beautiful hike.  Little tricky on some steep areas covered in snow and ice but that's more die to the season.  We were the ONLY people on the trail.  Start in the desert with Mono to your back and end in this pristine lake surrounded by trees and snow covered mountains.   Stunning hike!"", 'Great short hike. Uphill for 1st bit, then easy from there. The lake is beautiful and we really enjoyed it! Good for beginners', 'Beautiful trail! First 15 uphill and then it flattens out with Parker crk running alongside, luring you on. Aspen and windflowers were beautiful. Lake was lovely. Even jumped in!', 'Very easy and short.  Great views at the start and end of hike.  Well worth it.', 'Pleasant little hike.  Great views of Mono Lake and Mono Craters on the way up.', 'Great hike', 'Great hike, first part steep then mainly levels out.  Very pretty through the Aspens along side the creek.  The lake is beautiful.  Good fishing as well!', ""The hike was all up hill for the first 700 or so feet, lucky for us there were spots of shade to break for water, (we hiked this trail at noon). Once you get past the elevation gain it's a pretty easy hike, flat terrain for the most part, a few gentle hills, meadows, creek rushing past you to the side, lots of photo opportunities....then it opens up to a breathtaking Parker Lake! Had lunch at the lake and met other hikers that had braved the cold water and gone swimming, others were fishing or having their lunch....gorgeous area with views of a couple of waterfalls, wish visitors would take their trash out with them rather than leave it around the lake edge though. I recommend taking at least 3 liters of water per hiker for a day hike and a trash bag to pickup after those that neglect the beauty of our wilderness!"", 'great hike to get you going in the morning. beautiful views. took my girlfriend and my dog and everyone had a great time. plan on going back for an overnight stay later in the summer.', 'One of the most beautiful lakes in an area full of them.

Also you get stunning views of the Mono basin there and back.', 'Great hike, at 68 years old I would rate it moderate/easy', ""Great views going back to trailhead of Mono Lake and Mono Craters. The lake is beautiful with glacier filled water and majestic mountain peaks behind. Little bit of a climb as mentioned in the other reviews but nothing strenuous if you're in decent shape."", 'Fantastic easy hike, terrific views, low crowds, and great destination. See pictures.

I am always on the lookout for a hike that the whole family can finish, and this one fit the bill.  My kids (ages 5, 7, and 9) were all able to finish this hike (with plenty of breaks and food).  There was much more uphill climbing than I expected- but I probably would not have noticed if it weren't for the kiddos."", ""This is an uphill hike almost all of the way. I don't mean to contradict Ellis~ but I did this hike just 3 days ago and my glutes are still feeling it! It was so beautiful, the scenery of course is spectacular! You will cross the creek in 3 places, so serene, listening to the water flow and the trees blowing in the wind. The trail is very rocky for about the first 1/2, then the crushed granite is underfoot most of the way after that. Lots of 'stair stepping', so bring your walking stick!!"", 'I have hiked this trail many times. It is easy/moderate with only climbing at the beginning and half way point to Parker Lake. The route is through scrub grass initially, then meadows and Aspen trees, always paralleling Parker Creek that you hear to your right as you moderately ascend. You encounter on the right the creek with a beautiful forest and trees to sit on across the creek for a break and the beauty, For serious hikers there is a second lake trail that intersects and is an additional 4 miles. Continuing through Aspen groves, you reach Parker Lake, one of the most beautiful lakes in the Sierras.
