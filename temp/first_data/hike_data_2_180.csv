', 'I don’t know why people were saying this trail isn’t easy. I don’t hike all that often, and while it was lengthy for time spent on your feet, it certainly isn’t strenuous. I went the direction of Sunset to Cinderella (counterclockwise). This way had a lot of downhill toward the end which was slippery and no fun if you have bad knees. I recommend maybe going the other direction (clockwise). You may get a little more uphill workout but then it will chill out. A small window of views of the bay, but that’s it. Otherwise just a pretty trail. 85% shade. Went at 1:30pm on a Monday. Few families with dogs and a few bikers, nothing crazy. Enjoyed it overall!', 'It said easy so I wore normal shoes and slipped several times on steep rocky downhill areas. It’s also super dusty because of all the mountain bikes, so instead of looking at green foliage it’s all brown.', ""I'm rating this trail 1 star because it is definitely not an easy trail. If you're a novice you won't like this trail. Definitely a beautiful hike but this trail has 100s of mountain bikers on it. I had to move around 50 times out of the way of mountain bikers. There were areas on the trail only 2 feet wide where you have to make room for mountain bikes moving at 25 mph. This trail is not KID FRIENDLY like suggested above. Steep hills with unsafe conditions. I went with my sister and towards the end of the trail we saw a family approaching the trail and urged then to turn around. We warned them that it wasn't safe for kids. Out of control mountain bikers make this trail uncomfortable and nerve recking during tight quarters. It's a beautiful trail that should be dedicated to either hiking or mountain biking, not both. I'm not a rookie hiker. I've been on over 100 hikes from this all trails app"", 'Great Hike!', 'Nice scenic trail', 'This was a nice trail it is moderate and be prepared to go off trail for Cinderella Trail.  It was quite a challenge finding Cinderella trail.  I wouldn’t have been able to do it without my son who went with me on this hike.  There are lots of bikers so don’t bring little kids under the age of 5.  Overall the trail was a workout which I enjoyed.', 'super easy if your just starting out fun path ways you can take all over the park', 'Beautiful scenery with some nice mild inclines to make it decent enough exercise for the day. We went on a Wednesday around 6:30 and there were only a few hikers and a couple of mountain bikers. Great views and easy parking. Highly recommend and would go again.', 'Excellent Trail...Plenty of Shade...Free Parking...Friendly People...would totally go again.', 'sooo dusty but great views of the bay. not really in the redwoods at all lots of sun', 'Came here for a hike, but probably wouldn’t come back for a regular hike. Noticed mountain bikers and trail runners, and it seems like a great trail for that. The hike itself was just so so- not the most scenic or interesting in this area.', 'If you’re a beginner trail runner like me, I’d just do the Sequoia Bayview trail as an out-and-back. Beautiful trees, found it quite tranquil in the morning. Going west on the Cinderella trail is SUPER steep downhill and quite rocky. Fun to hike, but slightly terrifying if you’re a new trail runner.', 'love this trail, just another treasures in the Oakland hill. Great for hiking, jogging, biking. Theres areas available for bbq picnics, and large bbq gatherings. I love the creeks running along the trails and the large redwoods for kids to climb on.', 'Tried it out today (7/6) in the afternoon.  It was okay, don’t think I’d do it again or recommend it, honestly. Pro: there’s a good mix of terrain, from wide flat paths through tall trees to narrow paths through grassy hillside, easy access from main roads in Oakland, mostly shady paths, very few other people hiking it and only a couple of bikers, a good bit of free parking Con: the trails are marked VERY poorly (had I not had this app, I would have been terribly lost), parts of the trail are very narrow which makes getting out of the way for bikers a bit difficult, you can hear planes flying overhead and traffic on the interstate on a good bit of the trail, I spent most of the time looking at the ground making sure I wouldn’t trip over the numerous rocks and wasn’t able to enjoy the actual trail', 'We had a lot of fun on the sunset trail, lots of great views and we didnt run into many people.', ""Mostly shaded trail with nice views and varied vegetation. the trail begins with gentle switchbacks up to Sequoia Bayview trail. From there it is a long flat stretch under the tree line with occasional peeks out towards the bay. The Cinderella Trail narrows quite a bit. (I wouldn't want to meet a bike on that part of the trail as parts of it were rough and the steepest section.) Then you are returned back to the trailhead through a flat fire road. Overall, a nice hike."", 'Parts of the trail are very active with bikers so it can get very dusty. Relatively shady for most of the trail. Pretty easy trail to follow.', 'Nice trail, but you have to watch out for mountain bikes. Alot.', 'Extremely fun and great for all ages.', 'Beautiful!Great hike for you and your dog!', 'I love', 'Nice trails', 'Lovely hike, but the trail is often quite narrow. This would normally be fine, but there are a lot of trail bike riders, and not enough space to accommodate the traffic. It was frustrating for us to constantly move out of their way, and I’m sure it was frustrating for them to constantly be stuck behind hikers.', ""we ended up doing several loops and random trails. it was a bit wet and muddy and still an easy trail. It's amazing to see this kind of beauty is right here in the bay area.  There were many kids out on the trails.  bikers who for the most part were very polite on the trail. and dog owners who also for the most part were polite. Beautiful creeks ,trees and stick forts. there are picnic tables and bathrooms through different spots as well. we will be back."", 'Great hike on a clear day!  Cinderella trail can get crowded with fast downhill bikers. There is also a fork which is not on the map. Keep left for a shortcut to Sinawik or right for some extra eucalyptus trees.', 'Beautiful hike. You do have to watch for bike riders but most I met called out to us hikers. Biggest draw back was running into several dogs off leash. All signs say dogs need to be on leash.', 'I love the views ', 'I enjoyed a 5 mile hike through out these lovely trails.', '', 'Trail had lots of fun shortcuts and you could choose if you wanted to do a long hike or a short hike, lots of options.               Kid friendly and dog friendly, and we were surrounded by trees the whole time', 'Nice morning hike to get the day started :) It can be easy, but there are trails off the sides that will let you challenge yourself.', 'Mountain bikers called Cinderella trail a bike trail and were pretty hazardous to hikers.', 'Beautiful Redwoods here. Lots of history behind the man responsible for this park. Not always about the view. Writer, Poet he was a traveler. This was established around 1870 . Great hiking/biking trails. I was here just this past summer.', 'Nice sunset. Some steep and rocky sections. Watch for mountain bikers', 'Great forest scenes and trails, moderate ups and downs.', 'love it here!! one of my favourite places to come in the bay area. ', 'Great park. Some great views. If you stay on the paved path its a little less then 2miles. However, if you follow some of the other trails, you can get a little more of a workout. Not many hills & they are small. Dogs allowed on trail. Big bonus for me.', 'We hiked the Sunset Trail to the Bayview trail and came back down the mountain via Chaparral trail.  the canopied trails were great coupled with the cool weather and great views.  We will be returning soon!', 'Did the Sanawik Loop Trail and part of the Sunset trail. Sanawik takes you through more forest type nature while the Sunset Trail has some amazing views of Oakland and San Francisco. Highly recommend both trails. Sunset is probably more kid friendly.', ""We went up through the Sunset Trail and at the end of the trail, it recorded 2 miles. We were trying to find the loop back from Sunset Trail but it was a dead end after the goat farm. So we went back down Sunset and took the Sunset Loop Trail which we should have done to begin with. We took the Sequoia Bayview Trail which was supposed to take us to Cinderella Trail and down back to Sunset. But we couldn't find Cinderella Trail so we took the Fern Ravine Trail that connected us back to Sunset. All in all, a total of 5.6mi-- 2 miles up and 3.6 mo looping down with up to about 1200ft elevation. We will do this again and start with the loop and find Cinderella Trail for the complete loop as the map shows."", 'I\'m new to hiking, but I\'ve done three hikes out at this park. To the person who commented there are no views... it\'s a very big park and on my first two hikes I came across beautiful views. If you go down to the meadow (right inside the entrance on Sanborn) and follow the Sunset Trail to the left, you will in fact come upon a view looking over all of Oakland, Alameda, SF - both bridges, etc. There is a little green bench at the top so you can sit down and enjoy the view. If you instead park by the Woodminster Theater and walk down all the steps (where the waterfalls once were - the drought has emptied this park of most of the water sadly) and then follow the fire road, you come to Lookout Point. Also a great view of Oakland. I, sadly, cannot figure out how to do the Sunset Loop, as the only trails I\'ve found are ""Sunset Loop S"" which is not maybe a mile long and you end up back at the meadow. Someday I hope to have it mastered! Lol. Sorry for the novel length review. Oh and yes, watch out for bikers if you\'re just hiking. The trails are narrow almost every time I encounter them. Plenty of nice folks out there. I only have been in the evening, but I highly recommend it. I haven\'t gotten lost yet (which is a miracle!)', 'This place is great! It has two dog park, beautiful nature sceneries, a few little water creeks, and places to BBQ/tables. Definitely more of a family hike instead of true work out, not exactly what I had in mind but truly enjoyed it. Also, my fur child loved running around and got him tired enough to call this hike a success! Hope you enjoy as well.', ""Great hike today! Mild to moderate if you do the loop from sunset to cinderella to sequoia. Trail markers aren't great so it's helpful to have a map."", 'Nice redwood groves and some good views, but this does not compete with other close by trails/parks.', 'Great moderate hike. Should be done counterclockwise as recommended.  Cinderella Trail has loose gravel, some short but narrow claustrophobic portions, steep gradient in a couple of places. Id prefer to come down on it rather than going up, hence counterclockwise.The trails are all very well marked, however, Cinderella trail can be difficult to find. make sure you have GPS phone with a downloaded map.', ""Fantastic park, but it's not Yosemite for sure. Great local preserve."", 'Hidden gem!! Better then Muir Woods!!', 'Busy trail. Bikers running through very narrow paths and almost resulted in accident. Steep crumbly descent in same parts of Cinderella trail. Decent forest views. No scenic lookouts.', 'Nice hiking but lots of mountain bikes so not good for little kids.', 'The trail was flat on some and uphill on others. Sometimes the trail was not easy to follow.', 'I hike this location pretty regularly, its really easy', ""I wish I had read Antoinette S's review as I went for a run and didn't expect the Cinderella trail to be so uphill (and now I see the graphic below the map showing clearly the elevation changes and how I did the trail backwards)...hard for a beginner runner and I did nearly get mowed down by a bicyclist. It's a beautiful trail, but that leg of it I wouldn't call easy."", ""Great trail! The Cinderella trail was more challenging than expected. The trail was very narrow in some parts and you're sharing the road with bikers, so be careful! Overall, it was a great escape from the city."", 'Hiked here with my boyfriend and our dog had an amazing time it was one of my favorite hikes by far', 'This whole area is filled with different hikes and I love it. The majority of the hike is in the woods passing beautiful red wood trees and walking by the creek. Love coming here with my dogs', 'Good hike!', 'One of my favs! Lots of people and dogs off leash though without the owners nearby so beware if your afraid of dogs appearing out of nowhere and smelling you   Two sets of big dogs did this to my little toy poodles with the owners not even within calling distance as I did ask them to come get their animals.  Scary people very trusting of their animals', 'nice trails, great views, close to home!', 'Nice and shady with a good variety of stuff to look at. A little confusing though.', 'Nice trail but almost no views. Cinderella is pretty steep -- our 83 year old grandma struggled up but made it. Also trails are shared with bicyclists.', 'Excellent', 'nice walk fresh air', ""Not too hard, not too easy. Mostly shaded, went during the week and it was pretty empty but I'd expect it to be more traveled during the weekend. It was a little confusing the first time around and I took a couple wrong turns, so bring a map. Great little hike tho"", 'Decent hike with the park and area in disrepair.  It used to be a great hike and park.  Cleared it from my list and did it once.  There are much better hikes close by...', 'Awesome place to hike and Mtb.', '1st time on this loop. besides a few bicycles for excitement, very calm late afternoon trail for the beginning of the Labor Day Weekend.', 'I love this trail. Mostly wooded throughout. Picturesque and lots of forests.', ""We stared at the park and walked the stairs thinking that was the starting point for the trails... It wasn't. We got really frustrated. Also, the park definitely needs a touch up, so much graffiti it's really sad! Wish we weren't in a drought so the fountains could run. Finally found the trails after a short drive down the ranger station. Trails are really nice, which they had printed maps to take along. Views were incredible. Again, wish we weren't in a drought cause I bet with water flowing it's beautiful. Loved seeing all of the Bay Area. I also liked that it wasn't too much incline and was flat for most of the trail we chose (I think sunset trail was the name). Dogs are supposed to be leashed but people don't follow the rules. I kept my dog on a leash and got nervous when dogs came over to her with their owners farther behind. Overall it was great when we finally found the trails and I enjoyed myself."", 'This is my all time East Bay park. There are so many places to go in this park with beautiful new growth redwoods.', 'bring your hiking shoes for the Big Tree Trail.', 'Great for a simple stroll through the woods.', 'Great for riders that are trying out trails that are customised for mountain bikers. Fun to just explore and ride moderately or hard. I recommend both Chapperal and Cinderella trails for downhill riders.

I believe my run was roughly 3.5 miles.', 'Great hike. Trails are mostly in the woods so plenty of shade and feel very comfortable. Popular spot for mountain biking, feel crowded at some stretches of trails  when you have to stay on the side to let the bikers pass. Woodminster theatre worth of a visit by itself.

Lots of bikers though', 'Awesome trail!', ""The hike wasn't extensive and there weren't any breathtaking views, which is what I generally go hiking for. It was refreshing and easy, this was pretty much, a nice walk. Down the hill there was a beautiful fountain and lengthy stairs, we will have to do that workout next time."", 'Great for trail running', ""Gorgeous redwood forest oasis in Oakland. that has tons of trails. There's a lot of areas where the trails aren't clear, but there are so many trains criss-crossing the forest that you soon find one to follow.

Enjoyable experience.', ""I trail run here all the time! One of my favorite spots in the East Bay. The tree canopies provide great shade on hot days. The view of the entire Bay is breath taking at all times of the day- but especially at sunset. This place is filled with hundreds of people hiking, mountain biking, dog walking, trail running--but you can always find a place to be alone if you want solitude.  The Redwoods are gorgeous but sometimes the roots sticking out of the ground and huge embedded rocks can provide for a scary and rigorous bike ride or a gnarly ankle twist if you aren't careful. Regardless, this is a great family place. Everyone is so nice :)"", 'Great trail. I went on an adventure with my trek 3500 and it was super fun. Nice bike trails and beautiful views. You can explore views in different areas but some are a little challenge to get to. Today was my first time on this trail and it rocked.

I’ve been down it several times with a mountain bike and onfoot. Great views, nice distance for a good work out, you could bring a snack or some water in the light as it takes 2.5 hrs at a good clip. The distance on this seem to be off base of my apple series 4 watch with GPS. I will attach a screenshot of my route.', 'Hiked this trail years ago, great experience for a new hiker. It was my first hike. Hiked the shorter trail up to the falls, it was challenging for my first time. Worth it though when we made it to the falls. Took the longer route back, much easier for beginners.', 'Hiked this back in September. Took the lower trail to the falls and the upper trail returning. The lower trail needed some upkeep. There were parts that were washed out and fallen trees that required maneuvering to get around. The insects were constant and my husband and I spent the entire hike out there madly swatting at buzzing creatures. The falls were gorgeous. Hike back was longer but fewer flying friends. About 4 hours total.', 'We hiked this last April and it was gorgeous. At the time lots of poison oak and the trails were washed out on lower section.', 'Like many have said there are trees down on both sides of the loop, not to hard to climb over though. On the lower sections how ever one of the gorges that had a small stream running across that path got blocked debris and diverted the street down along the trail. So roughly 15 yards or so of the trail is washed out. In addition to some other erosion further along at another point that makes the trail very narrow on a pretty steep hill. If you’re thinking of doing the loop it’s advisable that you stay on the upper part. Took about four hours to complete. Beautiful view at the end and along the way.', 'Wonderful trail with a beautiful view. It is long and is strenuous at parts. There are quite a few areas with downed trees. It took 4.5 hours with my 9 year old.', 'Took me 4 hours to complete, counting my little break I took on the lookout by the falls. Overall, the trail loop is very pretty, nicely shaded, and well cut, however, for about half of the west section of the loop it was terribly overgrown and not well marked. The lack of trail at one point and even less markings made me a little disoriented for the last quarter of the west side of the loop. But once I got through that by climbing logs and pushing/cutting a whole bunch of branches, the falls and the eastern part of the loop back made it all worth it:) \nBring bug spray, I was also being followed by a little cloud of gnats for a lot of the time', 'Beautiful hike. I went counter clockwise. Practically all downhill to the falls with a slight grade on the way back. The view of Feather Falls and the ravine is more than worth the hike.', 'In this trail’s defense, I should’ve read the reviews more closely before starting. I’m new to hiking & very much enjoy a well groomed trail, but in good shape, so I enjoy longer, harder trails in terms of elevation. This trail was difficult for me due to the fact that in 3 instances there are downed trees that are hard to get around, especially if you have a 20lb or less pup with you. The overgrowth on this trail was difficult for me as well. Also, when you get to the fork in the trail, if you go to the left, there’s a pretty large portion that’s washed out by a creek that I would imagine would be impassable during the spring months as it would probably be flowing much higher than it was today. My little mini schanuzer Norwich terrier made it, but I did have to carry him the last half mile and strenuous portion to the falls. I wouldn’t take him again. Take lots of water! The waterfall is beautiful but we were told by others on the hike that it’s much prettier in late Oct early Nov!', 'Gorgeous views and great workout!', 'We had a great time. Took fork to right on way in. Beautiful sites on the way. Upper Frey creek falls a pleasant surprise. Last 1/2 mile in to Feather Falls is strenuous but totally worth the reward. The view point lookout is a beautiful spot to soak in magnificent views of the falls and the river valley below. The short jaunt to top of the falls rewards you with a chance to soak the aching feet and knees in crystal clear creek. Great spot for picnic. Returned  by way of the lower or (left fork at start). The trail is in a bit of disrepair and a bit over grown  and the end hike out is a lot of uphill. Reward is given when you recross Frey Creek again.  Make sure to take bug spray the flies and gnats were a bit annoying. Fern fronds make an excellent back up fly swatter. Be on lookout for poison oak, very much in abundance on trail!! Lots of great viewpoints.', 'Don’t make our mistake. At the beginning of the hike we got to the fork in the path where you can go to the left or to the right, we went to the right....wrong choice leaving us with an up hill hike in the heat of the day and little shade. ( we made this decision based on a post in the hiking log that said “Go to the right”) This part of the hike is also not well maintained. If you are going in the summer months start early, use bug spray, take plenty of water and be prepared to climb over some fallen trees. The falls are beautiful!!!.', 'Beautiful falls. There are two trails to choose from. You’ll encounter the split about 1/4 mile after you leave the parking lot.  Going to the right will take you on a 5 mile trail that is reasonably gentle elevation wise.  The hike to the falls is mostly downhill, so the return hike involves more energy. The left (west) trail is only 4 miles long but much greater elevation change. You’ll drop 800’ in about two miles.  Remember that you’ll be facing that as the last part of your return trip. This trail’s low point is about 200’ below the falls. Climbing that in about 1.5 miles will be  your approach to the falls. I wouldn’t recommend this trail in the spring or early summer. The low point is literally in a creek that is probably impassable. On either trail bring plenty of water.  A purifier is handy as there are plenty of streams. Trail maintenance is infrequent.  I encountered a lot of overgrowth and two cases of the trail blocked by fallen trees.  Much of the overgrowth was blackberries:  lots of thorns and a few good berries. All in all a good hike but a but strenuous on the return.', ""There was no sign on the fork & we didn't think of getting a map before we started so we took the trail on the left & apparently it was the more difficult one. About 3.5 miles in we saw a black bear near the trail ahead of us so we ended up having to walk back in fear & in silence without even seeing the waterfall. I've never walked so fast in my life. It was a great workout, but the trail could use some maintance."", ""This trail wasn't worth the effort.  It's long, hot and honestly not that pretty (like some of the women from my past).  The trail is not well maintained, lots of plant life growing into the walking path you can't avoid walking through, a fallen tree you have to climb over.  If you are with a lady in booty shorts, she won’t like it and will keep telling you how much she dislikes it, trust me I know.  There's one good look out point where you can see the waterfall but you're not very close to it.  Other than that spot you can't ever really see it.  When you get to the top of the waterfall the angle is bad and you can't actually see the bottom or the water go off the cliff.  I will say the water at the top is nice, clear and refreshing to get in.  If you like pain with no payoff, this is for you, you masochist."", 'It was such a beautiful hike... perfect weather and beautiful swimming hole at the top of the waterfalls!', 'nice trail with many shaded areas. we take the lower loop in and the upper loop out. platform overlooks the falls. bit of a drive to get there from greater Sacramento area but worth it.', 'Amazing. I was alone all the hike long. It was easy to follow the hike, and it was shady both upper and lower. It is one of the best waterfalls in USA.', ""Hiked the lower trail first which kept us in the shade and in the creek at times. There was one tree on the trail we had to work around. Feather Falls itself was great with a nice, but very sunny platform. The lower trail had lots of benches along the way and there are benches near the viewing platform in the shade. We took the upper trail back, which was a little longer, easier to hike, but had much more sun. Also, there was another tree on the trail we had to work around. There's a second unnamed falls along the upper trail that's also nice. The only complaint was that the poison oak and blackberry bushes are starting to reach a little far into the trail.Overall it was a great hike. Took us 5 hrs with 1 hr spent at the falls (we're also slow hikers)."", 'Great trail! Pay attention to the sigh that says go left/right. Somebody wrote “this sucks” going that direction. Do the sucky side 1st and it’ll be downhill instead of going uphill.', 'A hidden gem. Thankful for previous reviewers and tips. We went yesterday and took our time. We went to the upper, longer or trail to the right then went back down to the 3.5ish mile back. Note that the sign for the fork is gone. The hike going back is full of obstacles like a stream taking over the trail, a tree on the path and some parts overgrown, but it was worth it when we came upon the swim hole near the end and the lady bug colony on the bridge. Be wary of footing as some paths on the edge could give in. Don’t miss the butterfly area on the longer trail by the longer bridge. The loop has so many wonderful benches. Take time to sit and ponder. Also notice the sounds of the streams and how they change in every bend. Do bring lots of water and food so taking time won’t be a problem. We almost had the park to ourselves. If John Muir came, this place would be packed. No fee as well. Enjoy! (Some trash here and there so we picked some reachable ones. Help keep the trash out as it seems hardly maintained.)', 'Love this trail! Overall fairly challenging. You’ll work up a bit of a sweat during the steep parts before making it to the outlook by the gorgeous waterfall. Be prepared for some extra weight if you have children with you. We brought along a 3 yr. old, which made for a long trek up to the waterfall, but she was a trooper and did surprisingly well! The way back down though, she was pretty wiped and we had to take turns carrying her for more than half of the trail. Would definitely do it again.', 'Beautiful trail but make sure you’re prepared!', ""Great hike. Plan well, though. Lots of water or a water filter and snacks. Once you start you'll come to a fork. The lower trail is harder with more changes in elevation and more rocky obstacles where the top trail still has some but not as much. About 3 miles in (we started on the lower trail) you come to a wooden sign that says falls. Follow it, obviously...lol you're about 0.5miles to your destination. At that sign the other trail is the other way out. Towards the end there's a railing. If you look to the right just as the railing turns and takes you to the left there's an unmarked but obvious trail up to the top of the water falls. It's about .25 mile but so worth it!"", ""A Jere's Jaunts hike. My brother and I set a good pace but Marty blew our doors off. I think he believes all hikes are a workout/competition.  Lots of switchbacks on this trail but a good mix of scenery and the falls itself is really nice, one of the larger in our area."", 'Excellent hike!  Fairly level with some up-and downs on the upper trail, more significant elevation changes on the lower. Lots of mosquitoes, so bring bug spray!  Outlook point at the end is 100% worth it, bring a lunch and enjoy it at the end with a great view.', 'Feather Falls is beautiful, sacred and majestic. The trail has spectacular views. Truly a spiritual journey.', 'Beautiful trail.', ""Beautiful hike. Would recommend taking the left fork going in and the opposite side of the loop out for an easier route. Bring lots of bug spray for yourself and your dogs. There's a good amount of shade throughout the hike."", 'Right on! This is my favorite so far.', 'Love this hike gorgeous gorgeous waterfall worth the hike in.  Lots of mosquitos today glad we took repellant.  Always lots of friendly families with kids and dogs.  This is a great family hike.', 'Love this hike. The view is great, we went in January. I recommend the extended hike pass the overlook to get to the top of the waterfall. There were a few downed trees that we had to go over or under, along the path. I’ve done the lower trail back and forth as well as the upper trail back and forth. Lower has more streams and shade. Upper has a nice small waterfall.. we did not run into any bugs during January but I have heard that gnats can be a issue during later months as well as mosquitoes.', 'great hike, awesome waterfall.', 'Great trail hike the views are worth the hike. start to the trail on the left all down hill great photo ops, and on the way out go left nice easy gradual hike back out.', 'Solid.  You can make it tomorrow steep or easy and either way you see the falls and the top of the river.', 'Beautiful place to hike and see Gods creation. about 8 miles  of trail. easier and longer by 1/2 mile way to go on the right  but shorter and steeper  on the way is on the left.  recomend this hike if you will be in that area of Oroville.', 'Wicked Kool', 'This hike is absolutely amazing. It is pretty difficult though. I’m 20 and I’m pretty good shape and it had me and both my friends sweating. The whole loop is gorgeous. Tons of wildlife like the California newt, banana slugs, and all the lizards you could want to see. On my second visit did run into a couple tiny Alameda striped Racer snakes. It’s an amazing hike for all ages but it is definitely a workout. 100% is a must do while you are in the area. I try and go at least once a week because it is just so beautiful.', 'Be careful! Poison Oak on this trail!', 'Great hike with amazing scenery. The waterfall is worth the distance. It was pretty tough taking the lower trail to get back as it is mostly uphill.', 'it was a long hike but worth it at the end', ""Amazing waterfall. Easy to navigate.   Takes a long time to achieve the waterfall, but it's worth it!"", 'Great place to hike !! Trail was very well maintained and easy to navigate. And the views were worth every bit of aching feet and back. Met lots of friendly hikers and dogs. Only disappointment was the graffiti and the trash and empty water bottles people left behind.', 'One of my all time favorites! Stunning scenery! Upper trail is easy, if you want a  difficult loop, hike the upper trail in & lower trail out (almost entirely up hill). Amazing beauty the entire trail any time of year! Not easy for young kids.', 'Very Nice', 'I really like this trail. I have done the full loop once in the summer and the last time we hiked the eastern 4.5 mile both ways to add some extra mileage. The waterfall is beautiful albeit a little touristy for my taste. A mostly shaded hike with some great views and wildlife. We have seen orange salamanders both times on the trail summer and winter. Dog friendly!', 'Nice hike. Several ticks were trying to attach to do and and one attached to my leg. Be prepared and check yourself and animals well.', 'one of my all time favorite hikes. easy terrain, no steep grades, but still an engaging hike to a gorgeous view. we often camp 1 or 2 nights at the trail head.', 'Such an amazing and beautiful hike.', 'Hiked here 2 weekends ago with the pup and it was great! Picked up 2 ticks early on but didn’t see anymore for the rest of the trail. Great views, peaceful walk. Only busy part was the overlook to the waterfall other than that we barely saw anyone else. Parking is easy at the trailhead but the bathrooms are GROSS.', 'I didn’t complain at all after I got to the end', 'Awesome trail! Sun was out with blue sky and temps in the upper 50’s. Started out a little chill but soon the jacket was off and sweating. Took the upper trail to the falls and returned on the lower. I would probably do the opposite next time because you’re going uphill the whole way back when returning on the lower trail. Stay to the left when the trail forks near the beginning & then follow the loop trail GPS. Ended up being 8 miles. Went during the week and it was so peaceful and tranquil.', 'Nice scenic trail. Forks off in the beggining and I chose the high road. On the trail by 7am had it all to myself! So peaceful', 'Did not take the loop everyone talked about went out to the outlook and back. Started from the main parking area. The directions link on all trails will take you right into the parking area. (Sometimes I find the not all the direct links are good but this one was spot on) I’m in good shape and it took me 80 minutes each way. Really pretty views. A decent moderate as others said. On a scale of 1-10 in difficultly I️ would give it a 4. Saw individuals of all ages and abilities. Trail is dog friendly:) enough traffic that I️ wasn’t isolated but also isolated enough to be with nature I️ solitude.', ""Great hike, my wife's first over nighter. We loved it. Not quite a day hike for us but we jade a great time."", 'Erosion has plagued most of the trail as there are deep cuts and downed trees. Some of the sections can get pretty narrow. There are multiple water crossings (3 bridges/4 small streams) and plenty of sights. Look for Bald Cap Dome (similar to Half Dome in Yosemite) on the upper trail and watch out for ticks in the lower loop’s vegetation. There is also an optional route to the actual top off the falls instead of the viewing platform. You can eat lunch in the shade next to the river for a great afternoon of adventure.', 'This is one of a amazing hike, I have enjoyed thoroughly as it is in the Riparian Habitat. After nearly 0.5 mile the trail bifurcates into 2 trails, the lower and the upper trail. There are no trail markings there though. The lower trail is close to 3.8 mile and the upper trail is 4 to 5 miles. The lower trail is steep and the upper trail is gradual. I took the lower trail to reach the falls and took the upper trail for the return. This way the hike is lot more easier. Spring and Fall would be the ideal time for the hike. On the path of upper trail  you will get to see a Half dome formation similar to Yosemite and pass through another small falls. there is water around the year in these falls.', ""it's open , the fires didn't reach the campsites or trails, but alot of people lost their home on the road that leads up their . besides all the natural disasters it's one of the best dog friendly trails in the area."", 'Great trail! Definitely worth it, the falls are gorgeous. The trail is very well maintained, the grade is steep and long, but worth every step!', 'Currently closed due to fire', 'Awesome loop had a blast and view is great', '', 'Absolutely breath taking! Most of the trail is shaded by trees and pass through few creeks to cool down', ""I was maybe a little unprepared for this hike. We had seen a couple and asked asked whether to take the 3.3 or the 4.5 trail to get to the falls they suggested the 4.5. This led us to 11 miles once we were done. Also didn't help we went on such a hot day it was over 100. Only because we weren't rewarded with a swimming hole that we could take a dip in. We did however stop at the first falls which was about 2 miles in. The actual Feather falls Waterfall was thriving and beautiful but there is lack of shade once you get to the look out point. Be very prepared with lots of water and aware of the no swimming holes to cool down in. Also that its a tad longer than what the site says depending on if you take the lower trails."", 'lots of water and make sure you start early', 'If you are going to go behind the falls, please be aware to not get in the water, and use your common senses. The lower trail is still in disrepair after this winter.', 'Very nice hike. We took the upper trail to the Falls and came back the same way. It is a little longer than the loop. Other reviewers mentioned the lower trail was in disrepair so we skipped it. Ended up being more like an 11 mile hike round trip. Not strenuous but a satisfying, lengthy hike with a beautiful view of Feather Falls.', 'I would suggest taking the 3.3 in and the 4.5 out.', ""This is a nice moderate trail. If you want to complete the loop, I'd recommend going down on the Lower Trail and back up on the Upper Trail.  As others have pointed out, the Lower Trail is not only steeper (and shorter), but it is in disrepair. This means some scrambling is needed to navigate it. If you have little ones, you might want to stick to the Upper Trail. We went down on the Lower Trail and back out on the Upper Trail.  My three-star rating reflects the heavy erosion on the Lower Trail. If it were in better condition, I'd give this trail four stars.\n\nThe trail is mostly shaded, although the Upper Trail does have some spots with direct sun exposure. We were there in late May and it was pretty hot and humid, We also got a late start driving to the area from Sacramento.  I think the trail is probably best completed in late April/early May when the wildflowers are out and it's not too hot.  \n\nYou are rewarded with fabulous views of Feather Falls. The falls are exceptionally powerful this year (2017) after a much-needed long and wet winter.  The Lower and Upper Trails meet near the falls.  Once you get to the falls, you can hike down into the canyon for unobstructed views of the falls (the Overlook). This trail is pretty eroded right now, but it's worth getting a nice view (I posted the requisite picture with a rainbow).  You can also hike up and around the canyon to get to the top of the falls.  We did this after the Overlook and ate lunch at the top of the falls. It can get a little crowded with families, but it is a nice shady spot to take a break before hiking up and out of the canyon. \n\nI'd recommend bringing bug spray. I seemed to attract them the second I stop to take in the views and a drink of water.  Getting an early morning start would have alleviated having to deal with bugs.  Also, I recommend bringing sunblock. Even though the trail is pretty shaded, there are sections with sun exposure and you will likely need to reapply given the length of the hike.\n\nOverall, an excellent day hike for those living in the Sacramento area.  Get an early start and try this trail before the summer heat sets in."", 'This is a lovely, mostly shady and relatively flat hike if you take the ""upper loop"". The old oak and madrone trees are spectacular! I do not recommend the lower trail as it is deeply rutted and hikers are just making the erosion and damage worse. Hopefully the Forest Service will close it and make some much needed repairs.', 'The brush is growing into the trail and there are a few logs crossing the trail. It would be helpful to bring some clippers.', ""Maybe my favorite hike ever! We went on a misty morning in April. Dogwoods in bloom. Moss everywhere. Newts crossing the path so frequently that you really need to watch out not to step on one. Absolutely gorgeous canopy and trail. A great shady hike into a magical forest. We went lower trail in, hooked left up to feather falls and then upper trail out. Pretty steep climb coming out, Make sure to bring enough water. We'll be going again in the fall and likely once every spring at least. Can't recommend this trail enough!"", ""Mother's Day hike yesterday, weather was perfect, not hot, still green with flowers and lots of water.  Went short in and long out, it was not easy but worth it"", 'Enjoyed the hike with my family  & our dog! The lower trail does have a few washed out spots so be careful in those areas.', ""WOW JUST WOW! First off I want to thank Steve and Chris for hiking and recording our event this morning. We started at 7:30AM and we were done by 11:00AM for a total of 9 miles. The main waterfall was a very beautiful site to see. We took the 4 1/2 mile route and it was very challenging coming back the other way. After the fall it was pretty much an up hill hike, so be prepare for a nice 2 1/2 up climb going back the parking area. There are about four awesome water area and you can even camp out there. Be aware of all the poison oak, it's everywhere. Overall this was one of my top 3 hikes. Do enjoy and be safe. God bless!"", 'Love this hike! Beautiful scenery and being a loop hike makes it that much more enjoyable.', 'Moderate to hard hike with lots of hills. Bring lots of mosquito repellant!

Save your energy if you do the whole loop.', '♥️beauty all around', 'Beautiful hike, I had the trail and the waterfalls for myself in the morning, since I started early. I camped at the trail head: nice basic campground. The return hike around noon was much more crowded. With the exceptional rainfalls we had this year, every creek and fall was ""at full capacity"", and the nature was in full bloom. Beware of the newts that cross the trail: there was so many of them that you had to be careful not to step on them, especially in the cool, humid morning...', 'Have done this a couple times, most recent 2 weeks ago, lower trail eroded badly in spots, waterfall is gushing, beautiful.', 'Great hike!  We took the 3.3 mile section to the Falls and can back the 4.5 mile side.', 'Amazing    Took the left side (steep) in and other way out.  Extra mile to go to the top of the falls and back. Well worth it!', 'It was a great day lots and lots of hikers of all ages on the trail', ""Just did this hike on Sunday, 4/23. It was beautiful and definitely worth the two hour drive from Sacramento. There was A LOT of poison oak. The trail is pretty well shaded. There's a fork in the trail right before you get to the falls overlook. There's a sign that says overlook left, but doesn't say what the right part leads to. We went that way and it takes you to the river right before the falls and a small group camping site for backpackers. We ended up setting up my hammock and taking a nap by the river for a couple hours. Even though the trail was pretty crowded on Sunday, we were the only ones in that area."", 'Beautiful trail, but arrive early (7-9 am) and spend the entire day here. I came with my family and everyone was able to finish the 8 mile loop trail and witness the beauty of the 410 ft Feather Falls.

Trails are in pretty good condition considering all the rain we got. Only issue is lots of trash along the trail and took away from the beauty, we packed out twice more then what we hiked in with. PEOPLE PLS PACK OUT YOUR TRASH!! and even a little more it never hurts.', 'I definitely enjoyed this hike', 'beautiful wet easter hike.. plan for a full day. this is not an easy hike by any means. my wife and i spent almost 3 hours hiking in close to 4 miles and still never reached the falls. if we would have kept going and didnt turn back whg en we did we would have been stuck at the top of the mountain in the dark. we barely made it out before dark. alot of the trails were missing washed away from the rains so we had to improvise but over all it was nice. its not an easy ', 'Went backpacking with the family.  Camped about 1/2 mile past the falls.  Saw very little wildlife,  Trail was quite on Friday and fairly busy on Saturday.  Lots of water, several times we had to cross or walk along water flowing on the trails.  Beautiful hike.', 'Fantastic falls!  Been wanting to see these 7th highest falls in US for a long while and we finally got to!  IMPORTANT NOTE:  if you are set on doing the loop, our family highly recommends you take the shorter 3.3 mile trek (to the left at fork) FIRST/down the canyon and return after you see the falls on the longer 4.5 mile trek.  While 4.5 miles is longer, it is very flat (see topo maps here) while the 3.3 leg is steep down, it is so super difficult coming back up on the return, especially with kids and slightly out-of-shape adults.   Have fun!!!!  And oh yeah, if you take dogs, watch for:1. Low poison oak along trail in Spring, and 2.  Ticks.   Our daughter found 3 during, and 4 after the hike.', 'Best season to hike.  Few people for a popular trail.  Fall are running at full force.  Weather mild.  BEWARE trails have been damaged from spring run off, recommend water resistant shoes/boots and bring a hiking pole.  It is beautiful.', ""Beautiful but in all we walked about 11.5 miles. We stayed to the left and that definitely seemed to be the best route. The water all around was amazing and the trails were well maintained if not washed out from the rains. There are ways around though, or even through.

When you reach the fork on the trial, take your pick;The right turn has a light descent with a nice smaller waterfall and swimming hole on the way. The left turn is a shorter trail but... much steeper descending and ascending hills. There are a couple good swimming spots this way also. Take caution, there are a few large size wash-outs along the way. Great views on this route as well.  Either way, you will end up at the falls and you won't be disappointed!Personally, I like the up better than down so I prefer to take the right trail in and do the other trail out.

Since we started late (11:30 am), we decided to start the loop by going right, because we didn't want to run into a lot of people. This was a good decision that worked for us. We only ran into a few groups on this side of the trail. The views were amazing and hanging out by the waterfall to cool off  was worth the hike! We rested for about 30 mins at the waterfall before deciding to head back out on the other trail, to complete the loop. We ran into fewer people on our way out and saw millions of ladybugs!

Other that the trash you can almost compare it to a more forest version of Yosemite"", ""I was racing sunlight so I couldn't make it up the falls trail, however I did do the loop in a little over 2 hours. I took the longer trail down, and came up the shorter- yet steeper- side. I consider myself to be an average hiker, and this climb gets you sweating... I wouldn't rate it as easy. Beautiful hike, but give yourself plenty of time to do it. I ended up running the first half of it just to make sure I made it back by sun down. My device tracked a little over 9 miles. Cheers!"", 'I always love doing this hike! I would recommend doing the 3.3 miles in and the 4.5 miles out. The shorter trail is pretty much downhill the first couple of miles, so going back up that way would be exhausting. The perfect time to go is spring and fall. Summer is just excruciating and not as enjoyable. There are different scenic points where you get some amazing views. You can also go down to the deck or hike another half a mile up and go to the top of the waterfall. Bring a ton of water and snacks to enjoy a picnic when you get to the waterfall.', 'Did not like this hike.  It was long, waaay to hot and very little payoff at the end.  The falls were a trickle, there were hornets and yellowjackets everywhere.  Not worth it.  Maybe a better hike in very early summer or late spring.', ""1. It's not 8 miles of you want to see the waterfall. (And who doesn't?) My phone logged 10+miles. With a quick lunch & a couple rests, it took us almost 4 hours. (And we ran part of the trail & were passing people.)\n2. DO NOT TAKE THE LONG TRAIL FIRST thinking you'll have it easier on the way back!!! We made that mistake. Taking the short trail back means you have a HUGE climb up for the last 2 miles. It sucked.\n3. The trail is clearly marked the whole way, but it's not always a cleared pathway. There are some challenges. We climbed over a couple downed tress & hopped a few streams. It's not a nature walk. It's a hike, for sure. \n4. There's seriously bears. Know what to do. Have something to defend yourself. Be alert. \n\nI don't know if I'd do this one again, but it's a pretty cool hike."", 'Good hike.  My 11yr old went with me and had no problem.  Beautiful single track that opens up to see the falls.  We missed seeing the ladybug hibernation but suspect that would make the trip a 5 star event.\n\nThe parking lot felt a little sketchy so we hid everything really well.  Another hiker saw a bear we did not.  However, encountered an unwelcoming group of hikers with mean dogs off leash, was pretty intense.  I would not hike this trail alone.', 'Long hike. One of my favorite falls! Can hike to the top and look down. Awesome view! And scary!', 'Really nice hike. Our favorite time to go is March. It is not too hot and the falls have more water. Be careful about bears. There are a lot up there and we have seen a couple when we have gone up really early (just after sunrise). This one is good for dogs too, not to hard and a lot of shady areas.', ""Fun hike to get the heart beating and the sweat dripping! We took the short trail in and the longer trail back out. The extra little part up above the falls is definitely worth it. On a hot day, I bet the water would feel great. On a hot day, you'll definitely want lots of water. Can see a lot of wildlife (ladybugs, lizards, birds, snakes, slugs...) and very pretty wildflowers."", 'two trails to the falls. the hike winds you through the pines and wild flowers. one trail takes you past a small water fall; perfect for your best for legged friend to take a dip in. the hike gets slightly steep towards the last stretch. when you catch the view of the sixth tallest waterfall in the u.s. it makes it worth it. hike the shorter trail on your way out to get a glimpse of some old native grind stones', ""Easy trail. Did the loop.  (about 9miles) Took a star off because of the mosquitoes. Can't catch a break longer then 2 minutes without getting attacked. The fall is amazing. They have a look out patio with a great view of the fall and canyons. You can also hike to the top of the fall itself. They have a fence because someone fell from the top of the Water fall and died."", 'Took the upper loop to falls and lower loop back to trailhead. most people were doing it the other way saying it was easier..\n\nThe trail scenery was meh..the reward for a semi-monotonous hike is really the falls. Definitely worth it.  The wildflowers blooming this time of year also added enjoyment to the trail. Bald rock dome was also an interesting feature. Some tagging/vandalism noted...what a shame.', ""I loved this hike. pack plenty of water. had a snack at the overlook, and added the extra mile to go to the top of the falls, well worth it! beautiful up there! Hike the short one in, it's tough but the long way out is nice when your tired. or if you don't want to do the loop long both ways. I've always been an active person and am out of shape and over weight at the moment, but found the hike, moderate with a few easy places."", ""worth doing! best time is winter for temperature. waterfall incredible especially in spring. have done it about 3 times, bit of a drive. fun with a group, picnic lunch to enjoy out on platform overlook. hike itself isn't anything to write home about with all our varieties in Sierra but destination is fabulous! prefer walking clockwise at the loop due to hills, if you need it easy, go in and out in same direction as opposed to making loop, fork to right whichi is gradual whole distance. fork at left is up and down with few steep sections"", ""Awesome hike, my husband and I will be sore tomorrow, but worth the hike. Bring plenty of water, maybe a couple ibuprofen if you're doing the whole loop, your muscles will thank you."", ""I have been on this hike twice now and it is a good hike and even better workout.  The waterfall is awesome and the platform is perfect for viewing.  I even got top gunned by someone in an air force jet.  You know the scene where Maverick dose the fly by and the General spills his coffee.  I didn't spill my coffee, but that jerk had to be messing with me, he couldn't of been more than 100 feet overhead."", ""I went on this hike with my best friend Getlin. We decided to take the easier path to make the hike last a little longer however nothing went as planned. To start, the trail is great but horribly marked! We found plenty of plaques and signs about the wild life and about the area however vary few to none about the falls look out spot. If only someone had told us the trail was behind an unmarked bench then we would have explored those little trails but once again there is no sign or anything to imply that there was a look out! We ended up walking the easy trail down at 4.3 miles long and the harder trail back which was 3.3 miles up hill lol. In the end we where exhausted however we felt like we achieved something so we will be doing this trail again and I'm bringing some bright ribbon to at least mark the trail a little. We completed the trail in 3 hours with three 5 minute breaks!"", ""Overall, this is a great hike.  You can either do the loop or just do a simple out and back on one leg.  Getting there around 9am was awesome.  There was no one around till much later (11am-1pm)  The hiking is from easy to moderate.  Currently the falls are awesome!  I highly recommend spending the time to drive out there and do the hike.  Based on a review I expected to see a bunch of trash but didn't see any.  Also as of 24 Jan 15, the lower loop bridge is open.  Have fun!  \n\np.s. Stopping for lunch for about 30 minutes at the falls and moving at a moderate speed with little breaks, my wife and I completed this in 4:15 hours total."", 'I went in the Winter after a decent rain. The falls were magnificent. Well worth the effort.', ""This get three stars because it is a cool area and the falls are great and the deck by the falls is a nice mid-hike break. BUT, I was reluctant to give it that many stars because this was literally the most trashed trail I've ever seen in California. It was so bad I suspect it might be deliberate. Dog crap on the trails. Water bottles all over the place. Cans crunched and thrown into weeds. Switchbacks all scraped off from cutting corners, one of which I actually saw a hillbilly-as-style-choice in motorcycle boots ski down, soil spilling everywhere. The bridges are busted and spray tagged. Cigarette butts EVERYWHERE. There were wrappers and tissues scattered about. The signs were tagged with markers. The bathrooms looked like crime scenes. It's a dirty shame that a trail with this much potential has to be ruined by trashy people."", 'on august 30 2014 myself my dog and my friends family of 4 a 4 year old girl and a 10 year old boy and his wife we hiked the trail in 6 hours round trip long way in and out due to the mistaken belief that the bridge was out on the shorter route with 30 min for lunch at the overlook . was a beautiful hike started at 8:15 am the gnats were terrible on the way in but gone on the way out (thank the lord) took 2 24 ounce bottles of water for myself and 3 small bottles of water for my dog ran outta water 5 minutes from parking lot so a little more water would have been nice but overall the hike was completely awsome the falls were low but still beautiful the only problems were poison oak (everywhere) the prolific swarms of gnats in the morning and the turnoff to the overlook was not indicated on a sign so we got about .5 extra miles b4 another hiker straightend us out but awsome and I will be doing it again enjoy!!', ""3 Hours?roundtrip I don't know how that is possible, well maybe for trail running.\nStarted at 1:30pm,....got to the fall at 3pm..took a hour break at the overlook & Waterfall spot.\nstarted walking around 4pm at 4 mile left water running empty less than 10oz of water.\nmade it back by 6pm 92degree 68% humidity. becareful, bring water in summer time.\n\nThe Waterfall itself is a bit low...not as amazing.\n4th time on this trail. summer time is alot harder when its hot."", 'We did this hike with a 13 year old and a 7 year old.  It was a beautiful and fun hike.  We hiked the 4.5 mile rout both to and from.  It was a bit long for the kids, but fun all the same.  The falls are breathtaking- especially if you hike over to the top.  A highly recommended hike- take plenty of water...', 'I hiked this trail twice. Both short and long routes & went up to the top of the falls. A good part of the trail is shady, but lots of mosquitoes. My friends and I were covered in mosquito bites. Bug spray the second time kept the bug bites to a minimum.', ""I think the people commenting on here are superhuman.  We took the shorter route to the falls and the longer route back out.  I think the signs say  3.5 in on the short route and 4.5 miles out on the long route.   On the way in we stopped at the bridge and splashed some water on ourselves.  At the falls we spent maybe 20-30 minutes.  On the way out we stopped and splashed more water on ourselves.  Parked at 1200 and returned to the parking lot at 1900.  Without taking breaks I would guess over 5 and a half hours.   The mosquito's are horrible and the poison oak is everywhere.  TAKE PLENTY OF WATER!!! We ran out of water with 3 miles left."", ""Nice hike, but long be prepared. I took my dog so I had him carry all the stuff I brought. Beware of ticks! My dog never got any due to the Frontline but guess who did? Yep me! Waterfall isn't as spectacular as I would have liked but if you want to be in nature its a nice hike. Went in the spring and there were too many bugs for my liking but could have just been a bad day."", 'Very nice hike. We took the lower loop trail into the falls and the upper loop back to the parking area. The lower loop is mostly downhill for the first 2+ miles, and the last 1+ mile is uphill. The upper loop on the way out was fairly flat for the first 1 1/2 mi. Then mostly uphill for the next 3 mi. The falls and scenery were very nice. Start early and pack a lot of water and snacks. With breaks and time at the falls plan on 4 to 4 1/2 hrs.', ""St. Patty's day walk was fun. 8.4 miles total round trip. 3.3 miles on the lower loop to the head of the falls trail, then 4.5 back on the upper loop returning to the parking area. The shorter loop descends for approximately 2.2 miles and then ascends the last 1.1 mile. The upper and lower loops come together where the trail to the falls is located which is about 0.6 miles round trip. The upper loop is longer but the altitude change is not as dramatic as the lower loop and in turn is a much easier hike. I recommend hiking the lower loop to the falls and the upper loop back to the parking area to avoid the 2 mile ascent of the lower loop. Though the overall hike would be quicker it would also be significantly harder. Also, the lower loop is not very difficult but the trail itself is not as wide or as easy to hike as the upper loop is. There is an old broken bridge on the lower loop which may be hard for small kids but average adults should be able to cross it easily. The upper loop is overall a safer route for kids or those concerned with ability. Total time with 10 min at the falls and 15 minute break at the scenic bridge on the upper trail on the way back was 3 hours 15 min for 8.4 miles. Good hike to inspire more adventures and build confidence."", 'Ive hiked this twice now and each time notice more and more details. Today, it was the millions of ladybugs migrating that I was able to capture. They are found @ Frey Creek along the shorter trail. What a sight they were to see! I have uploaded a few photos from the hike today. Took the long path out and the shorter one back...came out to 9.4 miles (verified via Jawbone Up). The weather was an amazing 72 deg. I recommend this to anyone before it gets any colder. 4.5hrs with a 4 year old and a pair of teenagers! Pack a lunch and some H2O!', ""This was a great hike.Take the upper trail (longer) to the Falls and then the lower (shorter) trail home. They say the lower trail is closed but it really isn't. The path is in great condition with the only problem being a bridge that is broken but it is easy to navigate and most people take that trail. There is a upper/lower trail split about a half mile into the hike. There is a lot of poison oak so wear long pants. The paths are in excellent condition. We were surprised at how much water was still flowing over the falls this late in the season. Heat was definitely a factor so start early. Although the trail is 80% deeply shaded, it still gets hot as the day progresses. When we arrived back at the car at 1pm it was 95° and the last mile (+) is all switchbacks up hill."", ""One of my favorite hikes. Go up the longer but easier route and come back the shorter but a lot more taxing route. It's beautiful, it's a workout. The viewing deck is nice to see the falls straight on but gets crowded and hot. Hike a further 0.5miles or so to get to area before the falls.........it's beautiful and quiet. You can get into the river and cool down (don't do this in the moving part or close to the falls, people have died here), have snacks, nap etc.\nRattlers come out in the warm months so be careful. \nDefinitely not to be missed.\n\nDid it for 3rd time, still strenuous but wonderful. No rattlers in early March"", ""The hike was beautiful this past weekend. The lower trail (3.3 mile) was closed and the upper trail (4.5 miles) is in great shape. Trail was lined with wild flowers and A LOT of poison oak right now so be aware. The falls were spectacular and the viewing deck was quite busy by noon. It was about 90 degrees on Saturday and while the viewing deck doesn't have any shade there are benches in the shade just before the deck.  Used more water than anticipated, recommend two bottle for each hiker minimum. Sunscreen as well. Enjoy the falls and prepare for the moderate grind back to the parking lot. You'll know you've done something by the time you're done."", ""I have been waiting to go check out the falls for the last couple years but I wasn't in as good of shape as I am now; my husband and I finally made it! The first 4 miles are generally easy/moderate; generally smooth and wide with some minor rocky spots. Lots of ups and downs. The last mile is where the strenuous comes in.  Steeper inclines and lots of rocks and to get to the final falls viewing platform. Lots of people eat lunch in that final platform but there is no shade so keep that in mind. Overall a great hike; took us about five hours and we went the longer way  both directions so we traveled about 9 1/2 miles. Make sure you wear cool clothing, bring sunscreen, and plenty of water. "", 'Great hike, but I hate the down and in/up and out hikes :-)  The falls are spectacular, however we went last year right after a student from CSU Chico went over the falls making the mood somber.', ""The hike itself is just beautiful but the reward at the end is breathtaking!  I hiked this on a beautiful spring day and the flow of the falls is quite voluminous!  I took the upper trail to the falls and the lower trail back.  The lower trail had a few spots that were a bit tricky.  If you hike in on the lower trail, watch out for the first bridge.  There's a gap between the beginning of the bridge and the trail that would be easy to get your foot caught in.  The hike to the falls on the upper trail was a breeze.  The hike back on the lower trail really kicked my behind.  We got started at 8:30 am and there was hardly a soul.  When we finished at 12pm, the parking lot was packed.  Get an early start!  Great hike!  \n\nOh and one more thing - be super vigilant for poison oak!  That stuff was EVERYWHERE.  As long as you keep your arms and legs either covered or well away from the edges of the trail, you will be ok."", 'Excellent trail!  You wont be disappointed!! Everyone says take the lower trail first then loop back from the upper but found it much easier the opposite direction.  There are signs posted that the lower fall bridge is out, while the bridge is damaged its very easily passable and worth the hike!', ""There is a large free parking lot at the trail head that also features some campgrounds and a toilet that doesn't seem to be cleaned or stocked much.   Dogs are permitted.   Mountain bikes are permitted. \n\nThe shorter, lower trail is closed as a bridge is out.  \nThe longer upper trail is in good condition with some trees across the trail in places, all easily passable.  There is no rock climbing or such on this trail, it is well groomed.  It is a lovely hike with nice views of the forest, the canyon and a nice creek crossing.  At the Feather Falls overlook, there is a nice platform were one can sit and enjoy the view of the waterfall and down the canyon.  One can go a little bit further and be at the top of the falls themselves!  \n\nAt the place where the upper and lower trails come together near the falls, the sign post says it is 4.5 miles back to the parking area.  I think this hike is actually close to 10 miles round trip.  \n\n\n"", 'A well worth hike to go on. The trail was well maintained & the scenery was beautiful to look at. We hiked up and down the 4.5 trail to the falls because the bridge is down for the 3.5 trail. 10 miles was def a long stretch but seeing the sights was amazing.', 'Beautiful trail, strenuous in parts, buts its the sheer length 9miles round trip that is the challenge.  Amazing views, well kept trail, not busy at all.  Bring water as there is no potable source.  ', 'Loved it! Beautiful. The falls were cool we ate lunch next to the cascading water.  Will do it again for sure. ', 'This trail is rated moderate??  Well for this 64 year old grandmother it was definitely strenuous.  A beautiful hike though.  Our GPS said total mileage was 9.6 all the way to the Falls overlook and back.  This was for the upper trail as the lower trail was closed.  The last half mile to the falls and the last 2 miles back to the parking lot were pretty strenuous.  Even in mid-autumn the Falls were spectacular.  \n\nBe sure to take water and use the restroom in the parking lot as there are no other bathroom facilities.', 'What a great little hike.  4 miles one way. The upper-longer trail is easier than the lower-shorter trail. Pretty moderate hike, a few challenging hills but the falls is well worth the trip. There is a really nice viewing platform for great pictures. If you wish to swim in the falls river, you must go past the  platform and past the fenced cliff overhang. Once up river there are a few nice campsites for small groups.', 'This is a wonderful trail to hike, just be sure you give yourself enough time to make it to the falls and back before sundown. My mistake for hiking this trail later in the day. I took the long route up and the short route back. Short route was a little more strenuous than the the long meandering route. But both were equally pretty. At the falls there is a nice observation deck to enjoy the view and maybe have a light lunch before heading back down. I hope to do this hike again soon.', 'One of my favorite hikes. A bit of a long hike, but not too challenging at all. I took my mini Dachshund and she had no trouble keeping up on hike. The waterfall is very beautiful! ', 'A peaceful trip. Great for dogs. My dog enjoyed tromping around the countryside.', 'Did this hike twice, the last time about a year ago when the lower part of the loop was closed for repair. Great hike. ', 'Great hike! Took long route in and out. The Falls are so worth the hike. ', 'This was my real first Mountain Bike run.  I took the longer trail in and the shorter trail back.  I had to carry the bike for a lot of the way back up.  There are some serious drop offs and gaps on the short trail.  It is around 1200 ft elevation change each way.  I had a blast and would love too ride it again.

Steep and exhausting, but the views at the top was amazing! I went in mid November and there was no snow yet.', 'The ideal introduction to hiking trails in Tahoe.  Spectacular views begin almost immediately.  Granite Lake, about half way up, is charmingly picturesque, and there are more stunning views nearing the saddle.  You can stop and go back at any point and have a pleasant hike. You can do it in 3 hours but why not take longer and enjoy it.', 'Great hike, lots of elevation gain. It took us and a dog about 3 hours there and back. Be aware that out and back is almost 6 miles to top of the peak. The view was incredible and worth it!', 'Hard at times due to continued climbing up, but it’s worth every step because of the amazing views at the very top.', 'This hike is amazing! Highly recommend! Dog friendly. Lake along the way for pups to swim and cool off.', 'Beautiful hike and views. Did an amazing sunrise hike and the whole way up to the peak we got beautiful views of the sun coming over the mountains with the lake in front. Little steep at times but definitely a consistent incline. Top has a well worth it view.', 'It’s a very beautiful hike with lots of lake views. We stopped by at Granite Lake for lunch and since it was end of fall, it wasn’t very crowded. The trail is well maintained. The views at various vistas are spectacular. I’d rate it between moderate and difficult.', 'Not too difficult. Took 2 hours even though we stopped for some photos. The toilets in the parking area are extremely dodgy... Bring your own toilet paper!', '10-15-18 Parking lot is closed, but it is only 1/4 mile to the trailhead.  Cascade Falls is to the left and this trail (to the right) appeared to be labeled Desolation Wilderness.  The notice posted at the trailhead stated that from 8-29-18 until 12-31-20 the Desolation Wilderness is closed unless you have a permit (see photo).  THERE ARE NO PERMITS IN THE BOX.  Cascade Falls was awesome!', 'I have mixed feelings about this hike.The trailhead is somewhat easy to access (located at the very back of bay view campground). Limited parking especially on busy weekends.You get incredible views of Emerald Bay from several view points on your way up.There are lots of switchbacks on your way up. LOTS of elevation gain!Granite Lake is lovely and a very nice place to take a breather.There are two peaks:The northern peak has better views of emerald bay. I did not see a clear trail to this peak.The southern peak is about 200ft higher in elevation, has better views of desolation wilderness. The trail to this peak is very clear.Dog friendly!', 'A little steep at some points, but views at the end make it worth it', 'Great view from the top!', 'This is an amazing hike! Anyone with some hiking experience can do it w/o a problem! It drizzled all the time but we still enjoy it very much! On a clear day the views must be breathtaking as they were on a rainy day!

Great incline.', 'Awesome trail! Well worth the effort! My wife and I hiked it with our 3 daughters, 4, 8, and 10. Took just a hair over 2 hours to get to the peak. Absolutely breathtaking views.

My Garmin clocked it at 4.5mi and about 1,400ft elevation gain...took us 3 hours round trip.

It is very steep almost the whole way. My asthma wasn’t having any of it. But we made it to granite lake and it was totally worth it. Gorgeous lake, and amazing views on the way up.', 'Hard incline (for an inexperienced hiker), but worth it for all of the views. The trailhead is through the campground, and there is parking for it there, but it fills up fast. You can also park across the highway at Inspiration Point, and a lot of people park along the highway.Granite Lake is a great place to stop and cool down (I saw people swimming too). A lot of switchbacks before an awesome view of Maggie’s Peaks, but the way back is all downhill.Make sure to wear good hiking shoes with good tread, I was slipping and sliding in my sneakers (not well prepared).', 'Really enjoyed this hike. we started at 9am to beat the heat and traffic. The views are amazing.', ""Granite lake is such a beautiful lake. The reflection of surrounding trees on the green-blue water was spectacular. The extra hour or so hike from granite lake to Maggie's peaks was also totally worth it because from the top, I could see Lake Tahoe, Emerald Bay, Granite Lake, and two other lakes. We also saw an eagle fly upwards what we hiked for 2 hours in 10 seconds. This was overall a very impressive hike. Definitely elevation gain involved."", 'We’re from Texas. Elevation nothing. It was a gorgeous hike! We only hiked up to the lake, about 1.25 miles. However, we hiked around the lake to the other side over the little ridge there. Offers stunning views of Lake Tahoe. Worth the hike around the lake and up a little further.', 'Gorgeous views. Granite Lake is pristine and well worth the stop to swim and relax before continuing the climb. Definitely worth the push at the end for the panoramic views!', 'Brilliant hike. Did it with 3 kids (9, 12 and 15). My gps says 8km all in all.', 'Great hike we have older children they loved it beautiful views', 'Super pretty hike the whole way through! First mile or so is all incline but it’s a relatively smooth trail for a while. Great views!', 'Amazing views from the peak.  The trail to  the peaks is left, off the trail that goes down into Desolation. Just follow the stacked rocks.  Snow basically gone for the season. Excellent place to have your lunch or just look down into Cascade,Fallen Leaf and Tahoe.  Also a great view of Tallac.  Trailhead parking goes fast so get there early.', 'Great hike with amazing views at the end. Last push to the top was a little tricky due to snow, but just went straight up. Grade is gradual to the end so quite doable.', 'Great hike with amazing views. There was snow towards the top, but easy to get around.', 'Did this trail on 5.23.18.

The view of desolation wilderness from Maggie’s peak saddle spot was amazing as was the view from the very top.', 'Completed on 2/18/18. Used microspikes for a little more than half of the hike, snowshoes for about the last quarter mile. Saw many people without spikes or snowshoes that were hiking so doable just harder. Great views at the top.', ""Absolutely stunning views. Hiked this 1/6/18, there's snow past granite lake and the last 1/4 is about 1' deep. It was worth it."", 'Be prepared. Icy in spots but lots of snow at top.', 'Great trail! There was lots of snow and beautiful views!', 'Beautiful trail! The lake on the way to the top is great and there are a lot of early vistas to keep you interested. In late November there was a significant amount of snow as you move past the lake and towards the top though so definitely wear hiking boots and start earlier than us (1pm) if you’re trying to go to the top.', 'A nice out and back hike. However, do not underestimate the gain involved with this one. Even though it’s a relatively short hike in horizontal distance it’s almost entirely straight up and then straight back down. The trail is loose soil most of the way along switch backs that zig zag up through forests and then chaparral. The trail is easy to follow until you get to the final ascent. At the last junction you basically turn south and find your way up to the top. There are some indications of trail but you’ll have to find your own way mostly. There are cairns that have been setup but they are hard to see and you must pay close attention to find them. But if you do you’ll know you’re on the right path. You’ll be greeted by an altar of granite boulders which provide a great platform to view granite lake, cascade lake, emerald bay and South Lake Tahoe. Reverse your steps and find your way back down. 1.5hrs up (with a 10 minute break) ~50mins down.', 'Great views, well worth it!', 'Great views throughout!', 'Beautiful hike with rewarding views.

Easy to follow and convenient parking at the trail head. Be prepared for solid elevation climb with relatively no flat spots until you reach Granite Lake where you can take a moment to stare up the lake towards Maggie's peak (south). Proceeded further up again to amazing 360 degree views of Tahoe side and deeper into the Desolation Wilderness side. Would recommend. After returning and feeling like I could go a bit further I bypassed the parking lot and kept going the left at the trailhead to Cascade Falls. Worth the additional views for the relatively easy short hike."", ""For views of Emerald Bay, this has got to be one of the best lookouts.  It is a steep but relatively short climb up to the top of Maggie's Peak.  The small alpine lake is a great halfway point of the hike that offers a place to sit, cool off, or snack. Once to the top, you have great views of desolation wilderness, emerald bay, fall leaf lake, etc.  great views!Parking can be tough on weekends, go early!"", ""Trail starts with some part walking in through the campground. There is a sign at the trailhead which says cascade falls and desolation. If you are planning to go for Maggie's peak, take desolation side. It's pretty streneous hike. Uphill all the time. We reached the top in about 2.5 hrs, we took our time through the trail. Coming down is very easy. Takes  about 3 to 4 hrs. You get to see many lakes during the hike. Granite lake is so cool. Its really steep hike but rewarding views at the top. I would recommend it to anyone interested in good afternoon hike, lots of shade. Bring lots of water.  Totally worth it! you will not regret."", ""This is such a challenging yet awesome hike! It's totally worth getting to 8600 ft and get the views you'll see."", 'Epic views', ""Pretty tough trail but it's so worth the trek. Went to the very top and I am confident in saying it's one of the best views I've ever seen. It's pretty steep the whole time but nothing you can't handle if you take your time. Would recommend to anyone visiting and want to get an amazing view of a few surrounding lakes. Took a quick dip in the lake on the way up as well. You won't regret the hike."", 'You must be very fit to get all the way to the peak but it is well worth it. Took us about two and a half hours to get to the top and an hour to get down. SPECTACULAR views!', 'Straight up, the lungs burn, but its beautiful!', ""This trail is hard. Probably didn't help that I am 20 weeks pregnant. Lol It had incredible views and I highly recommend it!!"", ""I didn't go all the way to Maggie's Peak but ended turning back where you turn from the trail to get to the peak. Steep hike but was rewarded with great views."", ""Fairly steep climb which only takes about 40-50 minutes to the saddle section. If you go left up the hill, around boulders (there is no marked path), you'll get to the top of Maggie's Peak in 5 minutes. The view looking over Cascade Lake out to Lake Tahoe is incredible!"", 'Steep climb indeed. Only slightly over a mile to get to Granite Lake.', 'Killer climb right out the gate, views are amazing and a quick dip in Granite Lake made the rest of the hike perfect', ""It's a difficult, consistently steep hike to the top but it is a great hike and workout with amazing views throughout."", ""Superb. Incline is intense at points, wouldn't recommend bringing the dog unless it's used to pretty steep hikes with some points off trail"", 'Ascent is a little rough but worth the views. Bring lots of water. Amazing scenery all around. Swim at Granite Lake on your way down!', 'If there was a category for Moderate/Hard, I think the ascent on this hike would fit in that category. Great views throughout. Was surprised to have a cell signal at the top.', ""Quick high incline hike to granite lake. Set up camp and did a day hike to Maggie's Peak and Azul Lake. We were there 2 weeks ago and there was still some snow on the way to Maggie's Peak from Granite Lake but you can navigate around it. Really nice flat camping spots on the west side of the lake."", 'Phenomenal views! A work out to get all the way. Still a little snow in places at the top.', ""Quite a trip up but well worth it as you rewarded with breathtaking views of Lake Tahoe and Cascade and Fallen Leaf lakes. Last third is still covered with patches of snow so finding that last trail to Maggie's Peaks is pretty much impossible. Use your judgement and just head up. Way back continue clockwise to complete the loop via Granite lake trail. It will be all down from the peak. Strongly suggest doing it clockwise."", 'There was still snow about 1/2 mile past the lake.', 'There was still snow about 1/2 mile past lake.', ""As of 6/23 there was no snow heading to the lake.  But,  once you passed the lake to head onto Maggie Peak there was snow.  We lost the trail and worked around (some areas without snow) and through the snow to the summit (not Maggie's peak) overlooking Eagle Lake.   It was a beautiful hike!  Not too crowded either for a 85 degree blue sky day!"", 'Another great hike.', 'Great hike to Granite Lake.  Wonderful view of the Emerald Bay where we stopped for a snack.  The amount of snow near the lake is very passable.  We had the whole lake to ourselves maybe around 10 AM, there was nice reflection with snow mountain backdrop.  This is a great destination even if you do not go further.  We did go beyond the lake but turned back when it became too difficult to keep on trail.', 'We did this one on Jun 13. Snow around the lake. If you want to get in to lake, I think August is the best time.', 'Tried this June 6. Successful till Granite Lake, beyond we were unable to find the trail there was too much snow. We went back and headed to Cascade Trail.', ""Fabulous views, and although a bit of a steep incline not too challenging and totally worth it. Definitely a must do. There weren't many people when we went but I can see it being busy at times"", 'Great views, variety of terrain, and nice short hike.  Only downside is that it is a VERY popular hike so you will be passing lots of other hikers during the busy season', 'If you are looking for a shortish hike that delivers a huge variety of landscape then look no further.  Superb views of  Lake Tahoe and Desolation Wilderness from the top, takes about an hour to hike up there and it is mostly uphill but not too difficult if yu are in reasonable shape.', 'Great workout.  The top is worth every step.', 'Spectacular views!  Great cardio uphill climb!  And worth every huff and puff.', 'What a view!', ""Excellent hike! Stunning views from the Maggie's Peak and from the trail to Emerald bay, Granite lake,  Cascade and Fallen leaf lakes  and Eagle lake . Be ready for a rather steep  uphill - 1700ft. Perfect hike for afternoon - the trail was mostly shady. Granite lake halfway to the peak was beautiful too. Worth uphill efforts. Downhill is very easy and quick."", ""This trail was great yesterday! You start off at a pretty high elevation (around 7,000 ft) so a couple older people in our group really noticed how the air had thinned and made it harder for them. We started at the trailhead inside the campsite and hiked up the Granite Lake, stopped for lunch, and then proceeded upwards to Maggie's Peak. It was steep in some places but absolutely doable, and coming down is pretty fast. WARNING: We went in mid-late August and there were aggressive bees EVERYWHERE. From the beginning of the hike almost to the very end I had bees trailing me and landing on my hands and legs whenever I stopped. (I had eaten some fruit and they probably smelled it on me) Normally this wouldn't be much of a problem but if you're severely allergic to bees DO NOT hike this in late summer/early fall. I was stung twice without ever swatting or threatening a bee. Apparently they're just really aggressive right now trying to prepare for winter."", ""Great hike with wonderful views.  I'd  rate it as difficult vs moderate since it is pretty much a straight up hike.  We went to Maggie's Peak and it was well worth the extra time and effort.  Granite Lake is also beautiful.  On the day we hiked, there were few people.  The majority of people were taking the other hike at the beginning of the trail head to Cascade Falls.  Left for Cascade Falls, right to Maggie's Peak.  I'd do it again!"", '', ""Excellent half day hike.  Definitely make the effort to summit Maggie's peak, the views are outstanding.\nBe aware that while not long, this is a steady uphill climb of 1700 feet or so from the trail head to the summit (in only 1.9 miles).  You'll enjoy the way down after you make it.  Granite lake is a good stop midway for some food, or a quick splash in the cool water.  Be sure to carry water and stay hydrated."", ""I would consider this more of a hard hike. We did Susie Lake the previous day & found this one much harder even though it's shorter. You are climbing the entire time to the peak. Beautiful lake & view totally worth the climb."", 'Steep start but nice to have shade on the climbing. Worth the views, great half day hike.', ""Make sure to climb to the top of Maggie's Peak. The final 0.5 mile is steep, but it is worth it. On one side you have views of Desolate Wilderness and on the other side you have views of Lake Tahoe, Cascade Lake, Fallen Leaf Lake, and Granite Lake. On a cloudless day, this is a special hike."", ""I couldn't find Maggies Peaks on here, so I think is the closest to it. If you are in Tahoe during nice weather, I would highly recommend this hike! If you have lots of strength, climb all the way to Maggies Southern Peak (the higher one) and you will get stunning views. Granite Lake is a nice stop where we swam and cooled off before we continued onto to higher climbing! Enjoy :)"", ""Steady, upward climb. Had lunch at Granite Lake and continued upward to Maggie's Peak. Definitely worth the upward climb. Spectacular views await..\nRecommend trekking poles for the descent for those with weak knees though.."", ""A lovely hike, moderate incline. Hardest part is at the beginning. If you're open to it, the tadpoles will bite the dead skin off your feet which is super fun :) Definite recommendation, and hike the extra 0.5 miles up to Maggie's Peak for some killer views."", ""It's a great little trail. You get a nice overlook of Emerald Bay around the half way point. Continue up to Granite lake, take a swim, have lunch and hike out. Parking at Vista Point is the hard part."", 'Medium steep. Beautiful views.', ""Great trail! Definitely a climb to get to the lake but it's a beautiful high altitude lake! Totally worth it, you even get to see a cool view of emerald bay. Did this trail right after the cascade falls trail and it made for a great work out! Make sure to bring lots of water."", 'I camped at Granite Lake on the last night of a trip in Desolation. When I left there I was glad to be walking down the hill towards Tahoe as it is a long series of switchbacks down a steep grade. The lake is  a nice place for a swim and great views.', 'Great hike! Granite lake is a secret spot not for fishing but for sun bathing and taking a cool refreshing dip after a long hike. The incline is steep to the top, but well worth the views and is well away from the main crowds of weekend warriors of hikers. Parking at inspiration point is hard to find on the weekends. Hence, weekend warriors....', ""What a climb! I would not rate this hike as easy at all. You are on a steep incline for a good hour from the trail head to Ganite Lake. Gorgeous views along the way make it worth while. After stopping at the lake for lunch we continued on to Maggie's Peak, which was approx. another hour of steep inclines. The views from the top are breathtaking. You can see 3 or 4 lakes to the east and overlook Desolation Wilderness to the west as well as look down on Eagle Lake. "", ""Haven't done many hikes in Tahoe, but this one was very enjoyable. It's a moderate incline for most of the way, with some steeper parts as you reach the end. The trail was easy to follow except near Granite Lake, where there were a few trail-looking paths that weren't correct. The area at the bottom near bayview trailhead/campground was rather crowded (it was memorial day weekend), but we were able to park off the side of 89. Once we got to the trailhead, it was apparent most of the people parked were just there for the view off 89, not to hike. And from the portion of people that were hiking, the majority went to cascade lake instead of taking a right to go through Desolation Forest. It's definitely worth it to go through Desolation; fewer people and great views of emerald bay, and lake tahoe as a whole. It was a bit unnerving when we reached the end of the trail, there was a good amount of snow leftover from the recent snowfall, but we figured we made it that far, might as well keep climbing. And it was well worth it. The view from the top of Maggie's Peak is incredible, and the pictures don't quite do it justice. You can see nearly everything: North Lake Tahoe, Cave Rock, Heavenly/Stateline, Emerald Bay and great views of the some of the mountains toward the west, as well as the nearby lakes. I used the Everytrail iPhone app to make sure we were going the right way and staying on the trail and it worked great. If looking for a moderately challenging hike with great views and a great sense of accomplishment reaching the top, I highly recommend this one."", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '',

We also shoed across the length of Lower Echo. Powder is deep in spots, and the lake is mostly frozen. Absolutely enchanting. Such a gorgeous hike. Today’s weather was terrific, along with ideal road conditions.', 'Went up yesterday & it was very snowy!! Totally beautiful though maybe not all cars could make it on the snow covered road to get to the lake.', 'Beautiful lakes; nice easy to follow trail; interesting granite formation; only thing missing is a waterfall', 'Easy and pretty, perfect for acclimating to the elevation. We cut down to Upper Echo Lake and relaxed there for a bit.', 'This was such a wonderful easy hike. Great for families with kids. Our 8 year old did it with a little help on the way back.', 'Nice easy to moderate hike with lovely views. A little busy on a Sunday but it was also a holiday weekend. Try to go early! No smoke from fires when we went today (11/11/2018)', 'Great hike', 'Loved this trail, went during the off season and was able to have the trail to ourselves. Easy walk, beautiful views. Took us 1 hour and 15 minutes to get to the furthest lake and around 3 hours (with side hikes) to complete. You can get this trail done in 2 hours if you go straight there and back.', 'Echo Lake is one of the best easy hikes in Tahoe but past Upper Echo Lake is not my favorite because it has lots of scree which makes it challenging to keep your footing while enjoying the view.   Ankle support is a must on Upper Echo Lake section.   Views are tops & lakes are plentiful past Upper Echo.  Heavily trafficked.  Lots of climbing on rock steps.  Not much shade so avoid in July.', 'Beautiful hike! Very exposed and important to bring sunscreen. Lots of views of the lake. We went during the week in the afternoon and there was barely anyone else there. Took our dog down to the lake for a swim and didn’t see a soul! Water taxi no longer running for the season. But it’s a pretty easy hike with slow elevation gains.', 'Heads up. The lake is low so the water taxi will likely be closing before the usual date of Labor Day. Call the Echo Chalet ahead of time if the water taxi option is important to you', 'Beautiful views, moderately challenging, a good workout.', 'Overall nice trail. Some great spots to go swim. Although it is more than moderately trafficked, on a Monday it was a busy trail. I can’t imagine the weekends.', 'This is an amazing hike. I went out and back from echo lake trailhead to tamarack lake in 4 hours. It’s a hell of a hike without much shade. There aren’t any steep climbs but don’t expect a nice dirt trail as it’s mostly rocks. Nice views along echo lake.', 'Beautiful hike. Lower and upper lake taxi tour is a fun extra. Hiked the PCT to Tamarak lack last year. There was still a lot of snow so we trekked back earlier than expected. Will do this one again for sure!', 'Nice trail. Beautiful views.', 'Go early and wear sunscreen, and you will love this trail. I don’t usually like out and back trails but this is a highlight of our week. I’m not sure you can find an empty trail in late July so we were thrilled that it was such light traffic. Also, the adventurous can go beyond the lake for a longer trip.  Those who are tired can do the water taxi return for $14. Highly recommend.', 'super busy trail, get there early cause parking is sparse.  Lots of good trails nearby. An easy place to set your feet on the PCT.', 'Great trail with great views of Lower and Upper Echo Lake. Just wish there wasn’t so many cabins along the shoreline.', 'I did this hike last summer it had a nice view when you get the the top but it was right next to houses and cabins and lots of people. Took away from why I hike. Beautiful yes and fun to swim because you need too considering this is VERY exposed. No shade. It was okay but I wouldn’t do it again . The boat taxi back though was fun. So that’s also an option if you don’t want to hike all the way back', 'Great moderate hike with awesome views. Go early to avoid most of the other hikers. We went mid July and there were plenty of wild flowers to add to the many photo ops. This trail has a lot of loose and uneven rocks so wear shoes with good solid soles and our hiking poles came in handy. There is a little store at the trail head were you can get lunch or a treat after the hike.', 'Very nice view along the lake. Not much elevation. can take the water taxi back for 14 dollars.', 'Nice scenic trail for an early morning but too crowded thereafter. A good cut-in to the wilderness/PCT/Aloha.', 'Go as far as you need and then turn around. Fantastic views!', 'Hiked in mid-June.  Cute lakes and cabins and pretty easy walking though rocky in places.  Good for kids.  Would go again.', 'Nice easy section of PCT but area is very populated and overbuilt. Much nicer once you pass the Desolation Wilderness sign.', 'Beautiful hike in late May above the shore of Lower and Upper Echo Lakes. It offers a spectacular view looking back.  We hiked to Tamarack Lake, but left too late to make it to Lake Aloha. If you want to do that, leave early, around 7, to get a parking spot and a good start. The water taxi offers shortcuts, but it’s $14 each way.  On the trail and around Tamarack Lake, we logged 11 miles.  We plan to return to hike to Lake Aloha.', 'It was beautiful and easy with kids.', 'A beautiful hike along the shore. There was some small climbing but definitely doable. A good mix of sun and shade. I believe what makes this a moderate hike is the distance. At the end there are some benches along the shore and a water taxi to bring you back to the start if needed. Also, the trail gets busy as the day goes on so I would start early.', 'Quick scouting trip today - just a couple miles in and back along Echo Lake. Nice trail, fairly flat in this section. We look forward to returning soon so we can hike all the way back into Aloha Lake.', 'Nice trail, quite rocky in places.  Very  scenic.', 'Great hike. Easy in and out. Totally doable for kids.

Easy trail. It's also part of PCT and TRT!"", 'Unfortunately he road was impassible and we could not get there. April 26,2018', 'Beautiful hike with incredible views of the lake the entire way. Would definitely recommend it! Went during first week of February and the trail was snow covered but easily walkable in regular hiking boots (though notably this was after a week of no snow and 50 degree temps). Note that you have to turn off the main road and drive an additional 1+ mile to get to the actual trail head- would need all wheel drive to do this, at least during the winter. Otherwise can park in the lot right off the paved road and walk to the trail head. You have to have a Sno-Park permit to park there between November and May. This can be purchased at nearby gas stations or online and print in advance ($5 for day pass).', 'Great hike once we were on the path but it is hard to find the path.', 'The road is blocked from hw50 so it’s an additional 1.8 mile walk in the snow/ ice to the trailhead. Awesome views though.', 'Beautiful views. Very flat most of the way—not a tough hike. You’re just walking along the lake.', 'Went the second weekend in November. Perfect weather. There was some snow along the trail in higher elevations but it was still a very a nice, easy hike. Beautiful views. We only saw 1 other person on the way up (around 8 am) then didn’t see anyone for the rest of the morning. On the way back down (around noon) we encountered several people making their way up but it was spaced out enough to not be an issue. It was quiet and peaceful. Parking was no issue in the morning. Will definitely be doing this again', 'Beautiful views. You pass a lot of small cabins along the way so it is not a completely off the grid trail', 'My husband and I did a short hike on this trail as we were leaving the South Tahoe area. We just did a leisurely 3 mile out and back. The views were lovely and the trail mostly flat. The weather was in the cooler side and a bit windy, but not too bad. This was my first time on the PCT and I hope to visit it again.', 'Well maintained beautiful hike. Beautiful views.', 'Such a beautiful place ! The trail was challenging as I am not in the same condition but I still completed it slowly but surly started the hike @ echo lake @10:30am and headed to lake aloha ended back at the parking by 7:09pm super sore but worth it !   The bad new I lost my black and gold Ray bans on my way down :(', 'great terrain, absolutely beautiful views the entire hike.', 'Perfect day packing trip. amazing views throughout hike and the trail is nicely groomed.', 'Took this trail in the late afternoon to the fork between the two lakes, pretty level the whole way, but easy to get off the path. Nice cabins you can view along the way.', 'Today is the perfect day for hiking, sunny and cool enough. Everything just is perfect.', ""Entered at Echo Lake and exited at Eagle Falls/Emerald Bay over five days and it was spectacular.  Lake access and views every night from Lake Aloha to Gilmore Lake to Dick's Lake.  This was a section of the TRT and the PCT that I would recommend all day long.  Great midweek trek long after the PCT'ers were gone so we had a good bit of the real estate to ourselves.  Dick's Pass had plenty of snow as did the lake and elevations over 8k.  No fires in the Desolation Wilderness was the only bummer."", 'Gorgeous views of the lakes, we did the extra 2 miles or so to Tamarack. Easy hike, but not much shade so it gets hot! Parking is a shit show. Cute little community of cabins all around the lake, love it!', 'Love this walk.  Beautiful view of the lake and a great little boat ride back if you choose!', ""It's on the easy side of moderate, partly shady, and absolutely beautiful!  We arrived about 8:30 am today - Sunday - and the parking areas were pretty packed."", 'Hiked to Upper and Lower lakes. Arrived about 10 am on a Tuesday and parking lot and road sides were full. Very popular place but the trail was not overly crowded. Beautiful snow-free hike and a great spot to cool off', 'July 12. A beautiful high Sierra hike! Magnificent mountain and lake views, old grove trees, manzanita and wild flowers!  Nice areas to swim off of the rocks, but you will have to go off trail.  Take plenty of water, sunscreen and insect repellent if you want to hang out in the shade. A ""plan B"" option is to take the water taxi on the return from the west end of the lower lake, check with the marina for more details.', 'Best hike yet! Views of echo lake the whole hike. Great for families and pets. The 2.5 mile hike takes you to a boat taxi that will take you back to the trailhead or you can simply turn around at that point and go back totaling your hike at 5 miles. Pet friendly. Will do again!', '', 'I usually hike back to Aloha. Awesome trail with amazing views', 'Hidden Gem: Hit the trailhead at 9:30am. Bathrooms are available with a small store nearby. We did an out-n-back by 1:30pm with plenty of time to head off-trail and enjoy some of the many creeks and upper echo lake shore. This trail has a lot of sun exposure and I would suggest packing a 2L water bladder (which is more than enough).  I packeda 20lb Osprey Talon and a DSLR camera without issues.  We did not head into Desolation but plenty of folks were trudging out there.  Wear mosquito repellant and good shoes and socks.  Make sure you fill out your day pass and have fun.', ""Great trail with views all the way out and back.  You can take water taxi but you are here to hike so we enjoyed that.  Went to Desolation Sign and back.  My wife's new favorite trail!"", 'This is our new favorite hike.  We came last Monday and brought family back today.  You have  views the entire way,  and a nice little picnic area up at Upper Echo to relax at before heading back.', ""This is a great trail! I don't hike very often, and it was perfect for me. Great lake views the whole way. Some parts are narrow and require walking over rocks, but was very doable. Parking can be challenging on busy weekends so arrive early. We had a great time!"", 'Very nice hike that runs fairly close to a couple of beautiful lakes. We made at to the end of both echo lakes but turned just after due to water and snow hazards.', 'Beautiful hike and lake, and there is still a few patches of snow!!!', ""We went on April 30. (5.6 miles total) Parked at the Sno-Park and snowshoed to lower Echo Lake. Tried to find the PCT, but no luck, as the snow is still deep. Trekked up to Flagpole Peak and back down, had lunch on the boat dock. Saw backpackers snowshoeing across the west side of the lake, but since the east side was starting to thaw, I didn't think it was a good idea for us to try. Hoping to get back soon, so we can get to upper Echo Lake."", 'Great Hike, \nIn the winter you must park at the snow park and hike in. This added 1.2 miles each direction.\nHeavy avalanche control bombing was going on and the  Lake was frozen over. It was very cool to see frozen!\nWe decided not to brave the PCT trail due to the fresh snow and possible risk of avalanche.', 'Breathtaking right from the start', 'Beautiful, and a nice challenge as well.', 'Lake was very pretty and mountains are cool.  Did this on a Monday and not very crowded. Would do it again.', 'Hiked it today  started early  a little cold  always a great hike   Walked all the way around upper echo and then back to Pct and back to truck  lotta people on trail  great time', 'It was fun and an amazing experienced for us. Great hike! It was the first hike for one of our friend and she loved it!', 'Beautiful views.', 'Easy hike along the lake.  Pretty busy trail (we saw a ton of people) but nice lake views the entire time.', ""Gorgeous views. The trail is rocky but relatively flat. The toughest part is making sure you don't twist your ankle. We took the water taxi back and that was a treat. It shows a different perspective. Lovely and worth it."", 'Really enjoyed this trail. Mostly gradual inclines and flat areas, so it was great for my dog and I to go on our own. There was a thunderstorm while we were hiking, which made it even better!', ""Our family of all ages does this hike every year. It's beautiful. We picnic and swim in the upper lake. Can water taxi in and/or out which is great for bringing in coolers etc. You can rent kayaks, has a small store/ deli with ice cream!  The kids love it at the end of the day. Closes at 5pm. Water taxi closed at 4:30. I recommend a hiking stick for unsteady people,  a lot of uneven surfaces. Usually crowded. Bathrooms at the beginning of the trail. Must have your personal Kayak inspected ahead of time to bring it in Echo Lake."", 'Beautiful lake and granite trails, but crowded and noisy from all the boats.', ""My wife and I (and dog) went hiking here and loved it. Parking and bathrooms at the start are nice. The 2.5 mile hike in is overlooking he lake the whole way. Upper Echo lake was pretty empty when we were there (August) and the water was great for swimming. They have a water taxi there as well in case you don't want to hike back."", 'Great day!!!!  The first hike we have done as a family.  Our son is 7.5 and he made it toUpper Echo Lake and back so kid friendly.  Great views and nice people.', 'Great hike. Lots of scenic views.

We hiked 10 miles in and out.', ""Great hike! You can expand it if you're feeling ambitious or shorten it with a $14 water taxi ride"", 'Overnight hike to Tamarack was amazing!  Beautiful views, full of small waterfalls.  Great first overnight hike for kids.  Took our friend and 7 yr old with us.  $14 boat ferry ride each way if needed.', 'Great hike, usually our first Tahoe hike every year.  Pretty easy hike and you can get a good gauge for the level of the snow for future hiking in the next few weeks.  Lots of snow at 8300 feet last weekend on 6/5/16.  Trail is full of water run off from the snow especially as you get closer to Tamarak Lake.', 'was an awesome day perfect weather perfect hike', ""Great hike. Go early because it gets busy! A great get away from the heat in the valley. Still a little snow on the ground but I imagine it'll be gone soon."", 'Great hike. Had to add an additional mile as the access road was closed due to snow.  Easy trail to follow with fantastic lake and mountain views.', 'Great hike for being one of my first legit ones I suppose, not to bad went around beginning of August if I remember. Weather was nice had some rain for like an hour then back to clear skies, actually ended up hiking like an extra mile to the next lake which was pretty fun.', ""This was one of my first official hikes! It's constant beautiful scenery, plenty of photo opportunities and a neat, rocky trail. It took longer than I expected but I enjoyed every minute."", 'Love this trail! Great for kids or beginners. High traffic the first mile or so in but then it thins out.', ""Started at Echo Lake and went to the junction with the Echo Peak Trail on up to the peak itself. Added a bit of a side trip to Flag Pole Peak. Some of the group made it, others of us decided we'd had enough for that day. Total trip time was approximately 7 hours for 13 miles plus the break for lunch and at the peak. Great views of Echo Lakes, Lake Tahoe, Fallen Leaf, and a number of others."", 'Excellent backpacking trip with my daughters, their first overnighter. Set up camp in the woods just beyond Tamarak lake right between Ralston and Cagwin lakes. The trail is fairly flat and easy, even if you have to carry one of your kids backpacks.. (good thing she packed light) We cheated on the way back in with the water taxi, but overall a great experience and perfect setting.', 'Had a wonderful day hike. Very nice seeing Echo Lakes from the trail. Would like to backpack overnight to Aloha Lake next time.', 'Relaxing hike with some great scenery', ""The hike from echo to Aloha Lake is really nice. It's not very difficult as a day hike. Leave early enough to be able to visit Lake of the Woods, which I find prettier than Aloha. Although dogs can enjoy this trail, it is REALLY rocky. If your dog's pads aren't quite tough already, she'll be hurting by the time you're done."", ""I went in June. Beauty everywhere.  Flowering meadows, primeval forests, cool rock formations stream crossings and a good little workout. You'll run into Super buff PCT people who are doing Canada to Mexico.   Loved it. Watch out. You could lose the trail if not cautious."", 'Loved this trail, very crowded at the lower end of trail but gets less congested the farther in you go.  Beautiful views of the lake but no easy access to it until miles into the hike, so bring plenty of water for the dogs.', 'Very nice hike. Easy day trip, had lunch at Tamarack and hiked back. No boat ride for us.', 'Beautiful hike. Views of many lakes. Trail is pretty rocky in spots, but that just makes it interesting. We went to lake aloha. Probably one of the most beautiful mountain lakes ive ever seen.', 'Go early in the day as the parking lot fills up quickly!  Beautiful views.  Took the water taxi back (still $12/per person) for some ground-level views.  There was still a dusting of snow on the peaks, so the snowmelt made the rocky parts of the trail pretty slippery.\nThe trail head splits off and was a little confusing for a first timer to find the one we wanted so our group had to ask other hikers if we were on the right track.  The elevation also got to me as it was difficult to get moving again after breaks.  Overall it was an excellent trail!', 'A nice easy hike with beautiful lake views the whole way. We went in November, it was chilly but no snow. Beautiful pictures!', ""Oustanding and beautiful views.  Went the first weekend in April.  Dress accordingly, winds were over 40 mph for the entire length of the trail, base tempearature at 21 degrees, with a wind chill factor of below zero.   Really made it miserable, but i have to give the views and trail 5 stars.  Also, if you're not used to it, you'll need time to acclimate to hiking at 8,000 feet."", ""This area has to be one of the most beautiful spots in Lake Tahoe- and I lived here for a year and a half! Year-around it is great for hiking, snowshoeing, and even ice skating. You can hike to Emerald Bay, Aloha Lake, and even to Canada from here. However, I recommend just hiking from the trail head to Tamarack Lake. It is easy but watch your ankles, there are some loose rocks and I can see people rolling their ankles easily if they aren't careful. Also be aware of crowds! Due to easy access/water taxi, it is a popular destination. Arrive early to get guaranteed parking. During the summer there is a water taxi ($12 each way, Memorial Day-Labor Day) that will take you from the south end to Upper Echo Lake. It saves you about 1-2 hours of hiking but that's cheating :P\n\nThis area is perfect for backpacking treks, day trips, swimming, rock scrambling, rock climbing, and just plain ol' fun. Oh, and did I mention it's gorgeous and perfect for your Instagram feed?"", ""Its amazingly beautiful! I've been hiking all over Tahoe national forest, desolation wilderness, national parks, state parks, etc and this is now one of my top 3 favorites!

I look forward to doing it again with friends to see their amazement too!"", 'its 4 miles from the dam to tamarack lake   ,about 2 hours on rocky terrain. easy to hard when you get past the upper lake.  take the water taxi  if you want to get into the wilderness it will save you 3 to 4 hours.  last boat returns a 6 pm', 'Rare views and beautiful campsites, a fairly challenging trail even for the moderately experienced. The water taxi is well worth it! The alternate trail is not too horribly difficult and the views are nice, but combined with the rest of the hike and a 60lb backpack your gonna wish you took the taxi by the end of it. No bears at least on my trip, and a bear can is optional, I recommend bringing something to keep the chipmunks out if your bringing food. Also makes a decent day hike! Fairly challenging bring lots of water!!', 'BEAUTIFUL hike once you get up there. The water taxi to the trail head to Lake Aloha was 12$, very steep but pretty worth it. The water at the top is super refreshing and the views are marvelous. The people who work at the little store right on the bank of Echo Lake are extremely nice and very helpful. Bring lots of water!', ""The trail is not 12 miles, it's 6 roundtrip to the end of the second lake, at which point you need a permit to hike past the Desolation Wilderness boundary. Permits are located at the trailhead."", 'I did this hike several years ago. Beautiful. I took the water taxi which was pleasant in itself and also affords you more time to hike farther into the wilderness. I went up to lake Aloha. I seem to remember the taxi was cheaper then ($10?) than it is now according to another reviewer. Anyway you go though - gorgeous area.', 'Hiked the trail twice so far and has been pleasant every time! Easy terrain and very picturesque views of both lakes. Get there early because it is a zoo later in the day when all the crowds show up. Good for families and people not looking for hardcore trails.', 'Killer hike! We went about 1.5 miles in. Trail up to that point was pretty easy, mostly flat. ', 'INCREDIBLE hike!  Just absolutely BEAUTIFUL views all along this trail.

After you cross the dam there is a high trail (right) AND a low trail (left).  Took the high but too strenuous.  Had to scale rock faces to get down to lower trail, very tricky and scary!  Water taxi was available but did not use.  Cost was $13/person, but a $36 min.  So for just 2 it would be $18/person.

Amazing rushing river in early June. Love this park! Watch out for snakes on the trail.', ""It was 45 F when we started this hike at 0830 on 10/4/18. It had poured rain the previous day and ice warnings were in the forecast which I think scared everyone away. We saw no one on the way up and only a handful of people on the way back. The temperature never got warm enough to where the bugs were a problem even though we were prepared with head nets and bug spray. The first part of the hike was through the valley with gorgeous views on either side. After the junction to the Bubb's creek trail the trail begins a gradual ascent up to the falls. There is a section where you come out of the trees and you have unimpeded views of the canyon that are pretty spectacular. If you're a photographer, a wide angle lens is a must (or take multiple photos and stitch them together in post, or just take a panorama w/ your camera phone). Right before we got to the falls ran into a cinnamon colored black bear and her cub. That was a treat. The falls themselves are not spectacular as far as falls go, but it's a convenient turn around point.  On the return we followed the Bubbs Creek trail across the river then took the spur back to the trailhead. Not as scenic as the trail coming out, but it was flat and easy.  A pretty easy hike with a high ROE (return on effort)."", 'A very good trail with moderate traffic. Went on a Saturday morning and continued along the same trail until Paradise Valley. The extra bit was well worth it, with very good views and a nice calm part of the Kings River. Did not see any bears, although we heard one growling nearby.', 'Hiked 10/11/18. As great as advertised. Arrived at the trailhead around 8:30am. Plenty of spaces available. Bugs weren’t a problem. We extended the hike an extra mile+ after the falls. That added quite a bit of elevation gain. Ran into a mama bear and her cub cruising down the middle of the trail and heard another just off trail.', 'Wonderful and spectacular trail! Insects not a problem, no large wildlife sightings today.', 'Read reviews here before driving to the park for this hike.  They were right on.  I sprayed myself with repellant as soon as I parked and had no problems all day.  Could see others being driven off the trail by the bugs.  Park in one of two lots at end of Road. This is an easy hike which you can make as difficult as you want by going uphill to the Falls and past. Talked with some other hikers and a seasonal ranger on the hike and it was great. There was no wind so it was going to get hot there in afternoon away from the water. Once to the Falls we were about to have lunch when a small bear visited the falls area and gave everyone a thrill. Trail up from falls is not easy and we decided to turn around and save the meadows to another day.\nVirtual Treadmill video of this hike can be seen on my YouTube Channel, copy and paste link below to watch it. Thanks. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFO02nxPdM4-CabegFIPlow?view_as=subscriber', 'Hiked here couple days ago with my parents. We started the hike a little later than anticipated. Got some amazing pictures of the falls once we got to the destination. On the way back we were very fortunate and were able to see a couple owls and a black bear :). Great hike, and definitely recommend it to anybody.', 'Super nice trek - the first half is basically a stroll through the forest, the incline starts after the bridge at Bubbs Creek and goes up steadily about 8/900 feet of the next couple of miles. I came across a bear with her cub about 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile before the falls, they stayed in the area around the trail for awhile, because they were still there when I came back a couple of hours later. Gnats and mosquitoes was a pest from about a mile in and almost all the way to the falls, bring a face/hat net, you will be happy you did. It was a rater hot day, even though most of this hike is in the shade of trees, I used about 4 liters of water - good thing the hike is right next to the river. An easy day hike and the beginning of the clock wise Rae Lakes Loop, most day hikers turn around at the falls.', 'Nice trail. Not super difficult. Be sure to bring a bug net and spray. The gnats are relentless. Saw a bear and her cubs, so be aware.', 'Great trail, decent amount of shades, beautiful mist fall was very refreshing.  A lot of bugs especially in the morning from the moment you get out of a car.  I encountered a mama bear followed by a bear cub.', 'A very nice trail - not too hard either. I encountered two bear cubs, but no mother was seen. Scary, but fun! Ensure you bring bug spray, you will absolutely need it.', 'Besides the mosquitos and gnats it was great', 'BUGS BUGS BUGS! Definitely need a netted hat to keep away from bugs. The best views comes after the mist falls as we go top after a series of switch backs. Overall a good hike and with great falls and views', 'Great hike overall. Especially loved the constant change of scenery. We saw a brown bear and her cub on the way up, was incredible! The only downside were the bugs, so bring repellent.', 'Started at Zumwalt Meadow and extended our hike to include the trail to Bailey’s bridge. From Bailey’s bridge, we began the climb to Mist Falls. We encountered gnats and mosquitoes throughout the entire 12.8 miles. More pleasant wildlife encounters included a bear, a mule train,  and a snake.  Although the granite stairway to Mist Falls was tough, it was totally worth it to see waterfall.', 'the nuisance of bugs was minor compared to the overall hike.  great views.  just challenging enough.  looking forward to exploring the other trails in the area', 'Great hike! You get a little bit of everything with this hike and you are almost always within ear shot of the river. When you get to the falls, the mist from it is quite invigorating and refreshing!', 'Loved this one!', 'Great trail! Can be heavily trafficked on certain days. Kings Canyon does not disappoint. Absolutely beautiful! Even with the smoky skies from California wildfires. Take bug spray, the mosquitoes can be relentless.', ""This trail is amazing. I would definitely recommend going past mist falls into paradise valley though. Not an extreme amount of climbing after the falls and is totally worth it. It's an entirely new world there and only adds about 3-4 miles onto your trip. Can get kind of crowded and buggy but definitely a must see when in Kings Canyon!"", 'Amazing hike. Totally recommended. Not very high but with amazing views.We took the loop back and saw 3 dears, so beautiful! You should do it, take your time and enjoy beautiful views!!', 'Very nice hike...wasn’t crowded at all when we went (10:00am on a Friday). My wife and I took our time on this hike exploring all along the way...in the end this hike took us 6 hours to hike to the falls and back. When you arrive at Mist Falls (to the actual sign announcing Mist Falls) know that there is a path that isn’t marked that can take you down to the water where you can get close to the Falls. This is where we had our lunch. On our last 3 miles on the way back it started to rain on us. We had decided to take the loop back which was a much different scenic view than the first leg leaving the trail head (if you have the time I recommend this route back). As all the other comments stated...lots and lots of mosquitos for the first two miles or so.', 'Great trail with beautiful scenery. Lots if water and falls. The first mile is quite flat, exposed and boring.  If hiking in the evening, apply bug repellent or wear a bug screen.  Very easy trail, that gets tougher once you pass the falls and head toward Paradise Valley. .', 'Definitely a hike that anyone visiting Kings Canyon/Sequoia NP should take. The trail is rather easy in the beginning as it winds through the forest with the South Fork King’s River to your right for the majority of the trip. But for all the beauty you experience you WILL be eaten alive by bugs. Even with frequent spraying of bug spray they managed to get every inch of me. About 2 miles in if you take the right fork you can get some beautiful views off a suspension bridge over the river. Shortly after this portion you will begin your climb. Of course with the gain in elevation you will see many smaller falls off to your right that you will been keen to snap some photos of. The falls are clearly marked on the trail by a sign and you can either continue the trail to the upper portion of the falls or relax at the bottom. The cool mist is so refreshing and offers a wonderful atmosphere to have lunch.', 'Terrible first mile, the trail is covered with sand/crushed granite and it exhausting to walk in but the rest of the hike is gorgeous!', 'It was a decently hot day and no real good shade for first couple of miles. the trail is sandy then becomes rocky. slight grade uphill until the top but does have variation so it decreases the difficulty. there were spots all along the trail to hop in the water or cool yourself down. the views all the way there were amazing. complaints are the squitos. yuck, even with bug repellant. the falls were beautiful and there were lots of space to sit back an enjoy. wish we would have seen some wildlife but only lizards and squirrels. beautiful, moderate day hike. bring lots of water!', 'Let me preface by saying that I was unable to make it to the waterfall due to a knee injury and the climb at the end would have been too much for me.I honestly would have given this hike 4-5 stars (even without making it to the waterfall-it’s that gorgeous) if it weren’t for the awful sandy part in the beginning. It literally felt like we were walking on beach sand. Which is fine at first, but gets really old, really fast. Especially on tired legs as you’re coming back.Otherwise, it was beautiful! Great views the whole way. The river was gorgeous. Fairly gradual climb until the end. Bring lots of water if you go in the summer! It was in the 90s when we went and we felt every bit of that. Also bring lots of bug spray. They were relentless! Not a lot of shade for a good portion of the beginning (the awful sandy part) so keep that in mind if you go in the summer. We hiked this on 6/20/18.', ""Excellent hike. Great views of the canyon and the falls, with a decent amount of shade. I went yesterday (June 2018), and even though the parking lot was overflowing, the trail didn't seem that busy. I think the length depends on which way you go though. I went out and back, instead of in a loop, and it was a little over 9 miles. Still a good day hike though, and I finished in about 4 hours.The main reason it didn't get 5 stars is that there are a LOT of bugs. Even with bug spray, I still got bit, so come prepared!"", 'A fun trail but definitely some mosquitos in the summer so bring bug spray.', 'Great views! Parking lot was full but we saw very few people on the trail. As we were returning, we crossed the Bailey Bridge and finished the hike on the “Kanawyer trail”.  We preferred the trail on that side of the river. If you use that side you do have to walk a little further to reach the bridge to Zumwalt Meadow. I didn’t see any wildlife or notice the mosquitoes.', 'We hiked this trail yesterday 6/25/18. It’s a great hike! We saw a Momma bear with 2 cubs. The falls  and the views are outstanding! The mosquitoes were bad at spots. Use bug spray.', 'I loved this hike, we saw a lot of wildlife. We saw two rattlesnakes and a bear which was amazing. Others around us on the trail also talked about seeing other rattlesnakes, so watch your step! When we saw a bear, there was a ranger around who instructed us when to walk, and to walk fast. Overall, it was a nice hike, pretty flat with great views.', 'The first 2 or so miles are completely flat. The only thing that makes this a moderate is the distance. Lots of stairs, but completely doable. Make sure to use bug spray, and bring it with you to reapply!', 'Great day hike.  A few places along the river had smoldering prescribed burns. No problems with bugs at noon.  Busy trail, never seen this many people on the trails other than at General Grant and Sherman.  Pack plenty of water and snacks.  Not a long hike but temps at mid-seventies, can dehydrate fast and steep elevation at the end can sap energy reserve. My loop took 3.5 hrs and I am in decent fitness condition.  check out my pics.', ""Wonderful trail with breathtaking views of Kings Canyon! \nWe started out early and were alone at the Mist Falls. Hiking the trail took us just over 4 hours, including an extensive break at the falls.\nFYI: There were a lot of mosquitos on the first section of the trail, so I'd recommend bringing repellent."", 'Fun trail with great views of massive rock cliffs that runs next to a scenic river.   Mist falls is very impressive and a good spot for a snack.   The bugs weren’t bad today, but it was slightly warmer with a mild breeze.   One downside is the time it takes to get to the trailhead if you’re not staying close (we came from Sequoia National Park).', 'This “trail” should just be and out and back instead of a loop. We crossed the bridge on the way backto complete the loop but when we came to the point where the AllTrails map shows you can cross the river to enter the parking lot we we were unable to cross. Little did we know they open up the damn in the afternoon causing the river to rise, making it impassible. Other than the frustration of the 6 mile detour it was a beautiful hike. It can be done in 4 hours with plenty of time to hang out and take pictures if you make it an out and back. We did come across a nice size rattle along the way so be on the lookout, blends in with the trail. Also we got up close and personal with a bear blocking the trail which was pretty cool to see.', ""One of the most beautiful hikes I have been on! We left at 2:00 pm on a sunny day so bugs were not at all an issue. There is plenty of shade for most of the trail so it never got too hot either. There were a couple of false alarms on Mist Falls, as there are some smaller falls, so don't stop until you see the placard. It is a must-do if you go to the park!\n\nNotes: \nNo bathroom on trail\nBring plenty of water - there is a bottle refill station at the entrance\nBring a light raincoat if you plan to spend any time at the actual falls\nBring sunscreen and bug spray (or long sleeves and hat netting)\nWear shoes you don't mind getting wet and muddy (Ours were fine but there were a few muddy spots and saw the terrain was capable of holding water after rain or snow melt)"", 'Awesome!!', 'one of the best trials. it has meadow, forest, rock, falls, river, bridge in one trial. when you reach the mist falls, do not forget look back, it is amazing. i sit there and had the lunch. awesome!', 'Great trail and beautiful views aside from the waterfall.', ""I was looking for a trail during a solo Kings/Sequoia 3 day trip and wanted to look into a nice hike I can spend majority of the day with. I picked Mist Falls over all the other trails because of the end point being a nice waterfall. Growing up near Joshua Tree NPS I anticipated the trail to be fairly barren (meaning not much to look at) until the end of the trail but this trail proved otherwise and not disappoint! The first chunk of the trail has light shade and is fairly flat, then you shift into a denser forest before you get granted with a nice walk along the Kings River. The overflow from the river does feed into the trail, which forces you to maneuver a bit more off trail expected but it was easy to find your way back. Dense forest goes into fairly open canyon stone trail with a bit of elevation gain that increases in intervals. The last mile of the trail does get a bit strenuous if you're not careful with heat and your own pacing. The waterfall, however, does not disappoint and you're treated with a nice view of the canyon.\nRound trip took about 5-6 hours including a short picnic at the end of the trail. Waterproof hiking shoes and bug spray are highly recommended!"", 'This trail is a best kept secret at Kings Canyon National Park!!! First of all, driving back to this trail has more beautiful grand views, than any views in Yosemite or Sequoia National Parks. The first half of the trail has just enough mosquitoes to drive you crazy but its easy to speed through high mosquito zone. The second half of the trail opens up and has some of the best canyon views of a fast flowing river I have ever seen. The views of the falls at the end of the trail make it well worth toughing out the mosquitoes.', ""Not too difficult but by far, one of my favorite hikes......you better like stairs though!  Make sure to pick a warm day to do this trek because it'll add to the overall beauty while keeping you energized to continue."", 'aside from getting eaten alive by bugs, it was a fantastic hike.', 'fun trail with a good payoff at the end. Great drive up to the trailhead as well.', 'Awesome trail. Killer mosquitos. Stunning views', 'I have to give it a 4 due to all the (non-biting) flies on the trail.  Otherwise, this is a definite 5-Star trail that is not too difficult, and has constant beautiful scenery.', 'Great hike with great views. Enjoy the climb!', ""Parking lot at road's end was pretty crowed for a weekday morning however once I got on the trail it was pretty empty. Lots of bugs on the trail. Pretty flat for the first two miles as it follows along the river in the canyon then makes a turn to head north still following the river and begins to climb. Along with the falls also make sure you stop at the rock outlook and look back towards an amazing view down the canyon."", 'This was such a beautiful hike!!!!!', 'The hike to the falls was scenic and well worth the trip. A must do if you are in the Cedar Grove area. As others have mentioned there are a lot of flies in the area. They do not bite, but an occasional mosquito will sneak in with the swarm. I HIGHLY recommend that you pick up a head net if planning to do this hike. The swarm of flies were heavy in the morning and relatively lite in the afternoon. Repellents do not work on these flies.', ""Beautiful drive, Amazing Hike, Breathtaking views, and lots of mosquitoes during the AM.  Bring lots of mosquitoes repellent and if possible brining a mosquitoes bet to cover your face..  we didn't bring mosquitoes face nets so we were constantly swaddling them with tree branches..  aside from that, it was totally worth it!!  Would definitely do it again.."", 'Great views! A little buggy this time of year. Feel the mist coming off the falls!', ""2 stars for the way to go, 4 stars for the way back. We started (Aug 17) at 10.15 in the morning, but we were immediately overwhelmed by the mosquito's and flies. We used a lot of Deet, anti-mosquito spray, but it didn't help. There were so many mosquito's flying in your ears, nose, mouth and eyes that we couldn't ignore them and couldnt enjoy the hike. We have travelled/hiked a lot, but we were never at a place with so many mosquitos. Also all people we met didn't like it because of the mosquitos. After 2 hours we reaches the end of the Mist Trail and stayed for a while at the waterfall, which is very nice! Even at the end of sunner the waterfall was still very powerfull!On the way back we barely saw/heard mosquitos, maybe because of the higher temperature? Now finally we noticed why people love this trail: the nature around you is so beautiful! The part back we really liked, so 4 stars for that. I'd recommend to do the hike not too early because of the mosquitos. It will be warmer if you start later, but we'd prefer that. Tips: take anti-mosquito spray, sunblock and enough water (and some food) with you! And an anti-mosquito net if you decide to leave early :)"", 'Moderate hike. Largely flat road. First mile is exposed and less interesting than the rest of the trail. Nats/mosquitos abound; wear big spray. Popular for day hikers and multi-day backpackers, but if you hit the trail early less people. Recommend hiking just a bit past the bottom of Mist Falls. Good views of the Canyon about half-way up the waterfall (approx. 0.2 mile).', ""Loved this trail! Trail is clear and full of beauty. First mile or so has a lot of fire damage, but nothing impeding the trail and honestly I thought it was cool to see. That being said, don't forget your sunscreen because a good chunk of the trail is exposed without shade. The falls were roaring and the forest was gorgeous and green after you got past the fire scars!"", 'I really enjoyed this hike. The falls were spectacular. We did come across a rattlesnake sunning himself on the trail. He rattled, uncoiled and slithered away. We also came face to face with a bear ... we exchanged pleasantries and went our separate ways. I recommend bug spray,  as the mosquitos were out in full force.', 'I turned a blind corner and ran into a black bear. We glanced at each other and kept walking.  Whew.  Awesome sighting', 'This trail should be rated as easy. Anyone can do this hike. We left around 6:30 and totally beat all the crowds! It was soo serene being on this trail by ourselves. This is a very popular hike. We passed tons of people on our way back. Definitely a hike to do early if you want to beat the crowds', 'Running back down this trail was an absolute blast!', ""7/29/17: gorgeous hike that takes you through forest and then along the river, then some rock scrambling and steps to the the big payoff. The first 1-2 miles are on sand with very little shade, which isn't awesome. But the waterfalls and views at the rock domes before the rocks are worth it. Did this with 2 kids with no problem. The river is very fast moving and angry- have a heathy fear of it and stay away from the banks where it's swift."", 'Great hike and the falls are amazing right now. As others have said, take bug spray! Also, watch your step carefully. We saw two rattlesnakes on the trail.', ""Probably the most beautiful hike I've ever been on. We were only able to do a few things in kings canyon and we were so glad that we did this hike. The hike overall is completely worth it."", 'Amazing hike!!  Definitely need to bring bug spray, but otherwise, the perfect hike.', ""This was quite a challenge for a beginning hiker like myself, but it is doable and the experience was well worth it. The experience offered the feeling of tranquillity as one is enveloped in deep forest for a good portion of the hike. The reward lives up to the name: Mist Falls will definitely greet you. For the more experienced hiker, just a mere two more miles will take you to Paradise Valley, one that I'll hope to experience once my endurance increases."", ""loved this trail. all time fave. if you're visiting kings canyon be sure not to miss out on this one. spectacular views."", 'Great trail, but BRING BUG SPRAY!! Ran into 3 King snakes but they quickly ran away as soon they heard us. Mist Falls is AMAZING.', ""This is a really nice trail in the Sequoia National Park...If you're coming in through hwy 180, continue on towards Grants Grove.  Take this road for the next 32 miles...btw, this is one the best scenic drives I've ever been on.  In fact. the drive alone is worth it.  You'll next arrive at Cedar Grove Village...from this point, you'll come to the end of the road, a round-a-bout.  Park in the first parking lot you see, then sign-in at the rangers station and enjoy your hike."", '7/8/17 - Fantastic hike. Went about a mile past Mist Falls. BRING BUG SPRAY. Several great views of the river and surrounding granite mountains. The trail is muddy in places. The river is still full and flowing fast.', ""Great hike. Fairly easy. Start early as the first half of the trail is exposed. I can't stress enough how much insect repellent you will need on this hike. There are mosquitoes throughout the entire trail. You will be bit if you don't. Ran into a mama bear and her cub and other hikers said they spotted some rattlesnakes. The waterfall is raging and beautiful. Nice view of the river most of the way up."", ""I LOVE THIS TRAIL! I did this hike at the end of May 2017. The snow run off was at its peak so the falls were magnificent! The first part of the trail is flat and sandy. Then you go through a wooded area which was a little muddy due to all the runoff. The river was raging! I stopped halfway through and had lunch near the river. The end of the trail requires a little climb which is why the trail is rated as moderate. I would say the last mile of the trail is the steepest and most energy consuming but I didn't think it was bad. The closer you get to the falls the more mist you feel and it's like a natural air conditioning! Keep your eyes out for snakes. I did see a couple of rattlesnakes in the sandy area but they were doing their best to stay hidden from all the hiker traffic. The views of the mountains on the way up are as breath taking as the falls. Enjoy!"", 'Beautiful hike - starts out in mostly sun but after about 1 mile (that\'s what it felt like) it turns to shade. The trail follows the river very nicely and there is some great white water to check out. A few muddy puddles along the trail but it is easy to go around them. There wasn\'t a clear ""top"" of the falls that we found, so we ended up eating lunch near the Mist area', ""Amazing Trail. Did this on June 24th 2017. Don't forget to check out the neat bridge at the split. 2 miles into the trail, the river's strong overflow this year flooded into the trail, making it inaccessible unless you are willing to get knee deep if not more. I hear that the water level changes throughout the day. Just because you are able to cross does not make you can cross on the way back. Be careful ! Still an amazing hike to see how the flooded river can change the scenery.  I will have to go back next time!"", ""Th first .5 miles was somewhat ordinary but then the trail began to narrow and change to a prettier and intresting scenery. I carried 3 litters of water and a filter but it wasn't needed since the trail was in easy access to the river.  My 9 year old son almost stepped on a king snake barefoot after soaking his feet in the cool water. We took 3 hours to get there but 1 hour to return since we ran back for fun. Mist Falls was truly its name sake, very misty! Please take caution on the slippery rocks- no joke."", ""This trail was awesome! Amazing views all over esp at the top. I'm so glad I read the reviews and I'd like to thank the person who said to bring bug spray! You definitely need it! I was bitten through my pants. The bugs are very aggressive. The first few miles were pretty hot so bring a ton of water and I suggest going in the morning. Make sure to hydrate before and also bring sunscreen!"", 'This trail is incredible! The views of the mountains and the river are glorious.', 'Really get the full effect of Kings Canyon with this hike.', 'mild to moderate difficulty  almost 10 miles round trip hike with outstanding views of the mountains and the white water rivers.  a lot of shade from the pine trees on the trail.  would do it again.', 'Hiked to just above the falls and had some amazing views on the way down. the first 3ish miles are fairly flat before it gets a bit steeper.', 'Great views after you begin the ascent and then back down. I suggest continuing up past the Mist Falls sign (on the log at the bottom of the Falls area) for another half mile or so to get even better views of the falls, the valley, and surrounding peaks.As of early June there are several areas of the trail with ankle high water, and lots of mosquitos along the way.', 'Water was raging, some fun bogs to get through and incredible mountain views', 'My favorite so far. So much water .', 'My favorite so far. So much water .', 'Great trail with the river running high the mist falls earned their name. Trail had a few muddy spots to navigate around but other than that a well maintained trail.', ""It's a great trail, and has beautiful views all the time."", 'By far one of my favorite trails in Cali!! You get a sense of how magnificent the Sierra Range is once you get to the top of the falls. I could stay here for hours just taking everything in!', 'Wonderful hike.  Couple bottles of water, some snacks, and your camera.  Mostly shaded areas, which was a benefit and a lot of good sight of the river as you go along. And yes you may see some wild life.  Me and the guys saw deer, rattle snake, and lizards. Enjoy', 'Great little hike!!!', 'Beautiful! There is also a lot of wildlife. We saw deer, snakes (not rattlesnakes), and a momma bear and her two baby cubs. 5/27/17', 'Awesome water falls！', ""Completed on 5/19/17.  The water level was high, making for a fantastic hike.  You could hear the roar of the stream most of the way up.  \n\nA couple of cautionary notes.\n1. The bugs are everywhere.  Definitely bring bug spray and/or long sleeves and pants.  You may be hot, but I'd rather be a little hot and cool off by splashing stream water on me than being eaten alive by bugs.\n2. Watch out for rattlesnakes.  We saw two sunning themselves on rocks about .5 miles south of the falls in the early afternoon.  Just be aware of your surroundings.\n\nWould highly recommend this trail, especially while snow is still visible along the canyon."", ""Just completed this yesterday. Some of the best views I've ever seen. The hike gets tough around the rocky/sunny areas, but it is worth it. The first two miles are dry, but the hike picks up as you get closer to the water. Just keep going! Near the top (about 7 miles up) the water mellows out near a meadow. The mist feels great on a hot day."", 'Nice view, take bug spray!!', ""Did this hike back in 91'.  I have been here since then,  coming from a Rae Lakes backpack trip also.  Much less water on the latter trip.  There was lots in June of 91' though.  Water roars over this really fast during the spring run off.   The first couple miles is almost flat, then it climbs steady to the falls.  Worth seeing in the spring and early summer."", ""there are a few things you will need on this trail. First, you will most definitely need bug spray with deet in it. the mosquitos in the marshy Forested section of the trail aren't your typical sissy mosquitos. they laugh at lemongrass oil etc. if you do not use deet you will end up with upwards of 20 mosquitos biting you all at once. second, be sure to have sunscreen. the first mile or so of the trail is in direct sunlight. you can burn easily in that time in the California sun. Third, you will want to have plenty of water. my wife and I went through 3 liters each. it can easily get 90+ degrees on the canyon floor in mid summer. lunch isn't a bad idea either to eat by the falls, and don't be afraid to spend a few bucks on a good pair of boots. A blistered set of hooves can ruin your hike as fast as a sprained ankle. also, you will need two days to complete this hike. yes, you may think I'm crazy for saying that, but go ahead and try to make it to the bottom of the canyon without stopping your vehicle umpteen times to stare at the spectacle before you and to take pictures. it's nearly impossible!the hike itself is beautiful. I cannot fathom how any of the other comments can say anything negative about it. you have to remember that all forks of the Kings river are fed by snowmelt. so, if you hike later in the year, say September, the river levels are way down and are nothing compared to the awe inspiring and spectacular torrent of power you will see in May and early June. so naturally, mist falls will also be very lackluster well. The hike is not hard but it is also not easy. for the most part the footing is solid and the trail well worn into the soil. there are a few Rocky and uneven places, though. no matter, being able to stare up at the canyon walls high above you and being able to follow and listen to the river near you makes up for any hardship. a little over halfway through you come to a large exposed rock that you can stand on and look back down canyon. the views of the Sphinx rock formation and the canyon from there are some of the tastiest that my eyes have ever had the pleasure of feasting on. simply beautiful. the words of man simply cannot explain the wondrous sight. surely, somewhere, the heavens have a text that more accurately describes it. I simply find that standing and gazing in awe and after respect for nature was about the best I could manage to do for several moments. the falls are not super tall but the sheer amount of water coming over them creates quite a misty breeze that will get you soaking wet in very little time at all! bring a dry bag for your camera or if you a choice, bring a waterproof camera. taking a short stroll above the falls let's you get a while different perspective. just above you get a pretty close up view of a few waterwheels as the massive amount of spring runoff sheets across the granite slab. quite an awesome sight! also, beware of rattlesnakes. remember, they will not hurt you if you leave them alone. we encountered two on the trail and one actually ran scared. it barely even ticked its rattle. the other was nowhere near cover so it got defensive but did not pose a threat in any way to anyone. it simply coiled and rattled away. I also managed to catch a beautiful Sierra mountain kingsnake! I felt privileged to have the opportunity to catch one as it was the first one I've seen in the wild. it was grumpy and bit me but remember, they are non-venomous and there are no coral snakes in the Sierras to confuse them with. if you are afraid of any snakes, just remember to leave them alone and they will leave you alone. this hike is well worth any hardship it may pose to you. no mere words or photographs can accurately describe the raw beauty and power you will encounter in Kings canyon NP. I recommend this hike, go and see for yourself!"", 'Absolutely amazing!', ""This was an excellent hike. It was a little longer than I'm used to, but the beginning is super flat and easy. Most of the gain is towards the end, but it gets shadier as you go along and there are plenty of great views along the way that make you want to keep going. There are plenty of photo ops that I took advantage of and I even got some pictures of some black-tailed deer on the way back.I highly recommend this hike! I only wish I had brought lunch with me as well as some bug spray."", 'Hate to say it but this was my least favorite hike we did in the Sierra Nevada\'s, Besides been ""Eaten Alive"" ( & Yes we did have spray on, It didn\'t seem to matter) Views were nothing spectacular, Neither was the waterfall. Granted we did just come from Yosemite, so maybe we were spoiled. Just found the whole hike disappointing, was expecting much more with the good rating it received, Maybe the trail gets better above the falls. but if that\'s as far as your going, you might wanna look for something else to do. Roaring River Falls was a better falls', 'Great hike with lots of entertainment.  The drive in is beautiful.  The hike is just long enough to feel like you got a good workout without being totally exhausted.  The falls are beautiful and the mist is refreshing.  We have usually seen some sort of wildlife in the trail...momma bear with cubs, snakes .... pay attention to both sides of the trail and the rocks on the trail.  Last time I saw a baby snake swimming from shore to a rock near the falls.  AND yes as other posters have said - bring bug spray!', ""Did this hike yesterday, it was fantastic! Definitely got a good workout in and the views were stunning. We didn't start the hike until 12:30 which I don't necessarily recommend because the first couple miles are in mostly direct sunlight. Once we got into the forest it cooled off but BEWARE-BRING BUG SPRAY. I did not have any bug spray on and I got about 50 bites on my arms and face, it was terrible. There were points where I felt like I was being swarmed. We took a cat nap just below mist falls on the rocks near the river and some water falls. Totally peaceful. My favorite part of this hike was looking back at the view from the top of the switchbacks. So beautiful! I definitely recommend this hike to everyone. On the way back down just before the split in the trail, I ran into a small black bear. Other than my heart racing, it was completely fine, I climbed down onto some rocks and let the bear climb up the hill and out of range. I also saw a few mellow deer. This hike would be great for wildlife and bird watchers. Next time I am bringing my fishing pole as we saw lots of brown trout in the river."", 'What a fun hike…the trail basically starts at the furthest point of Roads End.  Towering granite peaks funnel you into a dense forest where you wind back and forth along the South Fork Kings River.  After about two miles into the hike there is a split in the trail…off to the right and over the bridge you will meet up with Kanawyer Loop amongst other trails…I stayed left and headed up towards Mist Falls.  The trail is mostly level so I move pretty quick till the last mile or so where I begin to climb up out of the trees and onto a giant granite slab…make sure you take a moment and look behind you at the canyon walls that surround you.  Before climbing back into the woods I took a quick peek at the river which was moving pretty good downhill through a narrow channel of rocks.  From this point it didn’t take long to reach Mist Falls.  There is a great open area at the base of the falls to take pictures and to just chill if you don’t mind getting soaked.  On most days I could have turned around and headed back content for having experienced so many fantastic sites but with Paradise Valley just a couple miles away I started climbing.  This part of the hike was a bit more challenging having to climb some stone steps and weave through series of switchbacks.  After the trail leveled out I was rewarded with some amazing views and some clear green waters.  After throwing down some lunch and a tasty beverage I headed down the hill.  At the split I decided to take Kanawyers trail to mix things up.  Probably not my most favorite part of the hike but any new trail is an adventure.  I started this hike looking forward to visiting Mist Falls but what I wasn’t prepared for was how much I would enjoy the many other sites and experiences this hike offers.', 'A beautiful hike.  Start early there are parts are not shaded.  Bring lots of water and bring a good bug spray we were eaten alive by mosquitoes and we were wearing bug spray but still a great hike.', ""This hike is fantastic! It's pretty easy on the feet and plenty of areas to rest between the elevation increases. Can easily be done as a day home or the beginning of a backpacking trip. Watch out for slippery rocks, silent rattle snakes and plenty of bears."", 'One of my favorite hikes while in Cedar Grove. Definitely have to watch for rattlesnakes. Start early because it does get extremely hot in the afternoon!', 'Beautiful hike and views.  Very nice trail and easy to follow.  We saw a mama black bear with her cub and deer.  My husband and I hiked this trail April 30, 2016.  There was a lot of water in the Kings River.  Loved the hike.', 'Hiked early this past June as part of a larger loop connecting to the JMT, then down Copper Creek back to Roads End. Gorgeous waterfall which was flowing very well. The trail was in great condition and I would say of moderate difficulty (with multi-night packs). If you continue on to camp at Paradise Valley, makes for a great little two day or weekend out-and-back.', 'Would do this again in a heartbeat. Absolutely gorgeous.', 'I did this hike when I was about 12 and I LOVED it! I definitely plan on doing it again next time I go! The falls at the end of the hike are worth it!', 'I did this hike with my 11 year old daughter, we backpacked and camped in paradise valley. It was great for her first. Lots of deer, fish, and Mosquitos. I would recommend taking the time for this hike', ""I've done this trail as a day hike, and a backpack. backpacking at paradise valley is unbelievable! we woke up and there were deer walking all around our campsite without a care in the world. would highly recommend taking the day to do this trail."", ""Went on this hike with five other people and we all agreed - one of the best hikes we've ever done! Not too challenging, spectacular all around, river and waterfalls and forests - all around just exciting and spectacular. A great way to see all of the canyon (not to mention you need to drive all the way in to get there so you get a fantastic drive too) and it's not too busy so we saw wildlife and not too many crowds. I've been told that if you go farther down the trail it continues to be spectacular, too, with even less people."", 'Terrains and views change constantly, giving you the different beauties of the park.  its an amazing trail.', 'I went here during my first trip to Kings Canyon and the Sequoias. This was the coolest hike i have ever been on! The actual falls are beautiful and were tucked away in the back, but very easy to get to. You are near water during most of the hike and have plenty of opportunities to get wet. On the trail we came across a few deer (one was right on the trail and casually stepped out of the way so we could pass), as well as a mother Brown Bear with two cubs.  Check out the video i made!', 'Great hike for early season when the water volume is high, air is cool and not too many people are out yet.  Easy, flat trail until Bubbs Creek junction at 1.9 miles, then moderately uphill.  Camp at Lower Paradise Valley.', ""Beautiful hike. Wonderful landscape. It's pretty dense and mostly covered by the huge Sequoias. After about 3 miles or so, it starts to get pretty steep for about two miles. It's not too strenuous but be careful if you're not used to hiking in the mountains, mainly because of the elevation. At a few points you're walking next to the river, which is beautiful and the huge Waterfall is breath taking. Get out early and complete the whole trail before it gets dark.  "", 'Great easy to moderate hike, depending on how hard you feel like hoofing up and down the trail. The first two miles are fairly flat, with a hop-skip-and a jump over a couple of streams depending on the time of year. It had to have been an anomaly, but it snowed pretty heavily the day before Memorial day, along with all the mist from the falls, made for a pretty wet and cold hike towards the end......but well worth it. The falls were booming!', 'A beautiful hike, The trail meanders along a river and takes your right past several large waterfalls. While Mist Falls its self is kinda tucked away giving the impression of seclusion. This trail also offers several oppertunities for trail blazing and exploring. There was one area where a hugh tree had fallen allowing us to ford the river and check out a small center island. Just the thing for the adventerious spirit. \n\nThe trail leaves something to be desired as there are parts where your not really sure where you are going. Mist Falls its self can only be accessed by what, for lack of better term, seems to be a creek bed or run off, and there is another large falls right before that where the trail seems to ""end"". So that can be kinda deceptive. But if you go up the runoff area and about a quarter of a mile further you\'ll come to Mist Falls, and believe me its worth it!! :-)', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '',

underground cabins.  the trail is super easy. the areas with the trail with the cabins looks like something you would see out of a movie. it was a small trickle of a waterfall. technically not even a waterfall. it's like only a run of water down the side of the rockwall. prepare yourself for that hill back up. you will def be huffing and puffing.."", 'The hike down and up were wonderful! Less trafficked compared to Sturtevant Falls. The one draw back was the amount of gravity found in the area.... Heavily graffitied especially at the boulders where the water falls!', 'Disappointing amount of graffiti at Hermit Falls. Well trafficked trail. Nice once you get off pavement. Can take the leg off to sturtevant falls loop back on the paved trail to add another 2.5 miles or so.', 'Virtual Hike: https://youtu.be/Ufi15b3pKlI\n\nWhat a fun and short hike!  I arrived to Chantry Flats around 3PM, and there was plenty of parking available.  (The drive up to Chantry Flats is quite enjoyable as well.  The trail starts just down the stairs from the restroom.  The trail at first is a paved road, but after less than 1/8 mile there is a sign that leads onto a real trail.  You can’t miss it.  The trail switches back and forth to the bottom of the canyon, where there are a few cabins, follow the trail down the canyon past more cabins and continue up a trail along the right side of the canyon.  Within a few minutes you will reach a bunch of large boulders cut by the water.  This time of year there isn’t as much water, but I was surprised to see as much as I did.  There is an easy area of the falls to get to and hang out, but to see the main waterfall, you must climb down a set of rocks.  Don’t worry, there are ropes with loops to make this easier.  Once down to the waterfall, there is a nice pool of water that you can take a dip in.  I was taken aback by how much graffiti and left over beer cans there are down there.  Still enjoyable nonetheless.  I saw a handful of people at the falls, just hanging out, and made some friends!  Once done chillin’ at the falls, there is a significant climb back up the trail to Chantry Flats.  Make sure you don’t waste all your energy at the falls because you’ll need it for the ascent.  700 feet in 1.5 miles ain’t a joke, but certainly a great workout, that on the last heatwave of the summer months leading into fall will have you sweating in no time!\n\nAll in all a wonderful hike and a great way to spend an afternoon!\n\nHope you enjoy!\n\nPlaylist for the trail: https://tinyurl.com/y9appm2e', 'Went hiking here on a Thursday morning so parking was Not a issue. after the short walk to the trailhead we walk on a dusty path until we got deeper into the forest then you see how green and pretty it is. the water flow is  a trickle, but I\'ve been here before after the rain and it was flowing and beautiful. Right now  it is like ""hard mud"" the insects are buzzing  around the mud and water, you might want to bring bug repellant. I think I swallowed a bug ha ha. it\'s a easy hike to the falls, please be careful the rocks are huge and smooth. I have very good hiking boots and theres no grip, so slipping is possible and the  water is low. I know this is a ""cliff jumping"" spot but looking at the low water and seeing the rocks I can\'t believe people jump off this. i think if they saw what\'s down there when the water is low they would think twice. So easy, good hike. Wish there wasn\'t so much trash and graffiti but you can still see the beauty in nature. #mountaingirl', 'very nice trail. lots of shade, water was very dirty bcus of no water flow. other than that very peaceful trail', 'Short hike down on steep, cliff hugging trail but plenty of shade. Great for year-round hiking and especially in the spring time. Check out the diving pools near the end!', 'Nice place! Really recommend it', 'The hike is fairly easy and short but get there early because it shares a parking lot with a bunch of other hikes (including Mt. Wilson) and it will be full by 7am. The falls themselves aren’t really that special and they get crowded  I didn’t really care for all the graffiti. Kids will be cliff jumping, which I don’t recommend. Not my favorite waterfall hike in the area but if you’re into jumping off of cliffs, it’s an option.', '6-10 hike for', ""The trail down to the waterfall is nice. Went on a weekday and there were a good amount of people just hanging out near the falls. I don't know how people cliff dive here, looks terrifying! To get down to the pool is pretty hard although there is a rope provided. The fall in itself is nice aside from all the tagging ):"", 'It was beautiful, except the graffiti. Waterfalls were amazing.', 'Great trail!', ""Fun to get to! Has a tricky ladder at the end that you have to go down. The forest that you go through is beautiful. I just didn't like the graffiti tags on the rocks and not much to really see at the end. But in the end I would hike it again for sure."", 'nice place .', ""the trail is a lot of fun and Lush scenery unfortunately taggers got in there and ruined some of the beauty of the scenery still worth the trip but the last 50 or 75 yards to hermit Falls is very difficult and we didn't attempt it"", 'Nice easy hike down to riverbed then along it to the pools.  Id call it hermit pools.  Saw cliff jumping into the pools while there.  Amaaazing lushness around the river.  3 stream crossings.', 'Very sad to say this place has been ruined over the past 10 years or so by an influx of graffiti, trash and degradative gang culture using it as a hangout to drink and play loud (terrible) music. What a shame.', 'I’ve been here back in 2012 and again recently and it looked so different I almost didn’t recognize it. There was sooo much graffiti and trash! Very crowded with lots of young adults playing their loud music and drinking beers and trashing the place. I cliff jumped into the water last time but not this time around, too many rude people and it made me feel uncomfortable. If you do decide to do this hike, please bring a bag with you to pick up trash.

Once there, you cross the stream and head to the right.  There is a trail that heads left, but it joins up with the Sturtevent Falls trail.  The rest of the way is pretty flat to the falls.\n\nHermit Falls itself was quite pretty and a unique sight to see.  There were some teenagers jumping off the cliff into the water pool below.  Judging from the screams, I am assuming the water was as cold as it appeared in early February.\n\nThe biggest disappointment of the hike was the trash and graffiti.  It really was a little heartbreaking to see the trail and falls so abused.\n\nThe way back was pretty easy.  The first incline right after First Water is the worst of it, but it is steady for awhile.

If your looking for that breath taking , escape from LA , bond with nature experience , I highly recommend this trail. It's at it's must stunning beauty right after a long rain storm, when everything is lush, green, clean and the falls are flowing.

There are cool cabins that line the first part of the hike downstream, some are occasionally occupied, some are damaged.  There are a few man-made dams up and down the stream. There are two pools to jump into at the end of the hike. The first had various heights to jump from  and was plenty deep. You can also slide down the natural rock-water slide into this pool as well. The lower falls is much bigger and much shallower. You were pretty much guaranteed to touch the bottom if you jumped from the top. There is a rope to assist you on the climb back up to the top of the falls. There was some graffiti and trash, but it was obvious that they tend to the trail pretty well.  The hike up can be tough once you escape the shade of the trees. All uphill on the way back.', ""this was an easy trail/hike.  can't believe there's graffiti on the rocks!  not good. "", 'Easy hike combined with other trail en route.  Too crowded.  Will return to do early morning.', '#1 Rule: Arrive EARLY, mostly for parking. By 7:30am parking lot is full and will have to park down the mountain road. \n\nTIPS: Bring lots of water, sunscreen, bugspray and PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, pick up after yourself!\n\n*2nd time going to Hermit Falls. I love it. The trail zig zags for the first 1/2 mile and is mostly open, the trail is pretty narrow (one person) so tread carefully.  After that is all forestry and full shade. Beautiful scenery.  Once you arrive to the falls, there are 3 pools. Many people jump from the cliffs into the pools which is a lot of fun! However, the rocks are very slippery so be careful. Water is clean but will get clogged due to litter or debris. I usually remove as much debris/litter as possible to help the stream flow smoothly and clear out the water pools.\n\nDownfalls: The amount of grafitti on the rocks and litter of beer cans is just..... upsetting and disturbing.', 'This is a moderate hike, At points it can feel steep, This place has too many Liters, people Please take ur trash with you :P\nAlso if your gonna jump into the water hole make sure the water is about 8 feet you can get hurt if the water is shallow.. ', ""I enjoyed the trail and jumping from the waterfall was the most exciting! Yes there is graffiti which ruins the scenery but we can't do much about that... however we can do something about the trash! Let's keep the place clean by cleaning up after ourselves :D "", 'first of all have your adventure parking pass before hand . second get there early by 8 am because parking becomes almost impossible by 10 am. as far as the trail I enjoyed it very much. The trail is mainly down hill so expect to walk back up on the return . the scenery was nice with brushy sunny switch backs and shaded walks through the creek. The falls were very popular with many jumping into the pools .  jumps of heights of 12, 25, and 55 feet.  ', ""You MUST get there EXTREMELY early to find good parking. My group got there around 1030-11 in the morning and parking was HORRENDOUS. You need to have an adventure pass ($5/day) or if you have an annual pass you're good. The hike is a lot of fun! We had a group of 5 people including myself and I took my miniature Dachshund who weighs 17 lbs. and is 4 1/2 years old. It was about 80 degrees or so when we went. It was a Saturday (hence the reason why the parking was out of control). My Dachshund did extremely well on this hike. There are two small creek crossings which she did fine with. It's a heavily used trail and we did see one rattlesnake so if you are hiking in the summertime please be careful! The cliff jumps are pretty awesome. 4 of our group members did the higher one. I didn't do it because I was way too chicken and I had to watch my dog. There is quite a bit of trash near the falls and graffiti, but it is still an amazing place to see in my opinion. We all loved it and hope to return someday again. My main take home points would be 1) Get parking EARLY!!! 2) Beware of wilderness when you are hiking. Perhaps even bring emergency kits just in case. 3) It is a heavily used trail so please don't bring any dogs that may not get along with other people, kids, or dogs."", 'I gave this trail three stars because there was a lot of trash around the waterfall and there was quite a bit of graffiti on the rocks too.  We went on a Friday and arrived at 8am, parking was almost full at the Chantry Flat parking lot (you need an Adventure Pass to park here).  We headed down a steep paved road from the lot.  There are several signs along the way pointing you towards the different trails.  We chose to take the trail for Hermit Falls because it got us off the paved road and because it looked like it had a lot of greenery.  The dirt trail is well maintained, although it gets narrow in some areas.  A couple of times we had to cross the stream stepping on the rocks.  My friend brought her small dog and she had to carry the dog across the stream, but it is doable.  When you reach the waterfall it is surrounded by huge boulders.  The waterfall is nothing spectacular, but the view around is quite beautiful and relaxing.  Actually the best part of the trail was the scenery along the way.  The forest was breathtaking.  Coming back up the sun had come out and it was getting very hot!  So the steep hills took more effort to hike up (sunscreen and hats are helpful).  The steep uphill paved road back up to the parking lot was tough, but considering how beautiful the entire hike was overall, I think it was well worth it.  We plan to go back and explore other trails without the dog which should make it easier.  I would recommend this hike mostly for the beauty of the trail.', ""The water is dirty and there's way too much trash.  I don't understand how so many people can just throw there water bottles and plastic bags out into the river or into the forest.  Usually when I see trash out hiking I'll pick it up but on this trail there's just way too much its disgusting.  Instead of going out and enjoying nature you're stuck contemplating how terrible human beings can be to our planet.  I guess it should be expected being this close to LA, but seriously tits the dirties trail I've ever been on.  "", ""Lovely hike. You go down down down first, which can be a little bit of a pain when you're on the way back up and tired out. When you get to the creek make sure you go to the right and follow the trail to the falls (you'll see a sign next to the creek a little later after turning right). As others said, lots of trash, so I brought a bag and picked some of it up to toss when I got back to the lot. :-)"", ""Beautiful... Amazing greenery 3/4 of the trail is completely shaded with a great breeze. Good anytime hike. After the rains is ideal due to the water levels. My 3 & 12 year old enjoy jumping off the cliffs into the refreshing water. The trail is not congested with hikers so it's serene & enjoyable.  By far my favorite "", ""Low life city, the falls are great but the trash should be thorn-out  with the bottles and cans. I'm glad that at least i,m not going home with thees losers !

Hiked on a sunday and were able to park on the street without a problem.', ""The counter clockwise route is a more scenic way to start the hike and it's the route I picked. There is a good amount of incline throughout the hike, but during the first half it seems to be broken up nicely. I didn't start to get tired until we started the incline at the falls loop. The falls incline got a little annoying, probably because I expected there to be very little left and there was still a bit left until you got midway in the falls loop. The trail also gets tighter on the falls loop and sections get steeper without much grip under your feet. A walking stick would be helpful on the waterfall loop, but if you aren't too clumsy and have decent shoes you will be okay without one, although I wished I had mine for that section. There were lots of cool wildflowers and the sound of the falls were nice probably because  we went late April. It was a pleasant hike just go prepared. If you are out of shape I could imagine this is a hard hike. If you are somewhat active this is definitely a moderate/hard hike depending on the weather. You don't want to do this hike on a warm day in the afternoon. The waterfalls are nice, but dont expect anything spectacular. It's just nice to hear the sound of water and see the surrounding greenery."", 'This hike was nicer but not what a hike should be like. First 2 miles were on a dirt service road. It was pleasant to walk but not much to see the first 2 miles. ONce you get into the single track that the hike became more like a “Nature” hike. There were several nice waterfalls but nothing over 5  feet drop. The water is refreshingly cool to dip your hat in and to cool your feet. The last aspect of the hike was on a ridge coming back. The view was nice but after 15 minutes the view is the same. Definitely a hike to do in the spring or after rainfall due to the highlight of seeing little veils or waterfalls. The running streams was great to see and hear as well. Bring lots of water if you go in the summer since it gets hot in Clayton, CA. There are nice rest spots along the streams to eat lunch or snack.

We went counterclockwise which was a very moderate trail.  With some trekking poles, it was a great hike for beginners to feel and break into our gear.  The elevation was steep so the poles were great help.  Without the heavy backpack, this hike would probably be good with just some good trail shoes with traction.   The waterfalls were dinky so don’t expect too much.   The view of the valley was gorgeous.  We went a little later in the day around 4pm and got back at 8 which sufficient light after the sunset.  Watch out for poison ivy and I’ve heard there are rattlesnakes.', 'It took a bit to find the trails that actually lead you to the waterfalls, you have to look for the signs that take you the falls trail.

I did feel there were some hard areas but as beginners we were able to get through it and we will be going back!', 'Tougher than anticipated.', 'Beautiful route lined with wild daffodils in January. My suggestion is to bring two liters of water, some trail mix and burrito. Then hike the route counter clockwise as to reach the waterfalls slightly over two hours.

There were a handful of people on the Falls Trail, so we were basically alone and could hear the waterfalls, creeks, and birds along the way.

Some parts are very rocky and narrow (some areas you can barely stand with both feet together) with sheer drops to the side, but they both did fine and said it was the best hike of their lives and I can't disagree, the rocky terrain was stunning. At the falls you have to jump or rock hop across, there's one where you just have to walk through as with all the rain it's too wide to jump and no rocks to hop on. We did the loop clockwise. The trail map provided on this app was helpful as there are many forks in the trail throughout the entire loop and the GPS dot on the app was very accurate (even with no signal at times it worked just fine). Gorgeous, fun (VERY muddy in the beginning, sunk to my ankles) hike and will def do again."", 'Really beautiful hike!!! I wish there were more clear signs on where the waterfalls are located.

After walking four miles out on the path I realized I was being stalked by one. It was not until the last half mile that I made eye contact with the 200 + pound beast and luckily ran into a family of four when I started running. I will never do this trail again."", ""Whew! I'm new to hiking and this trail was a doosy for me at some parts but the view was totally worth it. Once we got into the heart of the Cabinet Oaks Road, the incline got pretty serious and the sweating began! The trails were easy to follow but once on Falls Trail, it gets very narrow! Between POI #5 and POI#6, the trail is hard to distinguish and we were momentarily lost but picked it up thanks to my trusty GPS and the Everytrail App. The Waterfalls themselves were a little underwhelming since we haven't had a lot of rain but the view of the Clayton Valley was spectacular. The rest of the trail was great once down the hill, shaded and a slow steep. We cut back over to the Cabinet Oaks Road via the Fire Road and did not hike the Back Creek Trail, my group and I were worn out so we called it quits but it was a great route and a great workout!"",

If you decide to take the challenge I would suggest going counter clock wise and avoid the annoying crowds congregating at the falls area, you won’t see them until near the end. Most of the trail is downhill this way, and way more enjoyable. Once you make the falls area, sit and rest and enjoy the scenery .... it’s a nice payoff. I’d recommend hiking shoes, with good grip and comfortable insoles .... your feet are going to thank you!', 'did the loop once last spring it is more like 12 miles the fall are alot better after a heavy rain', 'I did this trail but started at alpine lake took the trail counter clockwise, the trail up winds in and out of large beautiful trees and many creek crossings, and waterfalls. nice wooden bridges to keep you from getting wet even during rainy seasons. Once you get to the top, the trail loses its beauty and other hikers disappears going down. There is a creek crossing just past the lake that you might run into trouble during rains there is no bridge.', 'One of the best hikes I’ve done in Mt Tam. You will go though many different types of forest and nature. The lake is really beautiful about halfway through. We took a couple of detours and made it closer to a 12 mike hike in about 4 hours. Highly recommend.', 'Did counterclockwise. Highlight is the alpine lake. Pristine and not even a single soul nearby as I hiked this in the evening. I had a constant fear of mountain lion as there is a sign which said ""avoid hiking alone"". Nevertheless, found lot of people near cataract falls. Moderate hike.', 'Great trail, long but not too hard for us, we went anti-clockwise.There is not too much water at the fall but the lake is nice to have a meal break. There are several restrooms at picnic area along on the trail. We started at 9 am and completed at 1:30 pm. Dog, Cat, Crocodile friendly, not so much bugs or mosquitoes. Go early and park your car under big tree. I am kidding about the crocodile anyway.', ""Using this exact route we chose to go East first.\n\nStarting at 9am on a Saturday, we saw only about 12 people in total until about the 6 mile mark.\n\nThe trail is beautiful but not in a scenic vista way.  You will constantly have shade and a limited view of the path before and behind you as it is well grown bushes and trees as well as numerous turns.\n\nWe didn't see much wildlife but the manzanitas are amazing as well as the redwoods here and there.\n\nThe lake is a nice serene spot to have a small break.  No bugs or mosquitoes.\n\nThe path is well marked but bring your map on the app as it did help.  Also, it is well maintained but there is a lot of erosion which means you will need to concentrate on your steps for most of the entire hike...so a lot of engagement with the path.\n\nIf you do this exact hike, if you are just in average shape, it will be hard.  If less than average shape, it will be strenuous.  If in good shape it will be a good long exhausting hike."", 'Beautiful hike, waterfalls, lush ferns to manzanita, views of the lake.

Took our time and explored each waterfall. Ended up being 12.2 miles only because we kept exploring. Great hike!', '', 'great hike today, still some water flow in the falls, my Fitbit said 10.5 miles. went clockwise parking at Rock Spring. trailhead starting with the Cataract trail, lunch break at Alpine Lake which was a nice unexpected surprise to see on this hike. Nice and cool in the trees even though we worked up a sweat on the Kent trail!', 'Took this hike yesterday and although we hoped for warm, it was quite foggy and cool. Don’t be scared off by the Rock Springs parking lot - we thought the trail would be packed. True the downward hike was busy but once we turned off at alpine lake and came back up - and I do mean up- the Kent trail we ran into only a few folks. The wildflowers, especially iris, were out in full force, Got to see a little newt and a frog! Great variety of flora and geology - a most highly recommended hike! From a 57 year old and 23 year old daughter!', 'Awesome trail. Lots of elevation changes and things to see. Def a work out.', 'Very beautiful hike.  Did the loop to the lake and back to the cataract falls.  Is a 9.2 miles, took us about 6 hours, stopping for lunch, pictures and just enjoying the beautiful view.', ""Arrived at the trail head at 7:30am the place was empty.  It took us five hours, my Fitbit said it was 10.2 miles.  it probably took an extra hour or so because i was doing some photography.  Anyway it is longer than eight miles.  We only passed a couple people along the way, it was Awesome.  We seen a Pilated Woodpecker. Got back to the waterfalls portion of the loop around 1pm and it was a zoo.  People drinking, playing music, it was crowded. had to wait in line to get down some portions, Just get there early, it's worth it.!  Amazing hike, one of the bay areas best."", 'Amazing waterfalls and pools all along the cataract falls trail', 'Awesome trail. Great scenery. Dogs allowed. So many little streams and great waterfalls. Looking forward to doing it again.', 'Parked at Rock Springs.  Hiked counterclockwise - down Simmons-Bernstein-Kent to Alpine Lake then back up on Helen Market-Cataract Falls.  Good water flow after the recent rains.  Hiked: 8.4 miles, 4 hours.', 'Yep we did it in the pouring rain & it was still spectacular!  The falls were fanastic & all the trails were streams.  Its going to be amazing for the next few days while all the water rushes down.  Beautiful scenery & habitats & plenty of newts hiking with us.', 'One of the most gorgeous hikes in the Bay Area. The water is really flowing right now! Also, climb up the hill across from the parking lot for a truly epic view of the Bay Area.', 'Went here on Sunday 03/11 with my husband. Hike ended up being closer to 9 miles, but was very enjoyable! I could see it starting to get busier near the falls around 130-2pm but still a very nice hike. Trail is well maintained, and mostly shady.', 'So we started our hike going to Cataract Falls, on a weekday. We didn’t see too many people, and by the time we got there the hike wasn’t too difficult. Lots of going downstairs. We kept pushing to go to the lake, and made it. But that’s when the trail became difficult! And we had already hiked 5 miles at this point and it was close to 2:30. We had to summon all our strength to push up hill the last half of the hike, which beame the hard part! At the end, my fit bit said we did over 10 miles! It was worth it and a great accomplishment, but frustrating that the site said 7.5 miles.', ""This is a great hike. We went after the rainy season and the falls were fairly big.  I will come back here again. We did it in February, it gets chilly. A softshell or a light jacket should be enough to keep you warm. Lots of people, you won't be alone on this trail."", 'Absolutely gorgeous trail. Def go right at the start like other people say. However I got done at 8.5 miles not the 7 miles it says but also not the 12 plus miles other people are claiming. I also got 1900ft elevation climb whereas others seem to be different. Weird. If you go right you hit the meadow first then the alpine and then you hit a stunning stream and bridge before you hit the falls. Before the falls I only met one person along the trail. After the falls I met a lot of people. Highly recommended but get there early to avoid the crowds.', ""One thing to note, the distance reported on Alltrails is off. Here's my GPS recording on Strava which comes to around 10miles ( I went off trail for about 0.5 miles ) https://www.strava.com/activities/1401541303 \n\nLovely hike. Butt burner of a hike :-). Definitely good training if you'r planning for the likes of Half Dome. Shaded, so good for a hot sunny day, stays cool for most part of the hike. Medium to heavy traffic. Half way mark is at the Alpine Lake which is a super quiet area, great for a break/lunch spot. Although the Cataract Falls itself is even more beautiful and serene so you might want to have your snack/lunch there instead."", 'I ended up only doing Cataract Trail because I got a late start.  I made a huge mistake parking at the Rock Spring parking lot instead of the Watershed parking lot.  The majority of this trail is on a steep incline, so I ended up starting downhill and ending uphill.  It was strenuous but beautiful.  I had the trail to myself most of the way out which was really nice.  I loved this trail!', ""Hiked 13.1 mi. Gained 2480ft in elevation.\n\nBEAUTIFUL trails! We went in thinking it was a 7.5 mi 1745ft gain hike but really it's 13 miles with 2480 gain in elevation... I wish this could be edited because we were in for quite a long hike.\n\nPack lunch and plenty of water! We took this trail in reverse, counter-clockwise. We had lunch at Alpine Lake which took us 1.5 to 2 hours to reach at a steady pace. Most of the way there was downhill so be sure to side-step to save your toes! After the lake we headed to the waterfalls which was all on an uphill incline, and then the trail back to our car was on a heavy incline as well (lots of stairs) with the last leg (about 0.9mi) being a flat meadow. Be prepared to work!\n\nEven though we hiked 5 miles more and gained 700ft more than this says in elevation it was well worth the work! Our feet and legs were doggone dead LOL but it was so freakin gorgeous out! We saw lots of butterflies, different birds, and salamanders on a warm Feb day!"", 'Hiked 13.2 milesGained 2142 ft elevationFeatured: Waterfall(s), meadow(s), vista(s)Trail: Well maintained in most areas, legible trail markers (albeit confusing at times) most areas have no signal (pay attention to alltrails map) free parking (ticketed after sunset and locked in), the actual trail is 7.3 miles (begin on the right trail because you will head down hill and end your hike on even ground rather than reverse) relatively isolated in back areas. A beautiful place to star gaze and climb trees. Moderate/hard. (we took every wrong way possible.  lol)', 'Lovely place after a rainy day!', 'Good moderate uphill or downhill the wholetime.', 'note the directions that are given, the road was closed to where the trail head started so you ha e to park across from that road and walk about 1.5 uphill or so up the road. then you hit the trail. which is great if you make sure you have plenty of time. we started around 1:30, thinking 3.5 hours as the other hikers said would be fine. well we had to turn around at 5.1 miles in (that includes the road hike to the trail head)so that we would make it out of there by dark . we busted ass back up the stairs we thought we would never have to walk up after walking down them. just make sure to give yourself plenty of time!!', 'Beautiful hike with lots of different terrain - woods, meadows, and some rocky peaks.  Took around 3.5 hours to complete. Majority downhill on the way to Alpine lake (we took the right side of the loop to the lake), and it’s a real butt buster on the way home past Cataract Falls, but beautiful the whole time and almost empty (except for actually at the falls). Definitely will go back!', 'Excellent hike if you are seeking solitude.  I covered over half the trail distance before I passed another hiker.  The trail is densely wooded with oak and redwood to the point where you are covered in shade for most of the hike.  The trail is very narrow and often covered with leaves and pine needles so a map or the AllTrails app is essential to staying for staying on course.  Cataract Falls are ruggedly beautiful with a soothing sound that will put you at peace.  As a bonus point, the vistas along the road leading up to the trailhead are the most breathtaking views of the SF Bay I have ever seen.  Overall a must experience.', ""Up or down the entire time but shaded too. One of the best hikes we've done."", '', 'I hiked three times there in this spring. I definitely will go back next spring when water is plenty', 'It’s got everything, all together...few miles up a misty waterfall and bam! You’re in a sunny meadow, and then bam! You’re at a deep blue lake. Bam! The ocean. Bam! The redwoods. It’s a Mt. Tam sampler platter, can’t go wrong.', 'Awesome, beautiful but can be crowded, especially the Catarack Falls portion...  Best to do in the spring.', ""Really good, solid hike! Has all sorts of terrain and almost everything you can ask for in a hike, including the lake and waterfalls. The water level wasn't ideal at the falls, but it was still worth it. Has lots of shade throughout the hike. I would definitely recommend and do it again!"", 'Great trail. Some challenging parts due to the climb and rocky terrain. Got lost a couple of times and added 30 mins to the hike because we went down Cataract Trail to the Alpine Lake parking lot instead of Helen Market Trail. A couple of confusing junctions at Laurel Dake and at Simmons Trail junctions. Not too bad and probably seemed worse because we were hurting! Would love to do this hike when the waterfalls are really flowing!', ""An absolutely lovely hike near Mt. Tamalpais.  Groves of manzanita, spruce, and redwoods, a lake, waterfalls, and beautiful trail...so much to love about this hike.  As others have said, this hike is like walking into a fairytale. In addition, you get to hike on a variety of terrain: dirt, stairs, rocks, and bridges.\n\nLong story short: Do this hike, especially if you've already hiked to Mt. Tam peak and are looking for something different.\n\nThe trail is moderate hard in difficulty.  My tracker recorded 8.1 miles with 1818 feet elevation gain.  It is mostly shaded, which makes it easier.  There are several changes in elevation, so your legs will get a good healthy workout.  Overall, a good hike for someone comfortable with moderate trails looking to ramp it up a bit, while under cover of shade. \n\nWe completed the loop counterclockwise beginning at the Rock Springs trailhead.  The Kent Trail on the eastern side of the loop is challenging with several changes in elevation - we went pretty slow on some of the steep downhill sections.  We saw very few people on the Benstein/Kent trail, so it was very peaceful.  You could hear nothing but wind in the trees and the occasional woodpecker. We picnicked by Lake Alpine and saw only one other pair of hikers as we were packing up to leave toward the falls.  Most hikers go and out back to the falls and on to the lake, so I imagine the western edge of the lake is more crowded.\n\nThe Cataract Trail on the western side of the loop is cooler as it runs by the creek. Instead of slopes with rocks and dirt (on the Kent trail), it has several flights of stairs to make your way out of the canyon. The Cataract Trail has several hikers just coming up to see the falls, so it was a little crowded.\n\nEven on what would be considered a warm day for Mt. Tam, the trail is mostly shaded, so it felt cool.  I didn't need to wear a sunhat, although I always wear sunblock as a precaution as I'm very pale. I am prone to getting bit by bugs, but for whatever reason, I didn't need bug spray on this trail. We did carry some as a precaution.\n\nThe trail is located in the Marin Municipal Water District, but it borders Mt. Tamalpais State Park near the Pan Toll Ranger Station. As another reviewer suggested, it is possible to start closer to the falls, so that you can begin with the uphill part of the loop, this will likely add 30 minutes of driving time (coming from most directions).  I decided I was up for the challenge of going downhill first - I found I was faster going uphill than down because of the steepness of sections of the trail.\n\nWe ended up getting off of the trail at the very end (not sure how), and ended up on the road instead of back to the parking lot. We had to walk on the road for about 400 feet.  I'd recommend brining a photo of the map for this trail on your phone. While the trail is well marked, there are several options for veering onto other trails.  The one recommended on AllTrails (the one we did) combines several trails:\n1) Simmons (very short distance near trailhead)\n2) Benstein\n3) Kent\n4) Helen Market\n5) Cataract\n\nI will certainly be back next year for this one. With any luck I'll be fit enough to extend the loop to visit Bon Tempe Lake along the way."", 'We started the loop at Cataract Trail, from where a 1500ft descent through a decently maintained trail with a lot of staircases leads you to the bottom of the falls. The trail directions seemed a bit messed up so I recommend carrying a map. The second half of the trail is a very good workout, with short bursts of ascents followed by somewhat flat cool down stretches. There is a restroom I have marked on the recording somewhere along the route and there are some at the trail head. There is some argument over the actual distance of this loop. I had 3 devices on me and the distances recorded varied from 7.5 to 8.2miles. This hike is between moderate and hard difficulty so I recommend carrying lots of water and some food to snack on along the way.', 'Great hike, but a word of caution: this is much closer to the ""easy end"" of ""Hard"" rather than a Moderate difficulty trail.  You\'re going to gain a ton of elevation, with almost no let up, on the second half.  The listing here is also a little off -- it is closer to 8 or 8.2 miles than 7.5, though the elevation gain is about the same.\n\nAltogether a beautiful hike though.  Great scenery, almost entirely shaded, lightly trafficked even on a holiday weekend.  Watch out for bugs -- they were really irritating today.', ""Bring bug spray if you're prone to getting bit. I got about 8 mosquito bites. Did the hike from 10am-1:30pm. Even with scorching temps, the mosquitos were still out."", 'Rigorous hike! Great views!', 'Difficulty is more on the hard-moderate scale. Lots of variability in terrain and elevation. Great hike with a beautiful waterfall. I took the hike counter clockwise so got to see the waterfalls early.', ""Great leg workout. I'd scale this on a higher end of moderate. With various inclines and leveled paths this goes back and forth between easy and hard. Walking through the forest in the fog is like descending into another realm. Having done this hike clockwise we got to see all the scenes first with manageable inclines going back up. The loop isn't vague but you pass a lot of intersected trails that can easily throw you off course. Bug repellent is highly recommended."", ""Great hike -- lots of trail changes. Be sure to download the map before getting started since there isn't any service at the parking lot."", 'Beautiful varied terrain. The lake is stunning. Moderately difficult at steeper parts but balanced with flats and downhills.', 'Definitely not easy. Very good place.', ""This is a great loop!  I recommend starting on Kent trail, heading down to the lake and then coming back UP next to the creek.  Most of the trail is shaded, so great for a warmer day.  If you're looking for a hike filled with great vistas, this isn't the hike for that."", 'Loved this hike came here with my boyfriend and we felt like we stepped into a different realm it was so beautiful', 'fun terrain for humans and dogs both. relatively quiet trail except the part from the parking lot to the falls. not a lot of interesting wildflowers. mostly shaded the whole way. a few very short steep parts. the full loop is a bit longer than I would have liked.', ""The cataract falls trail is amazing. We went all the way to the end of the cataract falls trail instead of turning onto the Helen market trail like this AllTrails map tells you to do. The way back up to the Helen market trail intersection was way too steep. The rest of the loop is steep and not too scenic. You're not allowed to swim in the lake. By adding the portion of cataract falls, our total hike was 8.5 miles."", 'We started at Rock Springs parking lot and followed the Cataract Trail all the way to the end for 3.5 miles. We then climbed back onto Cataract Trail and turned left onto Helen Market Trail for 2 miles. This took us to the Alpine Lake. From Alpine Lake we took the Kent Trail all the way back to the parking lot for a total of 9.2 miles with 2,260 elevation gain. This was a wonderful hike. We saw many powerful waterfalls and beautiful Alpine Lake as well as many wild flowers and lush green hills.', 'Started at Rock Springs parking lot and went counterclockwise.  Cataract Falls Trail is steep.  Best time to hike this trail is after heavy rains which make the waterfalls on Cataract Trail incredible - not to be missed!  Alternative route to consider is to start at the dam on Alpine Lake and hike up Cataract and then down on Kent.', 'Many beautiful views of waterfalls along way.', ""Beautiful trail. We did the loop of Cataract Falls, Helen Market Trail, Kent Trail, High Marsh Trail, 75 Yard Trail, Laurel Dell Fire Road, and back to Cataract Falls. Definitely start at the dam and then take the Helen Market Trail. It's much easier to do the stairs of cataract falls at the beginning of the hike compared to trying at the end. \n\nIt had rained for quite a few days before our hike and it rained most of our hike. The falls were so fast and loud, it was amazing. The manzanitas on the High Marsh Trail were beautiful. It was such an amazing hike.\n\nPrint a map and take it with you if your not familiar with all the trail names. This saved us from taking the wrong path a few time. It also let us change our original plan since we were running out of daylight.\n\nAlso give yourself plenty of time. We ended up hiking 45min past sunset and it was difficult to traverse. The gate locks at sunset(we got locked in), luckily we took the road the other way and went around Alpine and Bon Tempe, otherwise we were locked in for the night. \n\nThe incline and stairs can be tiring, but doable. This hike took us about 5 hours with a very short lunch break and multiple quick stops to catch our breath on the stairs. My phone gps said it was 12.5 miles and 165 flights of stairs."", 'Great hike but we were nearly run over by some mountain bikers who were recklessly speeding down a single track trail.

Parked in Rock Spring.', ""We hiked the full loop clockwise, AllTrails says 7.5 miles / 1811ft elevation gain / 4hr 42min.  The time includes a brief water snack break at the lake, and a few stops along the way.  This route is a more gradual hike down to the lake, and a slightly steeper, tougher hike in the second half.  Which was is easier?  Hard to say.  I kept wondering how the heck we are STILL going downward?!  And how the climb back up/out was going to be brutal!  I was stunned by how much water was flowing!  Even compared to Hawaii's waterfalls, it was really going.  And beautiful!  It had rained the night before, but still, amazing.  In spite of that, the trail was not too wet or muddy.  So many cool little bridges, and cascades.  Hope I can hike it again before I leave the Bay."", ""Such a beautifull place but it's kinda of a hard trail bring lots of water too the last half of the trail is nothing but uphill so be ready for a strong finish"", 'Great hike, definitely would recommend going clockwise so that you get the more gradual incline on the end of the hike. Lots of cute waterfalls and redwoods.', 'This trail is amazing!! So beautiful for the fall season.  There are a lot of waterfalls along the trail. A little low on water but it is still worth it,', ""Completed this 8.5 mile hike on an early Sunday morning and was overjoyed with the peace and serenity of the trails (momentarily crossed paths with less than a handful of other hikers). As mentioned in other reviews, the Cataract Trail itself is not a loop, but to make it one involves a few other trails (Helen Market Trail and Kent Trail). I made a few mistakes: backtracked once (I kept walking the Cataract Trail til it hit the road to Bolinas, oops!) and forgot where exactly I had parked so I ended up hiking a few other trails and walking out to the Laurel Dell Trail Head parking lot... then I pathetically walked another 30 mins on Ridgecrest Blvd back to the Rock Springs Trail Head parking lot, which is where I had started the hike. All in all, I'd do it again, and hopefully successfully next time! As suggested by others (and especially by me), KNOW the trails you'll need to hike and used the GPS tracking on the map of this trail just in case, it really was what helped me get a sense of direction!"", ""Great loop! Late-August + Drought = Falls were mostly dry...but the loop was mostly shaded. It was pretty well marked. There are a few other trails that cut across, so be sure to know trail names and routes. I got tripped up at the beginning and started on Bernstein, but fairly easily hooked back onto Kent for my intended route. Kent trail was much less crowded than the Cataract trail, and there's a lovely stop at Alpine lake. No water stops along the way, so bring lots of water."", 'We started at the Rock Springs parking lot in the Mt. Tamalpias State Park. We followed the Cataract Trail, stop by the beautiful Alpine Lake. We made a loop by taking the Kent Trail back. All the waterfalls were dry, but it was still a beautifully wooded and cool trail in the late summer, ascending was bit of challenging.\xa0Total distance was  9 miles and 1880 feet of elevation.  Totally enjoyed.', ""Loved that the trail was marked and clear in the beginning seemingly easy at first. Then it got steep and hard and we got turned around. Our 8.5 mile hike turned into a 12 mile hike. It was very shaded which was a plus. Bring lots of water. We brought our 2 kids they did great but I'm still surprised about that. The falls and creeks were small so I can't wait to go in the spring. We went at the end of summer. Anyhow it was a great hike, do your research cause the names of the trails change. Cataract does not loop. But I'd definitely come back"", 'Great!  Lots of stairs', 'Did the 8.5mile loop counterclockwise with a lunch break at the lake. Our fit bit said it was more like 10miles. Beautiful nature, abundant shade. Free parking. I would say this is a mild- moderate hike. Incline goes up and down so not too tiring. Definitely does not feel like 2100ft elevation- felt more like a few hundred. I was disappointed by that, I was expecting my legs to fall off. The falls was small, looks like a miniature Hawaii scenery. Wear hiking boots, can get slippery. Two members from the group rolled their ankles on rocks and others slipped on leaves.', ""It was a beautiful hike but we weren't prepared for the steep trail to get all the way to the lake.  It was absolutely beautiful, though!"", 'Beautiful trail! Wonderful water falls, creeks, and wildlife. We hiked to Alpine lake and turned around.

It was around a total of 10 miles out and back. There are a lot of different mostly shaded trails/dirt roads you can take depending on what you want to do for the first 5 miles or so.\n\n Once the elevation gain starts, make sure you have water and sun protection because there is no shade like mentioned in previous reviews. However, there is a nice, shaded rest area towards the end of the gain with benches and outhouses. The bathrooms were locked when I was there during the week.\n\nIf you hike the part where the elevation gain starts, I would rate this hike more as moderate just because of how exposed to the sun you are.', 'For Hikers, google ""Marshall Canyon Staging Area"" and start from there.  Alltrails\' map starts off at an elementary school that\'s so far from the actual trail for hikers. \n\nLooking back at the map now, it would be best to go east on Stephens Ranch Road from the staging area.  We ended up going south and then hiked north. It\'s all down hill and little shade. \n\nOnce we arrived at the 3.5 marker (according to Alltrails\' map), we went the in a counter clock wise route.  This is more difficult than going in a clock wise fashion as the east side of the trail is much steeper than the west/north side. I\'ll know now to check out the elevation map for better planning in the future. \n\nThe east side has little to no shade. The west/north has plenty of shade.  \n\nAll the creeks were on vacation, we saw zero bodies of water on this hike during this time of the year, July 29. Was hoping to find a nice shaded hike with streams of water during the heat. \n\nSaw a few bunnies, lizards, ants and snake skins on the trail. \n\nStarted at 3pm and got back at 7pm. Got real dark at 8-820pm in the area. Gates close at sunset or 8pm. \n\nLooking forward to coming back here in Spring time.', 'I have entered the trail in La Verne, near  Live Oaks—around the trail’s 3.5 mile market—and have gone both directions—towards the trailhead in La Verne and the other way up the mountain towards Claremont Wilderness.  It is easy in the La Verne side, but gets progressively more challenging the other way.  Around mile marker 5, the trail starts getting steep and progressively steeper.  Not easy for sure.  I’d say intermediate is more accurate.  Also around there is shade no more!   Good workout, but be prepared and know what you are getting into!!', 'Parked at Oak Mesa Elementary School off Wheeler Ave.  Access to the trail through the park over the wash bride takes you to Los Robles right, to Via De Mansion right, to Orangewood St left, trail head half ways down the block on your left.

The green dot on the map begins at a park off Wheeler and the trailhead from there was too difficult to find and seems to go through a suburb.

Though I cycle around the city for exercise, I was unprepared for the event. \n\nDiscovery #1. I need a better light. \nThe people who brought me had lights that projected far and bright, so I could see well what was upcoming. Mine could illuminate, but not so clearly as to pick out a line to travel, so I stayed behind them most of the way up.\n\nDiscovery #2. The trail is poorly marked.\n\nDiscovery #3. I need a digital tire pressure gauge. \nOne of my friends insisted that I ride up the trail with a full firm tires, even though everything I've read said to lower my fat bike pressure to 8-10 lbs of tire pressure, but he was insistent. Once the ride began, I found myself having to lower tire pressure a few times on the way up as road conditions changed; and especially when starting downhill. Then my front became over-deflated, and combined with my inexperience, I found the bike's handling wanting to pull to the left, and controlling the bike got rather difficult on the way down. I did crash a few times, but attribute my downtime to rider inexperience instead of equipment malfunction. \n\nDiscovery #4. I need to change my gear ratio.\nI primarily ride on the street, and find my gear ratio too low toI discovered my single 38t gear upfront and 7 speed 34t in back is not low enough a gear for ascending the short uphill sections at the start of Marshall, so I ended up walking my bike a lot. Got to some park bench area, which seemed a natural rest area for visitors; then turned around to go back. \n\nDiscovery #5. Starting early has its advantages.\nI've heard that hikers do not like MTB'ers because they are thought to be inconsiderate when flying past them. I discovered early MTB riding is an easy way to reduce the number of obstacles in the trail, be it biker or hiker, but the early AM start time is discouraging. However, as an inexperienced MTB rider, I found their absence to be a blessing. \n\nDiscovery #6 Fauna.\nSaw a deer 10 yards away.\n\nDiscovery #7. (Has nothing to do with Marshall) I need new a wheel set & tire combination\nAfter the ride, my friends weighed my bike with a shipping scale. My Momentum Rocker by Giant weighs 35.8 lbs. That was surprising to them. I had found only one post that listed the bike at 34._ lbs but had my reservations. Putting my bike on the shipping scale brought resolution to this year long quandary. While I ask you to weigh your own Momentum Rocker, you may want to keep in mind one post weighing the bike at 34, and another listing the bike at 35.  \n\nAfter weighing the complete bike, we removed the wheels and weighed the bike again. The scale read 16lbs! \n\nThis means the wheels of my Momentum Rocker by Giant weigh nearly a 20lbs combined! That shocked me and everybody. Again, without tires, the Momentum Rocker by Giant weighs 16 pounds; \n'\nI am pretty certain that Fat Tire Wheel Sets have been advertised at under 5 lbs a pair, and Fat Tires under 4 lbs a pair. This discovery means with an upgrade of a lightweight wheel set & tire combination, the complete fat bike could be under 25 lbs. A 25 lb fat bike is unheard of for $620, but add a new wheel set for $500 or so, and it becomes very possible when upgrading the Momentum Rocker by Giant.  Giant/Momentum does not plan to build another Fat Bike model in the future, from what I heard (and Momentum says riding the Rocker on a trail will violate its lifetime warranty, just fyi).\n\nWeighing my friend's bikes without tires, both my friends' bike's weight came in at about 19 lbs but they have suspension forks, which probably attributed to the variance from my weight. Thus, perhaps my greatest discovery from Sunday's ride, did not come from the ride, but followed after the ride, when we weighed bikes. The basic weight of the Rocker makes it worth upgrading wheels and tires, and though there is a fat bike derailleur mount available, the odd design at the rear of the frame which accommodates its freewheel hub does limit the range of the chain ring, and may make a 2x or 3x crank set an impossibility. \n\nI may post an update to announce my discoveries for anyone interested, especially for other Rocker riders who want to upgrade their bikes who may find my experience useful.\n\nIn conclusion, it may be considered an easy trail for experienced riders, but it is certainly a challenge for new comers. I was taken as far into the trail as my hosts thought my skill could surpass, and then rode back. There were plenty of MTB riders and several hikers this particular Sunday morning.\n\nI expect greater riding skills, like getting your bike to hop over obstacles, develops with practice,  but starting with the proper gearing would help ensure I remain on the trail, and complete more of the trail next time I go out. Afterwards, I might be able  to contribute a more valuable assessment of the trail, albei"", ""It's rated easy, but if your out of shape it's moderate.

I saw deer, dogs, and horses.  The first time I saw the deer it was pure magic.  There were quite a few mountain bikers and equestrians, so you have to kind of scoot to the side when they come by, especially when going downhill as it's hard for them to stop.

As we hike for about 1 hr we started seeing the trail covered in snow then it stayed all the way to the top. With the snow it made the hike harder, but also was really enjoyable. Be careful once you get to the fire road, my brother and I both fell on the way down. We were wearing hiking boots and using treking poles.\n\nAzalea Glen Loop is what makes this hike enjoyable. As we went down the fire road on the way down we both thought we would be disappointed if that was the route to the top we took.\n\nParking at the bottom campground is $10 and the adventure pass is not accepted.', 'Beautiful hike this morning!  I loved this route via Azalea Glen and then through Conejos Trail.  Very peaceful, and great views throughout the hike.  A good amount of mud early along the trail today, and then snow as I got further along (dec 28).  Not too icy though—didn’t need microspikes or anything in today’s conditions.', 'Perfect hike to select on Christmas Eve!', 'Great hike . The view of the whole region from the top would be worth it.

I'd actually suggest doing an out and back on the recommended start to the route so you only do the paved part at the end. Be prepared for some very narrow trails that get pretty rocky (loose in some areas)."", 'I did the loop, and I really liked it! The first part was a rocky trail with lots of great foliage and views. There were a couple of downed trees but I was able to climb over them pretty easily. The top isn’t really that great because there is a bunch of construction equipment and I went pretty early so it was windy. I took the paved path back and it was really easy. I’d definitely recommend doing the loop because the first part had the best views, IMO. Enjoyable, and in the easy to moderate range.Note that there is a $10 state park day fee to park.', 'This was a fun and diverse trail!  We started up the fire road and about two thirds of the way up we were in the clouds.  It was magical!  A good handful of hikers complained about not having the right clothing as the weather from the base to the summit was drastically different.  We took the Azalea Glen Loop trail down.  I was looking forward to some trail running down but the trail was too rocky and unstable; I would go up Azalea Glen Loop and down the fire road if I were to do it again.', 'Dogs are only allowed on the fire road and it is an all uphill paved path this way.

Bring plenty of water; 2 of us brought 80 ounces and it was just enough.', 'Perhaps my favorite hike in San Diego. Challenging, especially the steep grade of the service road, and great views from the summit. Grab a map from the ranger if you’re not very familiar with this area, I had a little trouble finding my way around the loop to the summit the first time I did this hike.', 'Beautiful trail, recommend following the guidance here up Azalea to the right then down the paved road on the way back (not fun for the feet though).Note:  the entrance to Conejos is very difficult to spot, the trail sign is hidden if you’re travelling from Azalea.  Also, bring lots of water and sunscreen.  Park patches, cool gifts, and wildlife display at Cuyamaca Rancho visitor’s center before you get to the campground- worth a stop Sat and Sun 1000 to 1600.  Recommended soundtrack for the drive:  Tin Hat Trio: The Rodeo Eroded.', ""Breath taking trail. The trail has a very sad slow rate of forest regeneration, which prompted a reforestation project to replant using donations. It breaks my heart when I saw such magnificent pines burnt to the core. Quick history: The fire took place in 2003, when a lost hunter lit a signal fire hoping to be found. That signal burned out of control and became the biggest wildfire in California's history, burning more than 300,000 acres, killed 15 people and burned 2400 homes."", 'Love it', 'Great trail I love it', 'Excellent trail, love the view', 'Great forest hike.

Conejos trail is definitely a challenge and it’s a good workout going up.  The views are spectacular.', 'Beautiful views all around and the frosty weather at the top was like the cherry on top. Enjoyed the cold and the icy winds on an other wise warm day in San Diego. We hiked with our dog so we stuck to the paved road (~5.4 mile out and back).

I definitely wasn't prepared for the cold weather and all the snow up there but the hike itself through the woods and meadows was gorgeous. I plan on going back soon to get some better views and hopefully better weather, a lot of fog rolled in on my way up so I didn't get to see any of the scenery from the summit.Pictures and snow slowed me down so I took a little under 4 hours to hike it.

I think the hike is fairly moderate until you get to the last 1/2 mile or so on the fire road, then it's a pretty steep incline to the summit.  This time around we saw some deer close to the campground entrance on the start of our hike and then a coyote in the distance about 1 mile in.

Only draw back is the steep fire road down from the peak...rough on the knees!', 'Fantastic views along the way and the view at the summit is worth the trip. We hiked the Azalea Glen trail to Conejos trail then up to the peak. We took the lookout road back down to the parking and it was not a great trail for views and hard on the knees.

Went on Dec 30 and the weather was perfect. Hiked the loop counter clockwise. The view at the summit is amazing. The only knock on it is if you take the paved road on the way back down it’s tough on the knees/back. My wife and I hiked at a leisurely pace and spent some time at the summit and it took 5 hours.

From the connecting loop we got up to a 4.55 mile to the peak. heading back we took the West Mesa Trail connecting loops. carefully as you can easily get lost.

We hiked it late July, which was hot, so bring lots of water. Parts of the trail have shade, which we took advantage of by resting and fueling up. We saw wildlife, lots of trees, and great vistas.

It was 4 1/2 miles to the peak taking the trails up and 3 miles down the Lookout Fire Road.  We were some of only ones on the these trails going up.  I think we passed two other people.  It was a little warm but there was a nice breeze so it was very bearable.   The trails were nice and shaded part of the way up.  There was a lot of wildflowers and a lot of butterflies.  It was so peaceful. The views at the top were worth the work!  I don't think I'll ever take the Lookout Fire Road up again when you have so many beautiful trails to choose from.  If you want to get to Cuyamaca Peak, definitely check out the trails!"", ""Marching up all that miserable, hard ass pavement is totally worth the view!  First time I ever saw the Salton Sea.

By that I mean there were some good long rang views as expected, but also some forest, some meadows and a stream with plenty of vegetation along it.  The hike up was mostly a paved path so it didn\'t seem as ""natural"" as some hikes, but it still was a bit of a workout.', ""Awesome view from the top. Unfortunately, it's a paved road and not much trail. Steady incline all the way up. Not much to see except on the final destination. Would recommend!!!!"", ""The trail was mystifying. Once you get to some of the fire lane roads it can be a bit confusing so I do suggest getting a map from the rangers.  Beautiful brooks to enjoy and stick your feet in and benches to sit.

Went 2 days after rainfall and it was great having some greenery and a little moisture everywhere.  It was fairly easy in the beginning 30% of the trail then became more difficult from there on. The trail was rocky and seemed to have a stream going through the trail which made it that much more fun.  The peak was beautiful as was expected.  We took the paved road down and we are extremely glad we didn't take it up because there isn't much to see.  We started at Azalea Glen, then Azalea Springs, then Conejos and busted a right on the paved road when it met up with us to the top.  Was really a special hike. Highly recommend.

My 5 yr old little girl conquered the whole 6 miles all the way to the peak. The Conejos Trail was beautiful from Azalea glenn/springs.

This hike is truly beautiful and the views at the top are stunning. There is a small bench a few hundred feet from the last incline that makes for a great pre-summit rest. Plenty of plant life to observe, and gives lots of shade in some parts too. If you take the fire road up it's quicker, steeper and easier (navigation wise) but I think, less pretty. I would say take the trails up and the fire road down, or vice versa."", 'Cuyamaca state park is one of my favorite places, everything right now is green.

We took the trail up by Azalea Glen, Azalea Springs, Conejo Trail and finally the Fire Road. It took us approximately 3 and a half hours to reach the top. Azalea Glen is a gorgeous, leisurely stroll from rolling prairies to lush forest, except toward the end of it. The trail gets quite challenging on Conejo. Overall it was a great hike with beautiful, scenic views. Definitely worth the drive from Imperial.', ""Fairly easy hike up along a paved fire road. There are some areas of steep elevation gain. We brought our golden retriever who loved the walk. This is the only dog friendly train in Cuyamaca Rancho State Park. \n\nIt was rainy, windy, and foggy on the day we hiked, so we didn't see any of the spectacular views. Lots of pretty wildflowers to enjoy along the trail, and you do see a lot of the damage caused by the 2003 Cedar Fire. Completed the hike in about 2 hours."", 'Hard last part.Great cardio.', ""I came up via the fire road. Which didn't bother me as much as I thought it would. It is a pretty hike up and the view from the top is wonderful. It was fairly difficult my heart rate stayed reasonably elevated and I was a bit sore the following morning. I figured I would get some bang for my buck, with the $8 parking, so I headed up stonewall peak trail then afterwards did Cuyamaca."", ""I took this trail up to the peak via Fire Road. It's a paved path and my friend had a dog & it's one of the few trails out there that allows them. You can get to that part of the trail via the Paso Picacho Campground, $8 to park & there's bathrooms. Anyhow, tons of burnt trees out there, but we went on a super foggy morning so it did create sort of this nice, eerie backdrop which allowed for good picture taking :) Saw a bobcat on the way up too. Awesome! Great views pretty much the entire way & wonderful at the top. Breathtaking really. It's not super difficult & plenty of options to stop, rest & take it all in. It's one of my favorite hikes in SD to date & plan to do it again & again. We ventured to Julian after for food & wine tasting - lovely day!"", ""Super windy this morning. I got an early start, so I didn't see anyone else on the trail until I was on my way back. The fires really did a number to the first portion of the trail, mostly burnt/chopped down pine and cedar trees. The top was much nicer with great views. I took the Azalea Glen trail to the  fire road on the way up and the Conejo trail back to Azalea on the way down. Make sure to get a map at the ranger station."", ""Just finished this trail. Went up the Azula Springs side and ran down the road. Took just over two hours. Make sure to stop at the lookout on your way up, the view was so beautiful it surprised me. Insanely windy today so I didn't spend much time at the top but it's the journey not the destination."", 'Did this hike in early January. From a barren wasteland to a lush forest, we made our way through a variety of trails interspersed with patches of snow and fallen trees all culminating in one of the most spectacular views in San Diego. We even got to do some light rappelling and tree climbing at the 6,500 ft peak!\n\nWe took the Azalea Glen loop to Azalea Springs, then to Conejos Trail to the Lookout Fire Road finally to the peak. We took the Lookout Fire Road all the way back to starting point for about 7.5 mile loop.\n\nGreat moderate hike with a kind of foreboding scenery with all the burnt and fallen trees. The scenery does gradually change and is a nice forest near the peak. The views at the peak are some of the best in Southern California. I definitely recommend this hike as it has it all!\n\n*Parking is $8 so definitely carpool if you can!', ""I hit both Stonewall and Cuyamaca peaks in the same November day, starting at the Paso Picacho campground.Both were great hikes with quite a lot of different scenery and beautiful sounds of birds much of the time.  I'm glad I brought a jacket and gloves (and shorts, this is still southern California) - it was chilly in the morning and also chilly/windy on the peaks.  Much of the trek was well shaded as well.All the trails are well marked, so just have a map handy, as there are quite a lot of options if you want to do more than just go up and back.  The whole park is gorgeous!  Bring some binoculars for the tops as well - the views are as well!I saw a fair number of hikers throughout the day, but spread out quite a bit.  I did not see any deer as others have mentioned in the past, bummer!"", ""If you avoid the fire road, there is almost no one on the trail (even at 11:00am on a saturday). There are a good deal of fallen trees to climb over, but that's part of the fun! I managed to take a wrong turn twice and turned a 4 hour hike into a 5.5 hour hike, so watch your map. The view from the top is beautiful, but the large amount of electrical equipment spoils the ambiance a bit."", 'Went there first weekend of February 2014 and the temp was 37 degrees at the Paso Picacho campground ($8 to park) parking lot.  It was a nice treat to see icicles on the bushes, the trees, even at the tower.  It was a short hike and the trail was very easy to follow.  After all, you are following a fire road.  The peak was very beautiful and the burnt trees offered their own beauty.  Another peak across is the Stonewall Peak which at first glance might seem higher than Cuyamaca but definitely not.  The air got a little thinner towards the top but the air was crisp and very rewarding and worthwhile vista is waiting for you at the top!', 'This was a great hike. I really appreciated how empty the trials were at 8AM. So much fun and serene.', 'Lovely trail all around. I would avoid the access road unless you enjoy walking on asphalt instead of the dirt -- albeit, the access road is substantially shorter. The trail is seldom traveled, I ran into two solo hikers throughout the hike. The chilly temperatures made the experience and little bit more technical, however, the amazing view from the top definitely made the trek worthwhile.', 'Nice trail. Beautiful view from the top. Neat to see the regrowth of the forest, especially on the Conejos trail. ', ""Took my 11yo son. parked at Milk Ranch road on the 79. Took it up to Azalea springs fire road with lots of deer on the way. Then took Canejos trail to the peak. Lunch at the peak, then down the lookout road back to Azalea springs fire road. Stopped at the springs.... Nice. Then proceeded back to Milk Ranch. We decided there was enough daylight and energy to tackle Middle peak. So we took the Black oak trail up to the middle peak fire road and back down to the 79. Tons of deer. Some as close as 50' throughout the day. Saw some Turkeys in the early am. Trails were mostly graded fire roads, except for the paved section to the peak. Total distance of 12 miles and 2 mountains hiked. The hot tube in our apartments came in very helpful in recovery. Oh, and the view from the peak is way so worth it..."", ""I do believe that the 45 min drive to Cuyamaca State Park is worth it once you reach the top of Cuyamaca  Peak. I took the Azalea Glen Trail Loop to Pico Picacho to the Fire Road to the Lookout all the way to the top. If you're in fairly decent shape, then the hike shouldn't be too bad, as its around 7-8 miles round trip. If I had to pick the hardest part of the trail, it would probably be the last 1.5 miles hiking up the fire road is it can get pretty steep, but if you hiked El Cajon mountain in San Diego then it about that same grade or easier. I arrived in the morning and it was about 50 degrees and then later in the afternoon the temperature rose quickly to 70 degrees, so bring clothing to adapt to the environment. Pack a snack or a light lunch to enjoy once you reach the peak. Great photo opportunities at 6512 feet!!"", ""For climbing up 1500' feet, this was much easier than we thought it would be.  By heading up the Conejos trail - as opposed to just walking straight up the fire road - the grade is much less.  There are also far fewer people; we didn't see anyone until the Conejos trail joined up with the fire road just below the summit.  We did, however, see two groups of deer, plus a number of birds and wildflowers.  Despite being a mile high, we didn't really notice any shortness of breath from the elevation.  The trail is in good shape, and just sort of meanders about through the forest, which is coming back from fires a number of years back.  Because of the elevation, the temperature was comfortable.  Of the various hikes we've done in San Diego (Hot Springs Mtn, Palomar Mtn, Mt Woodson, etc.) this one was our favorite.  And that was even without a view from the top (it was foggy and so the view to the west wasn't very far).  We came back down the fire road, and the total length was 7.4 miles, and it took us right at 3 hours."", 'Went back in January, still fresh snow on the ground, as I got higher up it began to snow some more and made this a very adventurous hike! Would definitely recommend this hike. Beautiful scenery ans an amazIng hike.', 'This trail is absolutely awesome. Very scenic the whole way up. Lots of shade and plenty of spots for rest if you need it. Bringing a camera is a must do for this hike!!

The only sad part is that people on these trails don’t embrace or don’t know the concept of “leave no trace”. It was sad to see some trash (we picked it up) we saw graffiti on trees (what big of a loser had to do that? ) and seeing pictures of people who picked flowers (food for pollinators, hello) honestly, we don’t live in a fairy tail anymore and it’s not news we must take care of the planet.

There’s a part of this hike that is after you come downhill all the way, there’s a beautiful stretch of trees and foliage that made us both fall in love with the hike even more. There’s also quite a bit of shade that made the hike more enjoyable in comparison to Hellman’s Park (in close prox to this trail) that has almost no shade at all. Would come again because of the experience we had—there were also a lot of options for trails which was nice as well. Next time will try the Coyote Trail.', 'Steep. Steep. Steep. Did I say steep.

It never ceases to amaze me how you can find open spaces in the middle of a metropolis like Los Angeles, this one is just of the Pomona Hwy near Avocado Heights and the City of Industry. Not surprisingly, this trail is heavily trafficked on most parts. Also worth noting is that some parts of the trail are shared with Bikes and Horses, though we only saw a couple of bicyclists and horse apples but no horses. The trail head has a small parking lot, with only a couple of spots but there is more parking down by the street by the Orange Grove Middle School sports field.

I do this pretty often when I want to get a good hike in close by. You park off 7th and Orangegrove in Hacienda Heights. After a quarter mile walk up the gravel road, I branch off to the left up the Coyote trail. There's pretty good elevation gains that can tire you out if you're not ready for it. The trail has a lot of switch backs. Once you get to the top of the first hill, at the electric towers, you can start heading back down toward where you started, OR you can decide to complete the beast and take the half mile level walk to the next set of hills, which are larger, with more elevation gains and switchbacks.

The trail is located in the San Gabriel Valley, a bit South of the City of Industry and off of the 60 Freeway; about 15 to 20 minutes to the east of Downtown Los Angeles (on the weekend).  So, quite accessible during the weekends (I say weekends because the 60 Freeway gets very congested during the work week.).  The first mile or so of the trail is all uphill with about 767 feet of elevation gain, followed by about a quarter of a mile to one-half mile of level ground, and the rest is all down hill.  This trail profile will give one a good idea of how well the new gear performs.  This trail is a part of a larger trail system managed by the Puente Hills Habitat Preservation Authority, which will give one considerable flexibility in testing gear.  If the approximately4 miles of this loop trail is not enough for one to get a feel for the new gear, then one can take any one of the connected trails and extend the test run up to 12 miles of up hills, down hills, and rocky slopes with lose dirt.\n\nIn addition to providing a convenient location to test equipment, this trail is also a good place to ease into the start of a hiking season.  Depending upon the trails taken in this network of trails, one can get from 700 to 1000 feet of elevation gain, much of it in the first mile.   This moderate elevation gain will serve as a nice way to ease the body back into trail shape.   Since the trail is in the San Gabriel Valley, it starts at about sea level, so there is no issue with having to deal with higher altitudes.\n\nFinally, this trail is a good place for those who want to make trail running and mountain biking a part of a varied fitness routine.  However, if one is looking to commune with nature during one\'s fitness routine, then this is not the place.  The fact that this trail is managed by the Puente Hills Habitat Preservation Authority pretty much says it all.  This Authority was  created to acquire and manage green space, for public use, in order to balance the effects of the Puente Hills Landfill, the largest landfill in the United States.  This green space is bordered by a few suburban bedroom communities, a middle school, the 60 Freeway, the aforementioned landfill, and the Rose Hills mortuary and cemetery; all of which are visible, or in case of the Freeway heard, at times on the trail, in addition to the power lines and towers crossing the trail at places.    This is not to say the trail is anything like an urban park trail where one is essentially hiking on fire access roads.  The trail is really well maintained and marked, and the users are generally respectful and appreciative of it.  This trail is even much better than some of the more accessible trails in the Angeles National Forest (now National Monument).  Also, though hikers will be sharing some of this network of trails with mountain bikers and horse riders, there are trails in this network which are for hiker\'s only.  \n\nIn sum, a  nice, accessible trail.  Free parking, but very limited.  There is plenty of street parking in the nice residential neighborhood.', 'Good alternative to Hellman. On the back side of the same hills. Actually connects to Hellman at the top of the ridge. Some shade over a lot of the trail. Steep canyon in the center and switch back trails on either side. Coyote trail pretty steep, better to go up the main trail and back down coyote.', 'This trail is cool as in shady so I liked that. However the mountain bikers were a bit nerve racking.I wouldnt wear my ear phones as some mountain bikers flying down the mountain will not yell out to give you a heads up.', ""hiking with my dog, good for a beginnermake sure u where hiking shoes/bootsI'd do it again, meet some cool ppl with there kids also."", ""I hike and go mountain biking here and it's so much fun. Many trails to try when hiking from easy to advanced trails and for mountain biking plenty of jumps to hit on the way down"", 'This is a cool little spot to go hiking and mountain biking! They have steep inclines that just let you be free and forget about everything! beautiful scenery and close to downtown LA.', 'Very nice hike!! My kids love it!', ""This is my favorite of all the Habitat Authority managed trails.  I like to hit this after work.  you can make it a approximate 3, 4, or 5 mile loop.  You'll find some steep inclines and panoramic views of the San Gabriels to the north, and all the way to Catalina to the south on a clear day.  Some of the trails permit mt. bikes, so keep your ears open!"", 'I LOVE this beautiful trail but HATE all the bikers flying down!', 'I took my daughter (4 years old) and she loved it. There were some difficult sections for her but overall it was very safe. Definitely going again.', 'Good hike! Easy to get lost and has a lot of diversity!', 'Went there today with my dog (Tuesday) and there were a few mountain bikers (that come flying down the hills so look out) but not many hikers. I got kind of scared if I am honest. LOL! Next time I will bring a buddy because it is kind of deserted on weekdays (today is new years so that could be part of it too.) Good trails. I fell coming down so I could recommend shoes with better traction or hiking pole thing. Good workout.  Takes me about 1 hour and 40 minutes to complete. (Edited to add, check your dog for ticks after this one.)', ""Took my boys ages 8,5, and 4 on this hiking trail! This is only their 2nd adventure hiking!  I didn't realize this trail is on the backside of Turnbull Canyon! I prefer this hike as it was more colorful and seemed taken care of! The boys wished for a waterfall! I would pack snacks for your break at the top! And bring bug spray!!!!"", ""Trailhead is easy to find, and right off the freeway. There are only a few spots for hiking, but there is parking available in the residential neighborhood. \n\nTrail is well kept and pretty well used. It's a good hike with sections of dense trees further in. During the summer, it's incredibly dry, dusty and hot. It's a a little less than moderately challenging hike. Steep hills at points, but levels out. Great place to trail run and be in mind that you share the trail with mtn bikers."", 'Wow....what a work out!  Lots of uphill action to get your heart pumping and quads burning.  everything was brown and dry in the heat of the summer, but we did spot four deer on our hike.  The mountain bikers come flying down the hills, so if you hike with music, keep one ear clear', 'good workout and elevation gain. not impressed with the scenery compared to other hiking trails.  when you get close to middle of the loop look down for the car at the bottom of the mountains, that was kinda cool. lots of wildlife.', 'Pleasantly surprised!  I typically hike mt wilson,  never realized that this trail existed without trails.com.  The trail is a five minute drive from my house and the intensity is perfect for some decent cardio.  I like the various looping and connecting trails and I am feeling motivated to do some mountain biking!  This will definitely be a frequent trail for me and my wife.', 'This trail was really awesome!!! What I liked most about it was that every direction had two routes. One route for easy hiking and one route for difficult hiking. (My group of 4 at one point split in 2 groups of 2 on a trail that had a difficult and easy route. By the time we both reached the end, we were able to easily find each other). The views on this trail were beautifully pleasing to the eyes! There were people here with their dogs and children so go get out there and have a fun hike with the family!', ""I recommend to thoses who haven't hike on this trail you will enjoy it..."", 'a very good Hike. nice scenery just be careful with the rattle snakes...', 'NICE!', 'One of my favorite trails. You can mountain bike and run it. Great workout and beautiful view in the spring.', 'Good, semi-steep trail. Shaded at points, but can get warm in open ground. Views throughout are worth the climb. Even saw a coyote. Lots of hikers and trail can be narrow at points so hike early.', 'amazing views once you get high enough up the hill.  narrow trail and green shrub all around. lots of rabbits and birds. dog friendly!', 'Beautiful', ""I had fun hiking on this trail making a loop using the Ahwinga Trail and I believe Coyote Trail? Anyways, pretty steep at first but well worth it for the views. Ended up going to the Turnbull Canyon Water Tower in the middle which made this hike well worth it. I recommend it for that sight, it's a muse see in person. Way back was narrow and not as hard as going up. Good overall. So do it ya weenie!"", 'Nice steep trail so you get a good workout, but the payoff is views in all directions. Betting on a clear day you might see the ocean. Downtown LA was beautiful in the distance. Lots of mountain bikes though, so have to be careful. Took our kids and they enjoyed it also.', ""This was my first hike and I really enjoyed it.  Parking is free either at the school parking lot across the street or on the street.  I got there for a 9am group hike with the Puente Hills Preserve Hikers that I joined through Meetup.com.  I really loved how green the trail was with just hints of flowers here and there.  Even though we came across other hikers and bikers, it wasn't crowded and their were pockets where our group were the only ones visible.  The inclines weren't too severe and they were doable at a slower pace.  I'm goin' back again, enjoy!"", ""Very nice nature trail. Many trails to take. Did this as a loop. Trails along the ridge were forest like. Only negative I'd say is the construction at top, but you can walk right through it"", 'This place needs some signage!  Otherwise, I enjoyed the hike.  I ended up doing some of the trails twice to complete a double figure eight type loop. If you start on the ahwingna trail it is really easy to miss the native oak trail split, as its almost behind you as you walk by where it intersects. If you catch that trail then you can do a kind of double figure eight to see most of this section of the Puente Hills.  The views are surprisingly good and you can see the ocean on a clear day.  Nice hike hidden in the middle of suburbia, 5.4 out of 10.', 'Hidden gem with connecting trails.   Very crowded.  Recommend doing early or late afternoon.  Bicylists are not mindful of hikers so be weary.', 'Hidden gem.  Plenty of trails to take from easy to hard.  Have done several times and will definitely return as the time changes.', 'A very nice and moderate hiking experience. Very easy to find the entrance, and conveniently outlines the different trails one can take. The trail we took kept us sweating with our heart rate up -not difficult, just a good workout. The only cons potentially involved were the little bugs (flies) that somewhat followed you everywhere and the lack of rocks or spots to sit along the way. But really, these are small nuances. I definitely enjoyed the hike and the sights along the way.', 'I hike the trail today and was a little confuses with the directions. There are 2 place you can start the hike. The directions all trails directed me to was at the end of Orange St. However the actual trail head is at the corner of 7 St and Orange; which has a map with a overview of the area. You need to park on the street because there is only 5 parking space at the trail head. I would suggest that you bring plenty of water and a camera; there are some great viewing points.  Most likely will do this hike again but will start earlier in the mourning. This time of the year it really get hot.', 'Was kinda disappointed with this hike. Read the reviews and was really looking forward to a more picturesque hike with more of nature to see as well as creeks. Did see a lot of rabbits, lizards and deer. Overall it was a pretty good workout.', ""This is part of a wonderful set of trails tucked in the eastern part of LA County.  I run these trails often, and there is a variety of terrain along the trail, from fire roads to single track.  The environment definitely changes as you move from the shaded canyons to the open coastal sage and scrub at the ridge lines.  The initial climbs can be a challenge, but once at the top it flattens out and you're treated to an expansive view of Southern California."", 'Fun hike with great views. Moderate amount of people--It is not the most secluded trail.', 'I love these trails there are so many. They got me to really start enjoying hiking. You have your saturday or sunday morning hike going up thru 7th st trail and then also your after work trail coming from Turnbo Cyn / Beverly  both leading to the victory ""Water Tower"". It awsome cant wait to experience other trails. ', 'Amazing hiking. A mix between hiking and history with beautiful nature surround. I recommend a good hiking shoes, plenty of water.', 'This is a great trail to go for a quick trail run or a relaxing hike through the canyon.  Dogs are not allowed on this side of the ridge and there are also a lot less people.  By going up the ridge you can connect to the Hellman loop for a round trip of 6.5 miles.  You can also branch off and go to the water tower or rattlesnake ridge.  Its not the most amazing hike you will go on but being so close its a great place to go after work.', 'This is a good trail accessable from many different areas if you just feel like going for a nice one or two hour hike.  It branches off from Schbarum park and goes up the mountain near the top of Azusa Ave.  One section goes to Hacienda Blvd and stops.  You can also access from Hacienda Hills near 7th Ave.  All in all a good hike with alot of wildlife.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '',

Of course a must on every drive down Hwy 1!', 'Very short. $10 fee for parking if you park in the state park parking lot. And once you get to the walkway a large portion of it is closed off which was disappointing because it would be a much better view of the falls if we could go further out on the walkway/viewpoint. With that being said the portion of the walkway that was closed off did look very decrepit. But you’d think with the hundreds of dollars they make per day on parking alone that they’d fix the walkway of one of the most famous sights on Hwy 1 but I digress. My suggestions would be to park along the highway to save the $10 (or pay and hope they fix the walkway at some point). I also think you may be able to see the falls from the Hwy just north of the parking lot. We missed it yesterday but are planning on stopping there today.

The view of the beach from the road is actually better than from the trail, because half of the trail was closed off due to instability of cliff face. There is a huge logjam of people at the place where the trail is closed. The walk from trailhead to turnaround is less than 10 min. Don’t even bother with the day use parking, it’s always full. There is ample parking on road, but make sure you don’t cross the white line at side of lane. Two rangers were out giving tickets to any car that was parked over the line.

The hike gets really steep towards the north peak. Recommended to do it early in the day so you are done by noon.', 'Steep and beautiful views.', 'Very steep coming up or down from parking area...but not so steep that I had to slide on my butt.', '', 'Hidden gem sandwiched in between San Francisco and Half Moon Bay. Beautiful coastal views. Not as hectic as other over hyped trails in the area. Nice Fresh air. You might spot a whale or two on the lower end.', 'Beautiful and eerie pre-dawn October run up Montara Mountain. After heading out from the TH, I dropped down a bit and took the old road around a half mile in. About 2 miles in to the climb the trail gets a bit steep, but is non-technical and easy to follow even in the dark. I continued to climb up through and above the marine layer, feeling like I was in the Lost Boys. After about 4 miles, I reached the North Peak and took the fast decent back down.', 'Got right up on the North Ridge- way above the fog', ""Good route. I've done other hikes from Grey Whale Cove this was the first deserving of the hard rating.  The combination of the two steep sections and that you tackle the entire 2k incline in the first part of the hike keeps you on your toes. \n\nI chose to hike up to the peak and then run down, with a few exceptions where it was too steep to run and stay in control."", ""Great hike with gorgeous views of the peninsula.  From the top, you'll be able to see Mount Diablo and Mount Tamalpais off in the distance.  There are two really steep sections of the trail.  Namely, the section right at the beginning near the parking lot area and the last section of the Fly Amanita trail (the narrow one with a bunch of switchbacks that goes through a forested section) before you meet up with Old San Pedro Mountain Road.  It wasn't easy getting down the latter (which was at least a 50-degree slope)—we had to slide down the dirt right at the junction."", ""this is pretty similar to Mission Peak but with way better views and less people. definitely go before noon because it'll get hot. at a moderate pace finished in about 2 hours."", 'was a nice hike', 'Challenging but manageable- just the right amount of steeps', '1:49 mins', 'Nice views while hiking, however trail was not so great. Ending was terrible as it was just telephone lines and machines. Very foggy and humid throughout hike.

Looking for something more naturey.', 'good all around trail but the view can get foggy', ""Fantastic hike! The first incline to the tree at the top of the hill (you'll know what I'm talking about) is rough but it will get you geared for the rest of it.  Kind of a steady incline to the peak with a few flat runs scattered.  Beautiful views.  I agree with the poison oak overgrowth at this time of year in the lower/starting areas so definately wear something that covers your arms and legs unless you're lucky enough to not have a poison oak allergy?  A highly recommended hike, enjoy!"", 'Went on Saturday with my dog. Parking lot was crowded. It was around 11:30am. Still, we had a great time. Got a little confused as the main entrance had a sign for no dogs but then the trail entrance had a sign for dogs allowed on leash. The beginning of the trail is narrow with lots of vegetation on each side. Didn’t see poison oak on that portion but there was definitely some in the first 1.5 - 2 miles. The first 1.5 miles is all steep uphill but there is a stop where most of the people sat down to rest and take in the beautiful scenery of the ocean. The next 2-3 miles is not bad at all, some uphill but not too inclined. Some hikers wearing shorts were turned away by the poison oak. It was a sunny day, not a lot of shadow until you reach the paved trail then you can find some shelter under the trees. The weather was nice, at 69 degrees. At the top of Mt Montara I only saw one tree to find shelter from the sun. Wear your sunscreen! And then prepare those knees for going down. I was kind of in a rush so I cut through the mountain downhill. Had to use my hiking poles to support my knees. But you can try to find some alternative trail that gives you a much decent descent. Great place with awesome views! If you don’t enjoy the crowd or the sunshine on your face I recommend you go early.', 'Great trail! I would highly recommend sunscreen as there is little to no shade. Also, currently as of today, 6/1/2018 there is a lot of poison oak on the trail beginning at the trailhead to about 1/4 mile up the trail. It took me 2.5 hrs up and down, would do it again!', 'Great trail and amazing views. Only complaint is that it is so overgrown and with so much poison oak spilling onto the trail.  Suggest long pants and long sleeve shirt. Oak in some areas 5 + feet tall.', 'Beautiful ocean views, lots of wildflowers and a decently challenging hike. Hiking poles would be helpful for the way down. Cons are a little crowded, cell towers at the top and on a fire road most of the time. Definitely worth doing, get there early!', '', 'The views are amazing! Hiking shoes and sticks recommended!', 'The views on the way up are beautiful. Lots of greenery and sea views.

Don’t much care for the paved roads but overall a good exhilarating climb.', 'Pretty steep climb but the view of the ocean is spectacular!', 'Really steep in sections, huge payoff!', 'It should be rated as moderate instead of hard. Part of the challenge is not the steepness of trail. It’s just that trail is too slippery with bits and pieces of sand soil and gravels. Scenery is ok not fantastic. Trail is mainly exposed in sun. Not that comfortable. Probably not be back next time. Do also notice some part of trail u could smell strong animal wastes. On the bright side. It was good exercise!', 'Excellent trail. Not that hard even though it climbs up steadily', 'Loved how it was broken up into thirds. First part was fairly easy, second more rigorous, and the third leveled out a bit.

We agreed on this hike rating a 6 out of ten."", ""Nice reasonably challenging uphill in the first 2 miles and made me feel I got in some good exercise when I reached the top.  Downhill side was prettier because part of it passed through a shaded treelined area.

The views along the way are stunning and keep changing! You get everything from beautiful beach views, to parts that feel like an enchanted forest, to hard uphill dirt paths. Climate changes from cool and breezy to hot and sunny. It's the full package."", 'Great hike ! Not as difficult as all trails wants you to believe :):)', ""Would rate this easy to moderate. On a beautiful day with no fog, you can see pretty far out, we could see Mount Diablo from where we were. Great trail with plenty of beautiful views of the surrounding area and the Pacific Ocean! Parking at the trailhead can get tricky, but there's a bigger lot for the beach farther down, though walking to the trailhead on the highway can be a little nerve wrecking (especially when you have two pups in tow)"", ""One of the better down hill experiences yet! I recommend taking the trail side up instead of the road -- it's tough, but doable geared really low. Check the weather before heading out here to see if it's cloudy.

Parking lot was crowded at 4 on a Sunday (figures) I got a little lost, which is pretty typical for me, maybe others won\'t have the same problem. Definately wouldn\'t consider this ""hard."" More easy-moderate. A few steep sections but they are brief and infrequent. Would be a killer cardio workout on a mountain bike. Didn\'t go the last .5 miles because it looked like the view didn\'t change much & it was getting dark. Was enjoyable & pretty, not too crowded once you made it out a bit from the parking lot. Would definately do again.', ""It's a nice climb to the top and the views are great. However much of the trail is badly eroded and off camber. Also the downhill grind is fairly boring."", 'Great hike. Took about 3 hours to finish. Awesome view of the coast. Definitely would do it again!', 'Perfect hike for 360 ocean views and of the SF peninsula! I have to say while this hike is rated Hard, overall the route was a Moderate level. The only strenuous parts I encountered were the steep inclines (mostly in the beginning, and a few times during the mid-leg). Once I got past those, I felt the route was relatively smooth. It\'s pretty much a fire road all the way to the summit.*TIPS: Bring extra layers, it can get chilly with the sea breeze towards the tops. Go on a clear day so you can get the full experience of the oceanic views. Those steep inclines I mentioned, may get slick on the way down if you go on a dry, summer day. Stick to Spring or Fall for this trail.**Optional: instead of opting for the marked summit past the radio towers (which is a small area covered by small shrubs-- and slightly anti-climatic), there\'s a short dirt trail that forks off (maybe 7 mins before the final stretch to the actual summit trail). Explore a neat little alcove/""cave"" and an epic ocean view (if you continue the dirt trail behind the ""cave"").', 'one of the best hikes to frequent!', 'Strenuous uphill with terrific views.

My friend and I only hiked up for about an hour and got up to about 1000+ft elevation. most of the trail is a vertical walk I've been on many hikes and know what to expect for my friend this was only her second so we took frequent breaks. you can tell not too many people take these trails, which is a plus. The highlight for me was you can feel the ocean breeze (which cleared my allergies) and at the same time the flowers around you have an incredible sweet smell."", 'Great views.

Knowing the climate near Pacifica, Fall would be the optimum season for clear weather.', ""This is a very nice trail. Starts off simply enough and continues level along the coastline. But don't let that fool you! It then turns upward as you head towards the mountain top. The views are still fabulous but eventually you lose site of the coastline. Some of the trails have pretty steep climbs but it is gorgeous up there and you are assured that it's all downhill on the return. There are many trails but two ways to get back to the McNee parking lot. One winds down slowly and is probably the way you came up. The other kind of cuts through the hills and is good for the way back down.\n\nDidn't make it to the top but was very close. Strenuous hike for sure if you attempt to summit."", ""I really enjoyed this hike.  I brought my dog with me, and we did really great.  I went on a Monday, and had the whole place to myself.

There were some steep inclines that get your heart rate up, but other than that it was a very comfortable trail to hike on.  I'll definitely be going back!"", 'This is one of my favorite trails. A  steep  incline and great work out with a spectacular view. I find it to be the best at sunset if you have a flashlight for the return downhill. ', 'Amazing view of Pacific Ocean!

Felt like I was going through different climates at certain stages. The rope down to the falls can be iffy but once your down there its gorgeous. There was some water on the falls but not gushing.', 'It’s amazing.', 'Great hike with variations over landscapes, vegetation, and elevation. Wish to see more water falling in my next visit.', 'lj', 'One of the nicest close-in to Los Angeles hikes. There are a few ""steeper"" sections but truthfully this is a very moderate hike. One wanders between canyon and exposed hillsides, so I would not recommend this one on a hot, sunny day. Cooler days, or early mornings are best. Although not maintained, the trail is fairly well preserved until around the 3 mile mark, and then it does get a bit overgrown, but still passable. I have yet to go beyond the 4 mile mark and so do not know how open it is, but it should connect to the Condor Peak trail at some point. Further up the canyon there are multiple stream crossing, so if water is running it might be best to wear water-proof boots. On weekends, the trail can be fairly busy up to the falls, but beyond that the traffic is light. Very nice and pleasant.', 'River and falls still dry. No sign of crazy pitbull today. Path in great shape.', 'Amy, I strongly urge you to contact  Animal Control, which is the correct agency to handle the issue of the pit bull on this trail.  Pit bulls are not inherently or naturally vicious, they have to be mistreated in order to become vicious.  Often they are intentionally mistreated so that they can be used in inhumane dog fights, other times they are mistreated and used to deter detection of other illegal activities that people might be engaged in.  Additionally, this poses a HUGE public safety risk.  Your friend got bit and apparently not too badly, but a smaller human being could have their throat ripped out and every year people die from pit bull  maulings.  Please take action now!', 'Be careful, there is a vicious pit bull chained up at the cabin at the trail head.  Today it was out on the trail and bit my hiking companion.  We left and the family still didn’t have it under control. It was terrorizing other hikers.  Not sure what to do since the bite wasn’t disfiguring but it was bloody.  I am not sure if it warrants police action.', 'We went shortly after it rained, so in the part of trail that Teresa (previous poster) mentions where it gets a bit narrow, we didn’t have any issues with slipping because the sandy dirt was firm from the rain. Unfortunately, the waterfall was nowhere to be seen, even after the rain but — it’s a fun trail regardless. It has a nice mix of winding through dense vegetation and hiking around the hillside.We went on a cool day, but we still brought a fair amount of water for us and our dog.', ""Most of this trail is fairly easy and fun; although with very little shade.  The draught has left no signs of a waterfall which I expected but we couldn't determine where one would be. Beautiful scenes with mountains surrounding.  After about 3.8 miles in the trail becomes less maintained and more of a jungle. Long pants are recommended if you go pass this point. Lots of little thorny plants that will leave scratches.  Parts of the trail past this point were eroding and soft sand making it dangerous for the inexperienced hiker. I would recommend this hike and I would do it again but turn around about 3.5 miles in."", ""not a bad hike but not much water at all this time of year and the tail endof the hike there's not much shade but my buddies saw a bear. it should be nicer once we get some rain"", ""This is our favorite Trail in our area.

Easy to moderate incline closer to the falls area. Worth the hike. No water last weekend Sept 1 2018. But cool being under where the water fall would be. Also steep decent into falls area but very manageable with rope that is there.', 'this trail has a little of everything.', 'It was a pretty intense hike for a beginner like me.  I went on a Saturday and ran across 15 other hikers on this trail (September 1, 2018) It’s a lot of up hill and not much shade. The beginning of this hike is beautiful but the middle to end is uphill and no shade at all (bring sunblock) I also saw lizards, dragonfly’s and a deer! No falls at the end, kind of bummed but gives me more of a reason to go back ☺️ Took about 3hours round trip. Tips:•Bring enough water•wouldn’t bring small dogs •walking stick•sunscreen •picnic area half way through hike**Also I didn’t have an Adventure pass and had no problems**', 'Nice moderate hike. There’s some elevation gain but nothing drastic. A little shade as you go but mostly you’re under the sun. Went on a Saturday afternoon and came across only a handful of people. Overall I enjoyed it. Just don’t expect the falls to be moving if it hasn’t rained in a long time.', 'Started from Big Tujunga Cyn road, as the gate to the trailhead was locked.    Started out at 7:20 AM.    It was dry, but very beautiful vistas the whole way.   I rate this trail intermediate.    Sun hit me at 8 AM where the trail is high on the ridge.    Took some pictures of the falls and back to my car at 9:20.   Al in All, a really awesome hike.', 'Beautiful', 'Definitely on the easier side of moderate but a very nice morning hike. beginning is a mix of shaded and exposed sections of trail with light incline criss-crossing dry river beds which is expected in mid July.', 'This was the first hike I’ve ever done so I am an out of shape BEGINNER. Took me about 2 hours to get down to the waterfall. Don’t be intimidated by the rope assist to get to the base of the waterfall. I was able to do it with a bit of effort. Not a lot of water but it was so worth getting down there. I really enjoyed this hike and will definitely return.', '**I did not buy an adventure pass and had no problems** Great trail! Began hike Saturday at 6:45 a.m. with one other car in the parking area-returned to 7 more cars at 9:15. Still, definitely a lightly traveled trail-saw 4 or 5 other hikers on the path. Not much incline (most of it approaching the falls) so I’d say this is easier than other “moderate” trails. Saw a rabbit and plenty of birds, lizards, bugs, hummingbirds, and tadpoles. Great views of the mountains from the floor of the canyon. Fine for dogs. Nice picnic area about 3/5 of the way to falls. Falls itself is definitely pretty, although not a ton of water in late June.', 'My hiking group hikes at night, and we hiked this on a Thursday night around 11pm. We all had bright lights, nothing crazy or scary. Really cool waterfall at the end with a steep descent down and a rope to hold on to. Good hike.', ""nice day hike. don't be intimidated of the rope assisted descent it's worth the effort. some poison oak along trail but easily avoidable"", 'Fairly easy hike except near the falls with steep descents that were too tough for young kids. Majority of hike was pretty and trail was well maintained.', 'Beautiful walk and waterfall.', 'Beautiful hike with a lot of lush growth and some wildflowers!

Bring lots of water', 'Beautiful trail!', ""This hike was great although I decided to hike in the afternoon... in June... with no clouds in sight! There are a few patches of shade but once in the gulch it's pretty much sun all the way. it was about 2.3 miles in to the falls so 4.6 round trip. I did it in 2 hrs and 6 min not including the short time i rested at the falls. Overall a pretty easy hike with a few inclines that make you dig in and push. Once you see the falls the fork will come up quick to a steep decent which a portion has a rope for you to use to hold on to. I wouldn't recommend it to the faint of heart, any timid beginners, elderly, people in improper hiking footwear or young children. there was water but the falls weren't magnificent. I'll definitely have to come back after a rainy day!"", 'Awesome hike!', 'Trail isnt maintained very well but was really not too much of a hinderance. I walk in shorts and apart from brushing a few branches was otherwise unscathed. Trail was really easy to follow and the waterfall and views back across the canyon were well worth the climb in height. I hiked starting at 3pm and there were a good few parts in the shade as well as the sun which provided a good mix.', 'Had a great hike there, first mile or so is shaded, after that be prepared to hike exposed to direct sun. We actually camped overnight at the campsite a mile past the waterfall. Great secluded campsite just be extra careful did come across a rattle snake on side of trail...', 'i give this trail 5 stars but a little dangerous for kids .nice views! overall a beautiful trail . the only wird tging is thats the trail goes through a small town and i almost got bit by dog .', 'Great hike!', 'This was an excellent hike! The trail was easy enough for an adventurous 7 year-old, including the navigation down the rope-assisted section.

Would highly recommend as a pretty easy hike!', 'Beautiful views and a pretty decent waterfall at the end. Brought my dog who was too scared to go down the rope to the base of the falls, so we went to the top of them instead which was really nice. Be careful of snakes! We saw 3 of them (including a rattlesnake) on our way back to the car', 'Super fun! Prepare to have hiking shoes tho', 'Very beautiful and peaceful', 'Did this at 9am on Monday, April 23rd. Didn’t see anyone on trail for at least an hour. It’s decently marked. A few spots where you can lose the trail but fairly easy to figure it out. Last mile to waterfall is a good steep incline. Trail narrows but if you keep going, it widens a bit again. We almost turned back before reaching waterfall. But ran into some hikers finally who said we were close. Continued on and got great views from distance. Final descent to waterfall is almost like repelling down using a rope to hold on to. We skipped that part but still got awesome views. Falls were full. Plenty of pretty wildflowers along the way.', ""Gorgeous trail! we didn't complete the 10miles, we did 8! got as far as we could and had to turn back because it became too difficult to get through bushes and climbing over fallen trees, once u hit the waterfall at mile 2.5, I believe, it's amazing!!!"", 'Hiked here 2 days ago and it was beautiful.. so many flowers blooming and the waterfall flowing nicely! Pretty easy hike. It’s best to start early to avoid all the people. Busy trail! We started by 7:00 am and had the waterfall area to ourselves, which was great.', 'It’s a very nice place to go. ', 'Fun hike, my husband and I lost track of the distance and continued past the waterfall. It became difficult to traverse because of the overgrown plants and numerous thorn bushes.

Beware of ants !', 'one of best views and hikes that we went..really nice scenery..definitely well going back more often..the best time to go up is after the raining days..', 'A great hike, especially after a rain. The waterfall at the end makes it work trekking through the hot sun, since most of the hike is not under a canopy.', 'Started a little later than I would like and almost made it to the top of the trail where it meets Condor Peak Trail. I would’ve continued but had my doubts that there’d be a good spot to pitch a tent up there. Next time I’ll set up camp at Lucas Camp and summit in the morning. That’s probably the last chance to fill up and process water.', 'The trail has some pretty great views of the mountains a few miles in. Past the waterfall (which is beautiful by the way), the trail becomes narrower and less maintained. Around the six mile mark, it’s nearly impossible to take a backpack because of the over growth on the trails. It become a much more difficult vs. “moderate” trail. We saw around 5 sites to camp within those six miles. It’s very remote—no sounds of traffic and no sign of people. Plenty of water, as the trails followed the creek (this may change, depending on time of year). If you visit the waterfall, be careful not to get turned around. We wound back tracking and adding 2 miles to our trek back to the car. The trail to the waterfall is off the out-and-back main trail. Lots of inclines going in, mostly declines going out. No cell reception whatsoever, but the app can still track you on the trail. The only trail markers were stacked rocks that hikers made, and sometimes there were orange or pink ties on trees. **parking: we parked on the main road because the road to the trail was closed off to visiting vehicles. It was about .3 miles to the trailhead. You pass a few small houses along the road. There will be a few signs that tell you which direction for the trail.', 'This trail was awesome. It took a lot of convincing to get my girlfriend to climb along the cliff side right before the water fall but she made it lol.', ""There's hardly any water, but a great workout!"", ""We got to the trailhead around 2pm. We were able to get to the waterfall and enjoy our picnic on top overlooking the falls. There wasn't too much water coming from the falls but it was peaceful. As we were leaving the sun was setting and we got spectacular views of the mountains changing colors. We got to the car before dark. Overall a great hike!"", 'You have to climb down to get to the waterfall and was a little sketch but well worth it! We got right in the water after a hike in the intense heat. So fun!', ""Totally going back! but seriously if you're taking your dog please take care of it, there's feces half way through the beginning of the trail. not cool"", 'I have hiked this trail many times but only to the waterfall. Once, many years ago I kept going past the waterfall but as many others have pointed out, the trail disappears and it becomes very hard to navigate. Maybe with the help of Alltrails GPS, it is easier to find now.\nThe best season to experience the waterfall in all its glory would be spring time, especially after a heavy rainy season. Otherwise, you might not see water at all. \nOverall, it is an easy hike to the waterfall with the last leg being the most difficult due to the steep incline on the exposed cliff side. \nThis is a go-to hike for me since it is relatively close to the city.', 'This hike was ok. Trail was hard to follow and never made it to a waterfall.  I was bushwacking also and no luck.  Just found out that alltrails has gps offline and may go back cause this one kicked my butt.  I will reupdate my review.', 'Great trail with a gentle assent through shade and a few water crossings, great for beginner trail runners. The route to Lazy Lucas (about 3 miles) is easy to follow, if a little scratchy on the legs in a few places that the foliage is a bit thick. Great views, quiet, and lightly traveled.\n\nPast Lazy Lucas, the path is less defined and I relied on carins left by previous hikers to chart my way, and made some of my own to make sure I did not lose the track on my return trip.\n\nI was attempting to make it to the saddle and then up to Condor peak, however, the trail after Tom Lucas Camp ground (about 5 miles) is pretty much nonexistent, and the only way I knew I was still on the right path was by using All Trails GPS. This was not just bush whacking, this was full on trail blazing, and after making it about only a 1/4 mile in about 25 min. I decided to turn back.\n\nI tried to make it to Condor peak via Fox Peak previously, but was turned away by a dangerously washed out trail, but I  I am determined, Especially after seeing the peak with its distinctive shape so close on this hike. I plan to return to this route with a machete and pink marker ribbon and hack my way through to the saddle, and will be sure to update if I manage to clear I path!', ""August 19th the creek is completely dry save for a few areas where there is stagnant water. \n\nI hiked this with my boyfriend with the intention of going all the way to Tom Lucas Camp - I knew it was overgrown and the trail would be hard to find, but we wanted the trip to be  a little adventurous. \n\nWe started around 3pm. The last climb before the waterfall is pretty tough especially in the heat, but we made it and continued our way down the trail skipping the waterfall trail that forks to the right (it was dry anyway). The trail after that continues to get less and less maintained. There is poison oak everywhere - before the waterfall, you'll have no trouble with it if you can identify it and use a stick in some areas to move it out of the way. Past the falls, requires a little more intention with where you step and what you're rubbing up against. Past Lazy Lucas Camp you will need hiking pants as the trail is little better than bushwacking, although it's not too difficult to follow as there are cairns and pink ribbon on some of the trees. \n\nWe were unable to find Tom Lucas Camp even when our GPS said we were right on top of it. The brush is so thick and we were not able to see any flat area where a campsight might have been. We doubled back and ended up pitching camp at about 6pm in a sandy opening where there was evidence that others had camped there before. \n\nBe warned, the further areas of this trail are heavily infested with poison oak (we washed everything with Tecnu when we got home and I still expect for some to develop in the next couple of days). \n\nWe were completely isolated and slept in our tent without our fly - we broke camp and started back at about 7:30am. There return hike in the morning was really beautiful and nice! I'd love to go back once the creek starts flowing again."", 'Good workout and awesome views. BUT the waterfall that was so beautifully flowing a couple months back, is noe completely dry. would be a nice morning hike or sunset hike. I went at 1:00pm and the sun was excruciating,  it is way too hot to take dogs right now as well. I took my dog and I regretted it. I had to carry her most of the way.', ""This was a great hike, but if you blink, you'll miss the area where you're supposed to stop and park. Got there round 730, hike took a cpl of hours. To get to the base of the waterfall, you have to go down a cpl of slopes with less than ideal footing, but there are ropes there and they help.

Def majestic and stuff"", ""This was a great hike. Unfortunately we left late (thanks to that person) but it was great! It's a bit of an incline I promise it's not as long as you would think I saw so many people turn around and they were just around the corner from the falls so keep going!!

Was just starting to get hot when we finished."", ""This hike is everything everyone said. Gorgeous scenery. So worth the climb for some it will be harder than others but worth the push. Honestly, one of the most beautiful hikes I have ever been on in SoCal. Certainly not boring. But make sure you bring lots of water and sunscreen. Maybe even a snack/trail mix. Dipping your feet in the water after the hike and seeing the waterfall is the reward and so worth it! We have seen some small snakes, a bob cat and a rattlesnake once.

Plus, somebody stole my son's hiking pole. :-("", ""I came on 5/27 and had a great time. I was a little sad to see everyone getting a ticket when I was leaving for Parking on either side of the road.

On the side where the trail is located, there aren't any no parking signs at all. On the opposite side there are. I'm not sure if I'll be going back because I certainly don't want a parking ticket. I'm sure they're not going to be there to ticket you every time, but park at your own risk. It's a beautiful hike."", ""Nice desolate hike. Free parking and relatively easy to find. You'll cross a handful of streams, but you're going to mostly be in the sun walking up an incline. I went a little bit further than I was supposed to because there are no markers to the waterfall.

Inside was the register, a red beanie, a key fob and a pair of reading glasses. :) Happy Hiking!', 'Nice hike it took about an hour and 5 minutes to get to the waterfall from the main highway.  Great views in a lovely Canyon.', 'The waterfall is gorgeous and well worth taking the path down. We went past the waterfall up to Condor Peak and made it an 18 mile loop. Trail was overgrown north of waterfall to its junction with Condor Peak Trail. Parts were nearly impassable and we had a hard time staying on trail. Poison Oak was everywhere and I had a few ticks by the end of the trip. The views on top were great. We did have to walk the road for two miles back to the car.', 'Hard Incline with a beautiful sights. Went to waterfall and back. Will do it again.', ""I heard mixed reviews about needing an adventure pass for this trail, so I'd advise just to display one anyway. The trailhead itself is off the highway just over the hill on the dirt road. I hear sometimes the gate for the dirt road is open, but on a Monday at 10:45 am the gate was locked. So we parked at the entrance (don't block the gate because people live back there) and hiked the extra bit of road to the trailhead.It was a cool day (about 64 degrees), and we got a late start. But the sun exposure for most of this trail is intense, and it felt warm through the entire hike. Don't forget to not only bring, but reapply the sunscreen. Bring bug spray too, as the mosquitos at the beginning of the trail are everywhere.Once you pass the creek and an oak tree with a beautiful hollow in the middle (which someone's ruined by putting junk in it) the incline along the canyon wall begins. This is where it heats up. But the views are beautiful and the flowers are everywhere too.The falls are located at about the 2 mile mark, so you don't have to do all 11 miles of this trail. Just to the falls and back is a little over 4 miles (considering the closed road).You see the falls from a distance before you reach them. There is an obvious trail that splits to the right to reach the base of the falls. It's a little steep and rocky at one point, so don't be afraid to get on your butt and test which roots and rocks you use as leverage. I brought my 53 lbs shepherd mix dog with me and he made it down and up no problem.At this point we turned around and went back. I've heard you can go further up the trail which will split to the right again and lead you to the creek, which you can walk down to reach the top of the falls. Also, you can continue on to do the entire 11 plus mile trail. More power to those who do.Be sure to watch out for snakes while you're hiking. We saw a beautiful racer snake, but it was the juvenile rattlesnake that my cousin almost stepped on that got our attention. She was paying attention to where she stepped too, except for that two seconds I distracted her. Luckily our trusty snake stick (walking stick really) helped moved the little guy on before he decided to strike at the foot she had frozen in the air at the horrified scream of terror from me when I saw the debacle about to happen.

I loved it and hope you do too!"", 'Este Camino esta muy relajante', 'very nice hike for late morning.', 'Great trail, really liked it. Waterfall is about 2 miles into the trail. Only did the waterfall and back about 4 mi. total. Recommended to all for a short hike with a nice reward.

We started around 8:30 and missed most of the people, but as we were coming back noticed a very high volume of hikers.', ""Really nice trail, the waterfall is beautiful I try to go to the end of the period, the one choke on the map, but I couldn't go through it was no maintenance,trail,but I come back and I went to the waterfall. Be careful for the rattlesnake they are out."", 'Awesome trail with lots of running water and wild flowers :)', 'This trail kicked my butt, in a good way. :)', '', 'Loved it!', 'Great hike, and the waterfall amazing !', ""Most things in a big city, especially famous landmarks or parks gets over crowded and filled with people. It's hard to find something tranquil, sparse, and serene, Trail Canyon Falls has become my sanctuary, a place to get away. It's hard to even find the trail head to this place and much of the trail still has damage left over from a forest fire a few years back. But it is gorgeous, peaceful, with some challenging bits here or there as you walk along side the canyon up to the falls. There is also more hiking even past the falls as well, as you go deeper into the forest, you can't help but feel the noise of city feels far, far away.(Notes/Tips: Families with small children may need to mind their kids further in the hike. The trail does narrow to fit only one or two people at a time and, as your going up, the canyon does have some deep drops with no saftey railings. Mind your kids especially around the waterfall as well, as the trail splits both going up to the top of the waterfall [right up the edge] and at the base of it.)"", 'Important question please! Would the hike to the falls and back be acceptable for a child? Will be visiting California soon with my daughter and I am trying to decide if I should go here or not.', ""Awesome hike, I only went out to the falls and back (about 3.75 miles total).  I brought my new DJI Mavic Pro drone with me to get some great footage of the (currently well-flowing) waterfall.  You might be able to find it if you search on youtube.  Be warned that there's about 8-10 river crossings, some more treacherous than others, most have wobbly logs, but you should probably expect to get some wet feet.  Bring an extra pair of socks for the drive home."", ""I loved this trail, I wasn't expecting it to be as awesome as it was.. Definitely Coming Back!!!"", 'Gate to trailhead will be closed so plan on parking along the road. Please be respectful of those who live in the canyon. Travel quietly and pack out everything you pack in. That includes your orange peels and cigarette butts. The falls were roaring when I went 2/24/17. Expect to cross the creek several times before the last incline. Watch out for poison oak and rocks/logs in the creek that will move as you try to cross on them. Beautiful views! Such a special place.', 'Great trail overall but be warned you will have to cross several rushing rivers by walking across not so big logs.  Also beware of ticks as I did find one on me after hiking the trail.  Will definitely be back soon as the rainy weather is perfect for optimal waterfall experience.', 'It was beautiful full Falls so cold air that we seen Mother Nature so green', ""This was a great hike. We went to the bottom of the falls as well as the top.

This trail is nice and short, great for a day hike. When you get the top of the builders it may seem like there is no way down but there is a rope that helps you down. I'd suggest to get here early because it get super crowded; the trail near the builders is narrow so it becomes a hassle with a lot of people, not to mention the parking."", 'This was a beautiful trail, for sure. The farther up the trail, the more obstructions you have to watch out for, though. If all you want to see is the impressive waterfall, then your hike in will be pretty short, but be prepared to climb down some pretty steep cliffsides if you want more than a distant view. Once you pass the falls, the trail gets progressively more difficult to recognize and traverse. There are a bunch of fallen trees blocking the path. We were not able to complete it. We were short by about 1 mile as it was no longer safe to continue. It was great exploring, though.', ""LOVE LOVE LOVE this hike!  Visited yesterday for the very first time and though it was a bit harder and longer than anticipated, it was fantastic.  Some helpful advice:  wear waterproof shoes or boots as you'll cross several creeks and balance on rocks / logs to get across.  Pack lots of water, snacks, sunscreen, sunglasses and a hat - the sun can be brutal and while hiking up to the fall, it's really hot and not much shade at all. Parking - there's a small dirt lot directly off of the main road but if it's full, parking is fine on the side of the road.  Walk up and stay to the right.  The path to the left goes up quite a ways with beautiful views of the city but no waterfall. There is some climbing involved in order to get down to the fall  but it is well worth it.  Overall - a fantastic hike of over 7 miles."", ""Okay here is how to get to this Glorious Hidden location.... Use the AllTrails app for GPS directions. You're basically going up Big Tujunga Canyon Rd. in Sunland. Until mile marker 2.0. Then park along that gate on the left side of the Road or drive down the road for a parking lot in case it is full.From the Road to the Falls and back it's 6 miles. That mile and a half to the Falls is all uphill and brutal. I literally wanted to quit like 5 times. Then again I am a beginning hiker. To get to the Falls itself you will literally have to do some rock climbing. So wear good traction shoes. You will do about 10 water crossing. So expect to get wet and be able to walk across logs and hop rocks. This is not an easy Trail but worth the Waterfall at the end.I was dying, luckily my hiking bestie offered to carry my pack while walking uphill. She literally carried my pack for me for parts of the Trail because I just wanted to cry, I was so tired. Okay maybe that's a little dramatic but it's true. Maybe the distance was part of it as well, but this Trail was by Far the hardest Trail I have done. Have fun.The water is seasonal and mostly dry, so get here and see these amazing falls before its gone."", ""The waterfall is beautiful! Pack a lot of water and snacks. Please NO LITTERING! The hike is amazing if you like a far walk and a challenge this is it! Farther up the canyon are rocky and narrow trails. Part shade and part sun. We are used to the hard, rough hikes but for beginners it will be rough getting down to the waterfall but it's well worth it."", 'We hiked this trail in January after the rain. The waterfall was absolutely gorgeous. There is a pretty good scramble to get down to the falls which is totally worth it. Overall, the trail is pretty easy. I did it with my infant strapped to my back in a baby carrier pack. There is not a lot of shade and it can be quite warm. Make sure to pack enough water and sunscreen. The other high point is the views of the canyon. The canyon walls are fairly steep, especially as you get towards the falls. Several of the views are quite spectacular.', 'The trail disappears a lot because the water has dried up completely and often looks like part of the trail-- just be warned. Not even close to my favorite LA hike.', ""This is a moderate canyon hike that feels a lot more secluded than it really is. The waterfall was completely dried up in August, though. I bet it looks great when there's some water running through it. However, the views of the canyon and surrounding mountains made this hike worthwhile despite the lack of water. This trail barely any shade, so if you're going on a hot day, make sure to bring a hat and lot of water."", 'easy hike with beautiful views', 'This is a nice trail. I definitely recommend you wear pants here.if you go on a sunny day take a hat, sunblock and plenty of water..along the way there are pretty neat resting stops along side of the trail under shade.', 'This is tale of two Hikes, to the Falls and then beyond the falls.\nI went as far as i cold until the Trail is gone. and that is 4.5 miles from the trail head. the 1st mile after the falls is definitely worth it and is still on the easy side and easy to follow, then it gets tough, got to focus on staying on the ""trail"" lots of cairns and other markers to assist you but still tough. and at times you are beating back bushes crawling under and over logs, You can tell before the Fire, it was one spectacular place, it still is pretty special, but a lot of work, be prepared and be experienced the last mile or so.\nYOU MUST wear long pants if going beyond the falls.\nTo the Falls is fairly easy, IF ITS not Hot, There was a good bit of water for me today, but the trail to the bottom of the Falls is Tough you will need BOTH hands up and down this short section of Trail/rock-climbing.\n\nNot many people for being a GREAT trail from start to finish.\nI will return, which is not something i say for MOST trails in the L.A. Area', ""Mostly uphill in the beginning which wraps around the side of the ridge. Pretty narrow walk, so hope you're not afraid of heights. The walk down to the waterfall is pretty steep so watch your step and take your time. It was pretty dry at the bottom but the upside was that we were able to get under the waterfall to cool down. There's more trail to cover if you continue passed the fall, but we ended up calling it quits about a mile of not coming to anything substantial. I'd like to come back and finish it off. Great hike! Probably be better in the early morning or early evening."", 'was a fun hike up to the fall, but there was no water so kinda bummed us out. other then the water problem it was a beautiful day to hike and enjoy the scenery .', ""We were here to chase a waterfall during the drought. How very unfortunate that it was completely dry. Being new to hiking, I would not consider this as an easy hike, mainly due to the trail being very narrow. It is frightening for individuals like me who are scared of heights, and yet pursue hiking. \nWithout my group, I would have headed back. \nThere is absolutely no phone service in the area, so you cannot make any calls during an emergency. This is not recommended for solo beginner hikers like me. Try this with a group, and when there's a waterfall."", 'My fiance and I hiked this trail about 2 months ago. We didnt know when exactly we were going to reach the falls. Eventually , after hiking up for a bit and going around a mountain ridge, we saw the small but pretty falls.', 'First of all, not Easy as All Trails described.  Very beautiful landscapes, trail crosses dry creek bed several times. we went about halfway then back due to sunset coming. We did see where the water fall was, although dried up in early August when we went. Best time for this trail is morning...there are a few spots with full sun.  Sunscreen and water is a must. Stunning views, lots of color, late afternoon great for pictures.', ""There's a large bee hive in the hollowed out tree that is right next to the path. I definitely got stung by a bee (on my head no less). I could have done without the bee sting."", ""It would've been nicer if there was shade during the hike to the falls but there were none the entire hour hike to get to a dried up waterfall. There were very tiny running water creeks here and there. On the way back we saw 2 rattlesnakes within ten feet of each other."", ""Awesome trail the only thing is it's not a easy trail as described in the app. Still very georgious. Go in the morning when it's not hot. The inclined part of the trail is full sun exposure. All in all I will definitely be back."", 'My wife and I went on this hiked and enjoyed it . Pet friendly. It took us about 3 hours and that includes a few stops . Multiple mini trails that may confuse you .. But there is one main trail :) went down to the waterfall and went a little beyond the fall and was still beautiful . We are definitely coming back', ""I ran this trail yesterday, Sunday March 29th 2015...  Absolutely stunning, there's wild flowers galore, the trails are very well kept, clean and easy to move efficiently and safely!  It is a very easy and short ( 4 miles round trip) hike or run to the waterfall!  The only problem is keeping an eye for the dirt road that takes you to the parking spot, it's easy to miss as it has no sign.  The shades of green are luscious and the views of the canyon while on the trails are stunning!  There's an abundance of wild roses at the base of the fall and the rock formation and coloration of the fall couldn't be scrip any better!  A must do!"", 'Did this hike with several of my friends and a dog. The weather was beyond perfect and we reached the falls after an hour or so. Spent about an hour at the top and bottom of the falls taking pictures, resting & snacking before heading back. All-in-all it was about 5 miles round-trip which included a little detour we took  hiking in that led us to a few burned out houses from the fire that swept the area 5 years ago.\n\nDef recommend for anyone looking to get out for the day.', 'The hike up to the falls is awesome and worth the trek. The trail will take you all the way to Tom Lucas Camp and Condor Peak. This is no easy stroll in the park and make sure you take the 10 essentials.Check out my video for Trail Canyon Falls and some other videos that I posted of my adventures. \n\n\nSubscribe and Like - \nTrail Canyon Falls - \nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=VbOzfGQsUsU', ""Went yesterday (4/22/14). There was no sign for the dirt road to the left off of Big Tujunga Canyon Rd. so keep an eye out for it. It's only 2 miles to the falls. from the trailhead. The trail takes you to the top of the falls, but there is a small trail that leads down to the bottom right before you approach it. We went past the falls for an hour to find a camp. We came across two small makeshift campsites, but I'm not sure if we ever made it to the Tom Lucas Trail Camp. The trail began to get increasingly covered in poison oak and more overgrown plants."", ""As mentioned before, the trail has been re-opened. It's an enjoyable hike, fairly easy but still interesting with a number of spots where you could easily lose the trail (and just as easily find it again). I thought the best part of the hike was past the waterfall, toward Tom Lucas Trail Camp. There are beautiful sections of the valley where burnt oak trees are sprouting leaves again and plant life is rebuilding. Past the camp, the trail continues a bit further, sparsely marked with red ribbons, but it's difficult to follow and offers little reward (just lots of cuts from overgrown brush). I recommend hiking to the camp, snacking, and heading back with a stop at the top of the waterfalls."", ""(Trail is open). \n\nJust completed this trail for the third time. There's a sign past the first few cabins saying that the trail is not maintained; however,  I would be inclined to believe otherwise by the state of it -seems in good condition to me! \n\nAt first, the trail follows along a road. Eventually, this road turns (if you continue along it you'll see abandoned equipment and other misc. 'stuff'). You may be led to think that the trail does as well but instead it follows along the creak to the right.I highly enjoy this part of the trail. Its partially shaded, close to the water, and is low but your feet keep active hopping rocks and walking logs.  You'll be making several creek crossings that you can miss the trail on occassion but I've never had any trouble quickly finding it again. You'll make a final creek crossing before making your way up. Here the trail has a few wash outs. Yet, these are easy to pass, even for someone like myself who admittingly is not as sure on her feet as she liked to be. After a bend, you'll be able to see the waterfall. Now, getting closer, you might notice that there are two paths to the waterfall. One upper and one lower. Both involve somewhat of a scramble and both are equally as enjoyable. \n\nBut you may also continue. the 1.5 miles described is to the falls but the trail continues past. There are actually two possibilities but the more visiable follows further into the canyon. A trickier one to find goes upward - again a scramble, and a switchbacking scramble - but one with a great view of where you've just been. I've done both, today taking the lower path. This lower path is marked with both ducks and red ribbon markers. We stopped eventually after an addition hour past the falls although the trail did not. \n\nI enjoy this hike enough to keep coming back - has a good combination of scenery, variety, and easy - moderate level of difficulty."", 'I went two weeks ago & it closed due to fires. very disappointed', 'Trail Canyon Falls is one of the best waterfalls in southern California.After a few good rains it looks like a waterfall in Yosemite. Not as tall though...lol. The trail was great but after the fire it has been beat up pretty bad. There are a few washoutson the dirt road.Once you reach the stream part of the hike the trail is gone...just a use trail now. after you start climbing out of the canyon the trail is there as it was

The trail itself wasn't terribly challenging, but the higher elevation made breathing a little more of a struggle. Fantastic hike to start off your day, with great views of the lakes below and Crystal Lake did not disappoint.

My Garmin 5X Plus  had me at 10,759 feet above sea level at the highest, so the elevation makes this a moderate hike for sure. I ran into several people that turned around.

Lots of switchbacks and shade help the trip up until you descend down to beautiful Crystal lake.  Nice views of lake George and lake Mary from above.  Great hike that will get your heart pumping.', 'Fairly easy to do! Took less than 2 hours to do with my dog but added an extra hour to hang out by the lake and walk around it. It can get crowded so prepare for lots of people but otherwise a beautiful hike!', 'Great easy hike in winter. Having cross country skis to get from the road closure to the trailhead would be helpful, but you can also walk the couple miles to the start.', 'So easy a fat guy can do it. The hike up is a near constant incline but not very steep. With frequent breaks we made it to the lake with our 7 year old, 15 year old, and 2 adults. The lake itself is very pretty and we enjoyed resting our legs by the water and eating some snacks before making our way back down.', 'Maybe I was having an ""off"" hike. I found this trail to be very difficult to follow. I got to a point of the trail where the only option to go would have been to scale a very sandy and steep hill, I would\'ve taken that route had I not been with my 60 lb dog. If that was the true route to go, I would not call this trail a dog-safe trail. Unfortunately we had to turn around.', 'Short, but steep hike to a very pleasant lake.  I would rate this as hard due to the steep grade.  The lake itself is wonderful - a lot of people were swimming in the lake during my visit.', 'Amazing Views of Lake Mary, Lake George and at the end the lovely Lake Crystal.This is a moderate hike with some great elevations, so if you are a beginner then consider this a hard hike ( not for distance , but only because of elevation and lots of curves )', 'Great views and very relaxing once at the lake', ""Beautiful hike. Moderate but challenging because of the altitude. A little smokey at the beginning because of the fires, but cleared up before we got to Crystal Lake. Cool, clear water with a few people jumping off rocks into it. Saw a few people with fishing poles too and they all said they weren't having any luck. Seemed to take about an hour and 15 minutes to get up there. This was with many stops and a really slow pace."", 'Great hike, very beautiful.', 'Beautiful!!', 'We did this with a group of about 20 friends ranging from 50 to 5 years of age all of us in different levels of fitness.  It’s not as easy as Devils Postpile but it’s beautiful.  The trails are steep and if your not used to the elevation can make it that much more challenging.  We packed up a few poles in hopes to get a golden trout and a few brought swim wear.  It was amazing but for a 38 y.o. Who does light waking a few times a week I was winded but my camelbak was my best friend and Motrin was my best friend the next day.  Enjoy!!', 'FIVE STARS FIVE STARS!! The lake is absolutely stunning and the hike was very easy/moderate. It is also dog friendly so I would pack your pup, a lunch, and maybe even a couple beers and soak in the view for a while when you get up there! Gorgeous!', 'On our first afternoon camping at Lake Mary, we ventured up the trail to Crystal Lake. With hiking and meandering around the lake, we logged about five miles. The trail to the lake and back is shorter but a steep climb. The views of the Mammoth Lakes are increasingly rewarding the higher you go, especially at the crest when veering left before approaching the lake. Crystal Lake is pristine and worth the light hike around it, too. There was an abundance of wildflowers blooming, especially on the south end of the lake.', 'Harder for less experienced hikers, elevation gain can be intense. Took our two year old up in a carry pack and it was well worth the views! Beautiful views of George, Mary and a glimpse of Horseshoe Lake along the way. We found a spot on the rocks and the water was ice cold- perfect after the hike! My toddler loved eating her lunch here and then wading in the water. Worth it.', 'Took my 2 daughters, 9 and 10, and they were troopers and hiked up to Crystal Lake. We started around 1, took some rests, ate a snack at the lake, heard some thunder and watched some lightning on the way down, and it took us about 2 hours. If you go on a summer afternoon be prepared for thunderstorms! But it was a pretty hike, nice lake views along the way, and a beautiful destination.', 'Great short hike with fantastic views. Lots of shaded areas to rest. Bring your swimsuit for the end!', 'Awesome hike up to a gorgeous lake. It is steep uphill but downhill is a breeze!', 'Great hike....loved it but very steep, what a beautiful lake and a small stream on the back side of the lake! Lots of bugs and warm this time of year...', 'Incredible views with a stunning lake at the end, very worth the hike.', 'Great views! The trail was exactly what the description said.', 'If you are looking for a short scenic hike in the mammoth lakes area. This is a great choice. The views as you climb over the lakes are beautiful. Actually I feel the views on the way up are more impressive than Crystal Lake itself. It was about a 2 hour round trip for us and my girlfriend is not really a hiker. However it is a constant climb on the way to the lake. Like most hikes early morning is always the best time in the summer. No people and the light on the lake and mountains is amazing.', 'Great hike today with the family and a hundred of our closest friends! (4 star rating is just because it was crowded).  Trail is easy to follow (no more snow), and cutting the switchbacks is not necessary. The trail is well-graded, never flat but never to steep either. Lake is beautiful and the swim was perfect. Enjoy!', 'Crystal Lake Trail is a moderately challenging hike with beautiful vistas and panoramic views of Lakes Mary and George below.', 'Absolutely stunning view of the lakes.', 'Fast easy hike.. saw too many people going off trail due to the snow (please don’t do that, it ruins the hike). Decided to turn around and wait for the snow to melt. Snow should be gone by July 4th', 'One of the prettiest alpine lakes with minimal effort to get there. Cool view of lake George and lake Mary from above. Watching climbers on crystal crag was an unexpected bonus.', 'Amazing beautiful hike', 'Amazing hike, snow got us lost but when arrived to crystal lake the view was beautiful', ""Alpine lakes, shade, and a great view of the basin; what more do you need?The trail does get unclear due to snow and runoff, but at now point is is dangerous or precarious. If you're unsure of the trail due to snow, or unclear demarcations then I'd suggest looking up hill a bit and seeing where the trail head continues and ladder up. You'll reconnect with the trail after 10-20 feet or so. Amazing."", ""Caution: The late-season snowpack has made this trail significantly more difficult and treacherous than would be typical. \n\nI went up on Memorial Day weekend and the trail disappears into the snow approx. 25-30% of the way up. The official trail that leads to the junction with the Mammoth Crest Trail is completely snowbound and demarcation appears absent. The granite crest that divides the lake basin from the preceding climb has less snow cover, owing to decreased tree cover, but large drifts prevail once again around Crystal Lake.\n\nCrystal Lake is about 90-95% frozen over.\n\nThe snowfields cover multiple areas of steep ascent that is passable, but one should seriously evaluate equipment, fitness, and Alpine experience before continuing up into the snow-covered terrain. The snow is navigable in waterproof hiking boots and with sturdy trekking poles, but studded footwear or snowshoes would still be helpful even this late into the season. Going up is strenuous, but the descent can be very dangerous. Absent a clear trail, many are descending across snowfields over steep slopes. The snow becomes slick as the day progresses, so special care should be practiced at the upper descent.\n\nI don't regret this hike, and the very and relative solitude was marvelous. But it was far more difficult that I had initially planned, and I had to be mindful to stay within my limits. Once the snow melts and the trails crews can access the terrain, I expect the conditions to improve drastically. For now, tread very carefully."", 'MUST have proper hiking shoes, poles and micro spikes!!! Tons of snow, it’s doable but only enjoyable with these pieces. We are avid hikers and had to turn around from the snow fields.', 'Amazing Hiking and swimming', 'This place is breathtaking. Seems almost unreal. I will come back again and again - hiked in October of ‘17', 'Hike is so worth the constant switchbacks (which did seem like forever but it ends I swear!)', 'Very nice hike thru woods, the incline is a little tough for beginners a lot of switchbacks but just keep going the views of the lakes are magnificent it’ll be well worth it.', 'very cool to see snow in September. beautiful scenery all the way up to the gorgeous lake. go early for maximum tranquility.', 'Great trail, beautiful in late September with light snow blanketing the mountain. It’s about 5 miles round trip so bring snacks and plenty of water!', ""Love this trail. The altitude was trying to keep me away but I went really slow and drank lots of water and man was it worth it. Incredible and named appropriately this lake is. Beautiful redwoods and gorgeous views of Lake George and Lake Mary and of course Crystal Lake. You find a sign for Mammoth Crest Trail once you've just about reached the top of the climb to Crystal Lake. Small decent to the lake note: it may be easy for some people to lose the trail here especially if the altitude is effecting you poorly... so watch your step."", 'a big climb at the beginning but getting to the top was well worth it.', 'A hidden gem after a moderate 1.2 mile walk.', ""Great hike for kids and dogs with beautiful views of lakes George and Mary as well as the back of the Sherwin's."", ""My wife and I took our 3 and 5 year old kids up on this hike.

Such a great hike.', 'So amazingly beautiful. My 2 dachshunds loved it. It is so worth the climb. Looking down on lake George and lake Mary are spectacular.', 'Great for early hiking.', ""Trail climbs steadily until it drops just before the lake. Great views of the surrounding area including falls coming from Crystal Lake. Wasn't as crowded as the McLeod Lake trail-head"", 'Absolutely stunning lake!! If you plan on going... go early!! It was very peaceful for most of the time we were there! Then all the sudden it became very crowded, not just crowded but crowded with loud obnoxious people!! People with Bluetooth speakers going and yelling from one end of the lake to the other!!But the lake is absolutely beautiful!! You can see the fish swimming!! We were there early and only caught one, but you can see them jumping!! Maybe flying would work best up there!!The trail is short-ish, I am out of shape and I made it! There is still snow up there!! The switchbacks are ""good"" I mean as far as switchbacks go! The views are absolutely stunning along the way!!Oh yeah... mosquitoes are out in full force!! Unless you wanna be eaten alive bring the spray!!', 'Uphill climb was tough in the altitude, but the views were worth the pain!', ""A beautiful hike offering a bird's eye view of the lakes basin and surrounding snowy mountains. It was short but the climb in high altitude can offer a challenge for some. Bring hiking poles if you have. There are some patches of snow but not many. A good portion of the hike was shaded. Crystal Lake offers a stunning view with the reflection of mountains and sky in the lake. Be careful if you step on the logs; some are not stable and you can possibly fall. This hike has made my short list of favorites!"", ""I took this hike with the intention of just going to Crystal Lake, which is a beautiful lake, but I was enjoying it so much I continued on to Mammoth Crest. Once I reached Mammoth Crest I saw the trail continuing on and as often happens to me I had to continue on to see what was around the next bend. The views are spectacular and you feel like you're at the top of the world. I have bad knees so coming down was slow and painful for me but still enjoyed the experience."", 'Beautiful views from the trail, small patches of snow along trail but could easily avoid them.  Trail was very easy to follow.  The view at the lake was incredible...well worth the hike and effort of climbing uphill.', 'Took a while to get there. Was pretty Cold up there but felt great.', 'Some of the best views in the sierras. Can see multiple lakes at the pinnacle before the descent to clear lake. Highly recommended.', 'Snow everywhere, some of the trail was hard to find  in places but so worth it.', ""Awesome hike but the trail was poorly marked in areas. I'm an amateur but thought this was an amazing end to a challenging day."", 'The trail is almost impossible to follow, but with the help of Alltrails offline map, we found the lake.  The snow covers parts of the trail near the top.  This is a short trail, but you are climbing over a 9700 foot ridge, so it is not an easy hike ... but the views are worth the effort.  This is one beautiful little lake.', 'Pretty hike! Some snow was covering some of the trail- so we just winged it. Not that hard of a hike... our dog loved the snow and water...', ""Added another mile to this hike as we parked at the top of the waterfall of Twin Lakes. The trail wasn't as busy as we expected it to be. The weather was a bit chilly especially on this trail when most of it is under the canopy of trees. I should have brought a sweater! The plan was to wade across Crystal Lake to the small island to grab a geocache. Half way there, as the water reached the Cardenas jewels, I retreated back to the mainland! The hike wasn't too bad but I wished I had brought my trekking poles for this one. Great views of George's Lake from the trail. It's a must to return!"", 'The first 1.5 miles are very easy, but you gain some serious altitude over the past mile.  Great views as you climb.  The trail is tough to find as you climb, but if you stick to the ridge you will run right into Crystal Lake.', 'My family did this hike yesterday ....the views at top of trail were absolutely beautiful. Could see all the way to twin lakes.We had a VERY difficult time on this hike....there is a lot of snow covering the trail. So we had to do a lot of vertical climbing. Definitely felt like we climbed more than 800 feet!! The views were definitely worth the strenuous hike and many falls in the icy snow.', 'Not an incredibly difficult trail with very high payout in terms of views.', 'I agree with the comment about the snow.  You could not find the trail in spots and ended making it more of a challenge but the views were worth it', 'July 2017. Lots of snow and trail was difficult to find in some spots. This is a steep, strenuous trek but SO WORTH IT! The views were incredible. I was hiking in just some Reebok cross-trainers and I did just fine trekking through the snow. So much beautiful water runoff with all the snow melting.', 'As of Jul 1, this trail is STILL snowed in.', 'Early June 2017. Trail finding was very difficult with the snow. Have a handy electric trail guide w extra power to find your way. Could of used crampons, but a gortex boot was fine. Crystal is lake mostly frozen over now. Trail is short but a lot of work with its steep snowy incline.', ""Short but beautiful trail. I haven't went on a bad hike in this area at all. Caught a beautiful sunrise."", ""Only a serious novice would find this challenging due to well placed switchbacks and gentle grade. Trail provides good views of the valley and of Crystal Crag. With snow on the ground you rely on tread from previous hikers, but the trail is decently used so we didn't have trouble navigating. Starts with full sun exposure then heads into the trees before being exposed again near the peak. Excellent hike with a dog that likes to run and explore. Nov 24/2016."", 'Moderately challenging hike for novices but with plenty of overlooks to stop at. And the payoff at the end is so worth it. The lake surrounded by mountains lets you forget about whatever world you left at the base.

I had the whole lake to myself...almost. Quite & peaceful none the less.', ""Hiked this trail yesterday, the views of surrounding lakes on the way up was amazing.  The serenity and beauty of Crystal lake make the uphill well worth the hike.  Leave time to explore the lake area when you get up there.

Not too hard.', 'Hike up was a steady incline but not hard.  Views were awesome and we were early enough that we got to see two eagle hunting Lake George.  Rating a three due to crowds..On way up there was only a group of two in front and behind.  Coming back at about 10:30 we ran into a solid stream of hikers making their way up.

Very friendly.', 'Uphill effort but enough switchbacks. Beautiful views. Worth the short hikr', 'Great hike, beautiful views, not too far of a hike.', ""Great hike with some awesome views.  Moderate difficulty due to elevation but a definite must.

The further you hike on the trail, the better the views are of Mary and George Lakes below. This hike, and the area in general, reminds me a lot of the Rockies in Colorado. High usage trail, lots of hikers, kids, dogs, etc.', 'We took up an infant (in a pack), a 4 and 6 year old today and had a great time! The gradient was pretty mild and the trail conditions right now are VERY tame. With the lack of moisture this year, the trail is very dry, though a few snow patches still cross the path. \n\nThe way this trail was put in, the grade is pretty benign.

Reminded me a lot of the good amount of time I\'ve spent in Rocky Mountain National Park.', 'This was a really nice trail.  Super quick and steep to get to lake.  We decided to go further and get up on the crag.  Passed a good span of rocks to boulder over and ended up getting to some more technical climbing.  Great views.

Amazing views of Lake George and Lake Mary once you reach the top of the trail.', ""I remember the first time I hiked this trail, I hadn't hiked anything else at Mammoth, and when I got back, my legs were really tired. That will teach me to get in shape!  I recommend this hike to anyone with good health--from families with kids and dogs to elderly folks. It's a very popular hike but does have lots of switchbacks and a healthy increase in elevation. It takes some work! The payoff is tremendous in the views and the lake at the top. Pack a good lunch, some water, and sun block and enjoy!!!! And enjoy the stamina you're building by pushing yourself up this mountain! Your legs and butt will love you."", ""This is one of my favorite hikes in the Mammoth Lakes area. Its really a really simple hike with amazing views of the lakes basin (Lake George and Lake Mary) and the Lake George - Crystal Lake Waterfall on the way up. Crystal Lake itself is a beautiful lake with very clear water and with incredibly beautiful surrounding scenery. You can also hike around the lake and explore the meadow behind it (Great Camping spot!).\n\nWhen we hiked it we went at around 6:30 PM and reached the lake at around 7:20 PM and apart from a few people hiking back down from the lake, there was no one there! Very relaxing to go in the late afternoon.  \n\nThough its a simple beginners trail the entire hike is basically uphill (switchbacks) so its great stamina training if you're looking to build up to bigger and longer hikes. \n\nAll in all great hike that everyone needs to do at least once!"", 'Moderate short hike.

It is really starting to look dried out since there was so little rain this winter. An enjoyable hike. Not a lot of people or bikes on the trail but it was a weekday.', 'Intense but super fun! Best one in OC so far.', 'Man was this a work out. We chose to counter-clockwise and ascend the BFI. That was a challenge, but once we got past that it was a relatively moderate hike. Unfortunately, we didn’t get much rain this winter, so it was a little on the dry side, but the wild flowers were blooming, and the rest of the scenery was still nice (can’t beat those views of the coast). We did encounter a rattlesnake on fence-line trail, but it never got close enough to be a threat. Would definitely do again, preferably after it rains', 'great hike right next the coast.', 'This was a great hike today especially after the rain.. If your looking to get a great workout in with some strenuous hills and open trails then this is the one to do.  I actually used Strava to range the hike and it came out to to just over 9.5 miles.  If you do the whole loop like I did then you will be very satisfied with it especially when the day is nice and it makes for great pictures when your along the PCH ridges.. El Moro Loop has some great views that overlook the ocean and you get some fresh air for sure.. The trail was very quite and peaceful, so if your looking to get away and decompress then this would be ideal.  I will definitely do this trail again and maybe get a trail run the next time around!', 'So beautiful! Surprisingly steep areas, it takes a little practice not getting deviated on the paths.

I mainly went with full gear to train for the Trans Catalina trail.  Of the three campgrounds, I will only stay at one, the Lower Morro.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is super busy.  There are constant people and bikes; when I hike, I prefer a little more quiet.  The location is beautiful though."", ""This was definitely a good trail to experience. The level of difficulty should not be underestimated, however, I feel the challenge aspect depends on which trail you plan on hiking. They offer a map with the level of difficulty for the trail based on how long of a hike you plan on attempting. My friends and I chose the most difficult one and it was definitely 10 miles. We enjoyed the different change of scenery throughout the hike and being close to the beach kept a nice breeze on us for the day. It's a great trail!"", ""Finished this one earlier today. I didn't have time to do the whole perimeter but there are several options to shorten the hike if necessary.  It was hot and there's really no shade so be prepared for that. Also be prepared for quick steep climbs followed by long flat stretches. I recommend finishing the hike with a walk along the beach... Especially on a hot day. I wish I brought my bathing suit and a towel because the water looked very welcoming after sweating all day."", ""Note to self: Come earlier, before the heat. Bring more water, electrolytes. If you are not an avid hiker in moderate shape plan on spending over 3 hours on this trail. (9.3 miles). It's also a really fun way to get in shape while enjoying the outdoors.

I did once of down the other side of the trail (from the starting point rather following the 73, I went right and followed the trail by houses) I walked 3 miles down and turned around.  There were several tough hills on that side both going out toward the ocean and coming back. Not lots but several.

There was a good amount  of people for the time we went (nice people) and some people on bikes. Be mindful of the horse droppings as they are all over the trials.', '', 'Beautiful and easy trails. But we were disappointed that we couldn’t get to Malibu Lake at the end.. you can’t even see the lake and you can’t access it. Bummer! Along the whole trail there are many spots where you can smell the sewer. So much for a walk in nature with good smells.. the MASH site is pretty cool. Worth the effort. We still enjoyed it after all and will do it again.', 'The kids and I love hiking here!', ""Parking is 12 dollars. Some people park on Mulholland Dr and walk in to avoid the fee. This trail scales closer to easy. There's no dramatic inclines or excessive rough terrain. Family friendly! Pretty straight forward with on and off shading. Century Lake was my favorite point of interest. The 50 ft dam can be accessed with some easy trespassing, but there's no safe way to get to the base of the dam.The set of M*A*S*H is half way through the hike.Unfortunately the ending is rather lackluster as you are dropped off on the tip of Malibu Lake which is gated off completely. No point to the end other than to reach it."", 'Cool hike. Starts off pretty easy, and then gets a little more fun. We took our 5 and 7 year olds, and they enjoyed it, too.

But I was there last week post rain storms and a majority of it was impassable due to the water.', 'If anyone went to this trail today (2/25) can you please post an update on the condition of the trails\n\nThanks', ""Malibu State CreekSo we attempted to Hike the M.A.S.H site at Malibu Creek State Park but with the storm we had it completely washed out the trail. So we were unable to access it. The Trail leading up to the bridge is a puddle. Just to cross the bridge you had to go over several fallen trees. To cross to the other side of the bridge you have to cross a steam knee high and along the rest of the way you will have to walk through water. We went as far as the caves that are on the left of the trail and couldn't go any further unless we were willing to walk through waist deep in water.We did get to visit the Dam and explore other areas of the park. It's definitely one of those places you can go back to and hike several trails. We got there before it opened, so we just bought our parking pass through the parking machine which is $12. If you want to avoid the cost, you can park on Mulholland and walk in. I also bought the park map on the way out, which was $2. So next time I return we can explore new trails."", 'The whole park is gorgeous. This is a relatively mellow hike with lots of photogenic scenery.', 'A nice local hike and not too tough for the kids. Beautiful scenery and the creek seems to have more water that normal given the recents rains. A very nice family hike.', 'Beautiful scenery', 'Great park to explore.  It costs $12 for a day pass and extra for a park map.  I came on a Saturday late morning and hiked by myself.  The park and trails were moderately populated - just enough to make you feel safe, but not crowded.  The trails were pretty well marked.  I explored all around - to the M.A.S.H. Set, century lake, rock pools and Reagan ranch.  I was able to do this in less than 3 hours as I mixed hiking with some trail rubbing.  The hike is pretty moderate, though there is some good terrain to do hill sprints.  Also good hike to do as a group as the trails are pretty wide.  Also saw a handful of mountain bikers.', ""Easy long hike with a very nice view all through out.. MASH site is there too.. mostly shades and there's a lot of dears and blue birds.. creek is a little dried up right now.. but all in all i was satisfied with the hike"", ""I haven't been here since the big drought, so it was a real disappointment to see so many shades of death along the trail.  It appeared that all the trees were dry and bare, the riparian landscape was muted and bleak.  It's not the place I remembered, but the hike was easy and light.  The MASH film site was in good order!  I would warn you that the hike is a bit anticlimactic as it dead ends at a chain link fence without a view of the Malibu dam.  As far as wildlife goes, we saw a few turtles in the stagnant ponds along the creek, but few other signs of life.  If you're coming expecting the same old Malibu Creek, I would suggest waiting until Spring."", ""There is a small creek resivoir which is accessible but the Malibu lake is actually a closed private community so you can't even get there and they fail to mention that. After 3 miles of hiking we found out that we can't even get there."", 'Great trail', 'I like this hiking trail , but the lake water was not clean!', ""It's a nice place to go hike"", 'It was ok,  we were going to the Mash site and actually got a bit bored, but it was a long 6 miles hike, there is one hill that was a bit much but everything else is flat, the water is there but kind of stagnant.  But it was a good Sunday afternoon', 'Great trail! Not so far from Malibu beach. Good for pets.', 'This hike can be as long or short as well as easy or hard. A great hike from beginning to end, we hike to the mash site and pass on down to the dam and then when we hike back we hike century dam trail which is really awesome with shade from the trees and the lake which usually has ducks and sometimes turtles.  One of my favorites :-)', 'Another fun trail like heading up Mush trail.', ""I have approached Crags Rd from both the Grasslands Trail and Cistern Trail.  It's a very nice road for hiking.  At this point I'd say the MASH site is the best feature along the trail but then I'm of an age that I watched the original broadcasts of MASH.  I haven't been in the Visitor's Center for over a decade but at that time it was a worthwhile stop and may still be.  The easier approach is the Grasslands Trail.  The Cistern/Lookout Trail has really great views but hiking out is taxing.  It isn't that it climbs that much, about 450 ft, it just does it over a very short distance.  When you encounter steps on a trail you know there's a significant grade.  If you can leave a car at the Grasslands Trailhead and take another car to the Cistern Trailhead, you could walk down the scenic Cistern/Lookout Trails and exit the easier Grasslands Trail. Its about a 4.5 mile hike if you enter by the Cistern Trail, go to the MASH site, backtrack to the Visitors Center, and then exit the Grasslands Trail."", 'I loved that this was a long hike. Going through the State Park Main Entrance requires a parking fee of $12. We opted to park on the street and walked an extra 15 minutes, but that is the whole point of hiking during weekends.We saw the Mash Site. There were a lot of friendly trail bikers and trail runners. There are a few trails to explore. Almost every site is photo worthy. We saw some dogs both leashed and unleashed. A few hikers had toddlers on their backs. I can definitely go back here!', 'beautiful trail, the MASH site was very cool. lots of shade, so a good choice  on a hot summer day.', 'Mostly an easy trail, it gets very crowded in the weekends.', ""this spot is wicked mellow...with the exception of the rock garden. On the way to the MASH site, there are a couple different routes to take on the rock garden. One of them is pretty technical, and if your not on point it will not let you ride, the other spot is slightly easier, but you better have some fundamentals down before you just try to ride in there. I did some rock hopping to make it work...but if your cool with that than it's wicked fun."", ""Today was the first time I've come here. I liked it a lot. The rock pool is awesome and I had a fun day cliff diving with my sister. For sure coming back."", 'Love the changing scenery.

It can get a little crowded, especially on the weekend."", ""lots of land ..there's lots trails to choose from at easy, moderate and difficult levels. it does get a bit busy but the size of the open area makes feel like very little traffic.  parking is $12 but there's also free parking along the street side."", 'Awesome hike with friends! MASH site was super fun to see!', 'Pretty, not hilly, and took a little less than 3 hours.  Definitel6 glad I did it!', 'Beautiful area. Love the MASH site. Will be back someday soon. :)', ""Pretty good trail. Make sure you take the side trail to Century Dam (the Forest Trail). The best of the scenery is close to the trailhead--thus crowded with a lot of people who aren't serious hikers. A crowd reminiscent of Eaton Canyon. The MASH set is not particularly interesting if you're not a fan of the show. The area between Century Lake and the Rock Pool looks very interesting but we did not have time to explore. "", 'Gorgeous! Too crowded for my liking was the only downfall.', 'Great place. Love it! Easy, chill and most certainly a very friendly staff. ', 'When I went hiking here in the summer I did have to pay a $12.00 fee before entering the park per car.  This could have been because of the 4th of July weekend. Such a great trail. I went off the trail and did some bouldering which was fun!   ', 'A very nice hike through foothills, grassy areas, like-side trails and the filming location of M.A.S.H.  The hike on the everytrail Guide involves three spur trails, none of which are marked on the trails themselves.  So, it\'s useful to have a map of Malibu Creek Park trails, or download the Guide to your phone.  The main trail is ""Crags Road.""  The trail head is across the street from the parking lot.  It begins as a paved road and becomes a dirt road, a shaded trail, then small a dirt road from the MASH set to Malibu Lake.  The Rock Pool spur trail, which is approximately 1 from trail head, provides some opportunities for rock climbing, as well as the very nice swimming hole at the end of the spur trail.  The swimming hole can become quite crowded by the afternoon during the summer.\n\nI track the trail and the distance tracked was 10.0 miles.  I did take one spur trail not included on the Guide, which added approximately .5 miles total.  The Guide gives a distance 7.9 miles, but my best guess is that the distance is closer to 9.0 miles.  That said, it\'s an easy hike without much elevation change.  My tracking of the trail is here: http://www.everytrail.com/view_trip.php?trip_id=2181465', 'Very nice trail a little bit difficult to get to the mash set lot of rocks for your bike lots if hidden path in to the greens highly recommend', 'Nice place!

One technical area right before the MASH set.', 'Dirty water and dirty crowds. Go in Spring', ""Hiked Craigs trail to MASH site.  The good part is that Craigs provides a lot of trailheads you can take.  Originally, my hiking buddy and I wanted to go to Reagan but missed the connecting trail.  I suggest that you stop by the visitors center and get a map.  MASH site was cool and touristy because that's where the outdoor scenes were shot for the show MASH.  We went on a Sunday morning from 9ish to 11ish.  There were a lot of mountain bikers.

Well worth going all the way. The trail starts out over populated since it’s close to the highway. Initially this makes following the trail a little challenging but becomes easy as you go. Went Jan 1st so there was a bit of ice and snow.  Glad I had ice cleats. Couldn’t have done it without them.  I will definitely do this trail again!', 'Pretty. Wasn’t overly populated. Easy to get off trail here.', 'fantastic finish..larger lake then I expected..great and peacefull views to be had at lakes...moderate is appropriate rating..can be better marked at beginning..u never know who put cairns up off trail..once you cross railroad tracks be ready for a decent amount of tree root/rocky trail..great for an overnight camping trip..just pick a spot..stoves ok for now..couple good spots around 2nd lake on sandstone for fire pits...shall return next spring', 'This is a great hike. Challenging, but worth the trek especially if you intend to camp. Just a couple of things I found would make it more enjoyable. Keep your app open as it is helpful to get you back on track as this one is a tough one to follow in many places. There are cairns the entire trail... thank you to those putting those in place. I wore tennis shoes which was fine, but hiking boots would have been better especially with the rocky terrain that covers most of the trail. If you’re backpacking I recommend trekking poles. This made the trip a lot easier for me just for stability while carrying the weight on the rocks and over boulders and downed trees. Day pack probably not necessary. Camped out at the last lake, had some great picks with fire pits. It was pretty and only a couple of us up there for October. Beautiful night. Had cellphone service the entire way, but could also still hear the highway at the last lake as well.', 'Beautiful hike! Quite the workout, but very worth it!', 'Was great hike today. Hardly anyone there.  Despite what previous poster said, leashes ARE NOT required this being the national forest.  Would be very difficult to hike this trail with dogs on leashes.  Difficult for the dogs and difficult for the owners especially if your using hiking poles which btw I recommend.  Besides it’s usually the leashes dogs that are aggressive or unsocialized.   Or the owners’ anxiety that causes this.  Our group had 6 very well behaved trail dogs that are used to hiking. And yes we pick up the poop.  Overall good hike, a lot of uphill; thus, a lot downhill.', 'Be advised - this trail is for LEASHED dogs only! And please be considerate of others who might have dog fears or leashed dogs with some aggression issues. I was appalled when I walked the trail yesterday!', 'loved this hike, steep but so worth it!', 'Great hike. Would consider more moderate than difficult. One downside is the freeway noise for the first mile or so', 'Lovely hike but extremely busy. Almost ended up making camp away from the lakes as there was hardly a spot to setup camp. Finally found a nice little spot at the  northeast end of Upper Loch Leven Lake.', 'Great trip last weekend with my eight year old daughter and some friends.  This was her first trip and was as good hike for both of us. The lakes are absolutely gorgeous and the 2nd lake is perfect for camping. We got a little lost on the granite before the railroad, but the markers were pretty good to help get us back on track. The only downside is the number of people. We saw people everywhere we looked and had people hiking through our campsite on the east side of the lake constantly.  Nevertheless, the experience was great for the first time and having my 8 year old say at the end of the trip "" We are so doing that again!"" was the highlight for me!', ""NOTE: For those complaining about people walking through your campsite, don't  camp by the trail or water! First of all, it's expected that people would walk through. Secondly, there's a rule that you set up camp at least 200 feet away from both the trail and the water. Don't blame others if you were one to not follow those guidelines (and use your judgment).\n\nThe first time I did this trail was on 7/4/2017. I went back a few weeks ago with my friend who I had actually met there, then I went on 8/11/18 to backpack with my boyfriend for the Perseids meteor shower. I was worried about it being a tough hike with our packs, but it wasn't bad at all since we averaged about 35 minutes on the way up. I also made sure to hydrate the day before and day of.\n\nAs others may have mentioned, you can take the wrong path where all of the exposed granite is. There are cairns that do help, but at least keep the map on you. Other than just a couple of those spots, the trail is easy to follow. There are lots of downed trees that are climbable, or you can walk around a few of them. Also pack lots of water or at least bring a filter, and bring food. Sunscreen is also a great idea.\n\nAfter the seemingly-endless rocky switchbacks, you'll notice that this is the perfect hike your both you and your furry friend to swim in an alpine lake or three! The lakes are also never packed, so they're truly gems hidden away into the mountains. All three are beautiful. We camped at the second lake atop a granite hill. Beautiful view of the sky..\n\nBy the way, if you think you hear a bear, it might just be the common nighthawk making booming sounds with its wings. It scared us half to death."", 'Absolutely beautiful trail! Very fun and a great challenge, but we definitely got off trail a few times. I’d definitely recommend having someone come with you who knows the trail. There were a few stretches where the trail dwindles off and you can’t really tell where to go. But other than that amazing!', 'Spectacular views, lots of campsites. Very rocky.', 'Absolutely love this trail. I’ve done it three times now. It’s definitely a work out and a climb so bring plenty of water. I made the mistake of not bringing enough for both my dog and myself and it hurt me bad. Also watch your footing as the granite and loose rocks can make for an easy ankle roll (did that my second time on the hike). Lakes are gorgeous at the top and there’s plenty of spots for everyone to sit and enjoy. You’ll see backpackers and day hikers at the top and you’ll share smiles because the hike was not an easy one. Recommend bringing a lunch or snacks if you’re making it a day trip :)', 'I always forget about the bouldery portion after the train tracks- strenuous but then eases up on the knees after that. The higher lake is definitely worth getting to, less crowded.', 'Tough hike but very rewarding. Visited the three lakes and Lake Salmon on the way back. I’m glad I wore ankle high hiking boots over the rough, rocky and rutted trail.', ""I love this trail! I've hit it in skis, snowshoes, and hiking boots. Good times all around."", 'Kicked my butt trail. Nice elevation change. Wish the smoke wasn’t there right now. A lot of the normal views were not visible but the hike was a lot of fun and I’m so glad that people have kept the trail so clean.', 'Super nice and diversified trail! We did it as a half day hike (a little bit under two hours to the highest lake). In my opinion more a MODERATE then a hard hike (there for sure is a rocky section tho). The first 0.5 mile of the trail is a little tricky to follow, I was glad I brought my phone for GPS. Bring your dog and plan on taking a dip in the lake(s)!', 'I agree that it is a hard hike, especially coming back down. If you have a knee issue, use poles to soften the impact on the rocks, tree roots and just altogether steep and rugged trail terrain.  The lakes are worth all the hard work to reach them. Middle Loch Leven is about 6 miles RT, but don’t get fooled by the shorter mileage. It’s still tough go. I have thought to make it a shuttle by putting a car at the Salmon Lake TH & hiking out by way of Salmon Lake & in at the Loch Leven TH. This would make hiking out less strenuous on folks with knee problems like I have.', 'This trail kicked my butt! Thankfully I went with a group who knew the trail, otherwise I never would have been able to stay on track. There are portions where you’re climbing/hiking over big slabs of rock and I still have no idea how they knew which way to go. I’d definitely recommend having this mapped out before losing service (although my phone worked the whole time). The views were beautiful at the top, but this is definitely strenuous; it was uphill the entire way. My group hiked up to the second lake because it wasn’t much further and it was worth it. We stopped there and had lunch, got in the lake, and then went back. Be prepared to work hard and bring lots of water because you’ll need it! The way down was a little rough too just because it’s very steep and my poor knees felt the impact the next day. Overall- great workout and beautiful lakes.', ""Do not attempt on a mtb. I couldn't find any info saying it's not allowed. You'll find yourself carrying your mtb 80% of the time and that's from RR tracks and down. Was not fun."", 'Took my kids up to the middle lake for two nights. The lake was beautiful and perfect for swimming with some great jumping rocks.  Trail was rocky and steep at times.  Did it in running shoes and regretted not having hiking boots.  We were tired so decided not to head up to the upper lake, also heard it was pretty crowded up there.  The lakes were beautiful but the rocky trail was tough on the feet.  Would do it again!', 'Up hill to lake..lake seemed to be dead ( no fish) pretty but   better hikes', 'Great hike, but hot this weekend (Mid July). Bring lots of water. Plan to swim or bring a float to enjoy the beautiful lakes.', 'recently backpacked loch levens for an overnighter. trail is mostly uphill and rocky, but not horrible. The hike was quick and lower loch leven had a great camping spot towards the back. Overall, was a great hike and camp.', 'Day hike, over night camping, fishing, dog friendly and beautiful granite basin lake to swim!', 'This trail was very challenging, but also rewarding.  We went on a Saturday in June , and saw a lot of hikers on the way up, but not so much that I would call it crowded. Everyone was conscientious and kind, good hiking ethic all around.  I didn’t see any trash and didn’t see any signs of irresponsible hikers.   (According to the forest service,  Campfires are allowed with a permit, which you can pick up at any ranger station and online w CALFire.) A wonderful trail to explore!   We did it as an overnight backpacking trip and I’m glad we did, because we needed the rest in between.   The hike back was also challenging, although mostly downhill, because of slippery rocks and steep terrain. Come prepared with a lot of water and a strong will to succeed, it is worth it.  Ps- the trail can be easy to lose at parts, especially around the granite rocks.  They have painted orange marks on the granite to help guide the way. A map is helpful.', ""This was a good go, up to the three lakes.  But, VERY rocky and rooted in sections.  If you're looking for a decent hike to a couple of beautiful alpine lakes, consider the Azalea/Flora lake trail which TH just east of Boreal and behind the Donner summit rest area.  MUCH better and shorter trail and the lakes are not as big, but very pretty and swimmable."", 'Early June, not a lot of people. Lakes are serene', 'I went on May 31st. Gorgeous Lakes. The snow is gone now. I enjoyed noticing the freeway get quieter and quieter until the noise disappeared entirely. I started on the trail at 6:30 am and saw no one for four hours. I loved it.', ""Beautiful, challenging hike.  Be prepared to go up switchbacks, climb over logs, and trek through a rocky trail, but it's so worth it because the lakes are gorgeous. It took us about 6 hours but that included resting at each of the lakes and getting lost- trail can be a bit un clear.  \nNo snow June 2nd, but a bit of the trail had a small stream flowing down it and was a bit wet."", 'This trail will be GREAT in about a month. It’s got great elevation gain and beautiful views, but you can hear the freeway for much of the hike. When I went in early May and there was enough snow that I started to post hole in places. Once my feet got cold and wet I turned around. I would definitely try this hike again when it’s not covered in snow.', 'Fantastic hike as always. Still a few feet of snow beyond the railroad (as of May 5, 2018), but getting up to the first lake is entirely doable in waterproof shoes or boots.', 'Great hike. Still a lot of snow to trek through.', 'Our family has enjoyed this both as a day-hike and as an overnight.', 'As others have mentioned, trail is a little hard to follow at first. look for footprints in the snow and cairns. Lots of ice on the trail, recommend yaktrax. Snow is deeper after the foot bridge. I turned around just below the first lake as the trail disappeared and I began postholing to my knees, snowshoes would be helpful here. Fairly strenuous trail and good views along the way. Dog loved it and I was the only one there on a Tuesday.', 'You can’t go wrong with a trip here. Fun to get too from both trails.', 'Interesting and always a little different depending on the time of year.  In the summer make sure you have the right gear on for a swim at the top!', ""Don't go without ice trackers.  Icy granite is no fun in just hiking boots!  It was my own fault for not being more prepared, but I will be back, it's absolutely beautiful.  probably made it a half mile in before hitting an impasse and turning around..."", ""First part of trail hard to follow. Had to look for stacked rocks to figure out which way to go. Hardest part of hike is to the first lake. Make sure to go the extra distance and hit the second lake...it was stunning. Third lake was difficult to find and I'm not sure we even found it or it was really just a small pond. We went in early part of September"", 'There are many false trails in the beginning. You really need a GPS to stay straight. The uphill is like climbing stairs.  At times like climbing up a dry creek/waterfall. Did not make it to the lake, so, only 3 stars.', ""Nice hike.  Went as far as Lower LL lake as a day hike.  About 7.5 miles, but had some false starts at the beginning that added a bit.  Most of the first 3 miles is uphill, but not to the point it is extreme.  I found coming back down to be more fatiging, as there are a lot of large steps down.  Felt like an hours worth of squats in the gym.  Most challenging part is staying on trail during the first quarter mile or so.  The trail goes across rock and isn't obvious.  Lots of false trails that lead nowhere."", 'Very disappointed and offended.  First off I have been going to these lakes since the 1960\'s when my father took me fishing here as a young boy.  Yes, back then there were fish in these lakes and my father taught me to catch and release here to preserve the fishing so others could enjoy later down the road.  We have a cabin just miles from the TH so this was a place we would hike on a regular basis.  My father passed when I was 12 years old, I have continued to go here throughout the years to present date.  \n\nWhen I was younger this trail was rarely used, in fact there was little to no erosion on the trail, yes that\'s right the trail was easily hiked on back then.  Now to the present time.  Thanks to the internet and word of mouth this trail and the lakes in the area are over used and being abused by people that have no clue what they are doing in nature.  The trail has eroded to a rock ruble torn up mess, the lakes have all been fished out by selfish so called anglers and the backpackers are leaving behind human waste along the shores and surrounding areas within the 200 foot space and burning illegal camp fires.  \n\nSo, all of you reading this....... If you come to this beautiful place, leave no trace !  If you are camping here and using the land as your bathroom, do it right, get away from the lakes a minimum of 200 feet, dig a hole at least 16 to 20 inches deep and bury your crap !!  Pick up your ass wipe and pack it out with you !!  I saw so much human crap and ass wipe on my last hike here on Labor Day 2017 it made me sick.  \n\nI am a regular here and have been for over 50 years, I practice what I preach and care for the natural resources I use.  I keep a lookout for those abusing the area and yes If I see you doing something wrong I will let you know about it, take photos of you doing illegal tasks and report you to the rangers, so treat this place with respect.   \n\nUpdate.....\n\nI just called the USFS in Nevada City , CA.  I have requested to speak to one of the land resources managers there.  I have also emailed them with links to posts on Facebook that some visitors of Loch Leven Lakes have posted with campfires burning.  FYI, CAMP FIRES ARE NOT PERMITTED IN THE AREA !  I am going to push to have rangers do more patrols in the area for illegal fires and littering of human waste and ass wipe.  I am also going to push to have human waste bags a requirement here when doing over night  campouts. \n\nYou have all heard the phrase, "" one bad apple "".  Well, there is more than one bad apple using this area and I am going to do my best to clean it up !', 'HARD but beautiful trail. Expect lots of uphill and a rough trail. It looks like the trail has eroded a lot from rain/snow melt--so lots of boulders and rocks. We packed up to the High Loch Leven lake--worth it to escape the crowds and enjoy the beautiful lake. Lots of granite rock scrambling nearby and a ridge near the lake to climb for a great view.', 'Fantastic trail!!!  Gorgeous alpine lakes and wildflowers.', 'Worth it!', 'Great hike with wild flowers and prize at the top, serene lakes. Climb up the rocks is a good workout and well worth it. Started early morning on a Friday and was nice with very few people. Middle lake was perfect for a swim. Wear hiking shoes and bring lots of water. Moderate hike and  be ready for incline up the rocks .', 'Beautiful lakes. Pretty intense uphill with pack.', 'Went on 7/23/17 with my fiancé and our dog. The trail took us about 5 hours, with stopping at the second lake for a bit.  We did not go to the third lake.  This is NOT a trail for beginners, the rating of difficult is accurate.\n\nDog considerations: If you are going to hike this trail, I seriously suggest that your dog wear rubberized hiking booties.  The trail contains many areas with jagged, rough, loose rocks.  We saw a couple of dogs limping, or with bleeding feet.  Our dog, Leopold, wore Petacc booties with rubber bottoms and they saved his feet. For under $20 from Amazon, you have no excuse.  This was the first time our dog wore booties, and we are so glad we brought them.\n\nParking: The parking area is clearly marked, has bare-minimum composting restrooms, and we found it easily using Google maps from Sacramento.\n\nTrail: The trail-head has a marker and begins across the street from the parking lot, at about the mid-point of the parking lot.  The trail was easy to find for the most part.  We had some difficulty finding the trail on the way back down, during what was the first half-mile of the trail when we were going up.  If it feels unsafely steep then you’re probably not on the trail!  We had to venture more to the right (facing down the mountain) and we linked back up with the proper trail.  A lot of the trail was in the shade, after ascending the first steep, rock mountain-side portion.  However, 95% of the trail was steeply uphill on the way to the lakes, so bring a lot of water and some snacks!  It also cooled off at the lake elevation, but was pretty hot until that point.  There were a few areas where the trail was blocked by fallen trees, but we were able to navigate around them easily.\n\nLakes: We did not spend a ton of time at the first lake, and instead splashed around in the second lake and ate our lunch there.  Our dog picked up a leech at one of the lakes, which we noticed on the way back down.  He likely picked it up in the first lake, because it was smaller and more murky.  The second lake was clearer and larger and I didn’t notice any leeches on me after playing in the water there.  (Maybe don’t play in the first lake!)\n\nDifficulty: All Trails is not joking when they say this hike is difficult.  If you haven’t hiked in years, or do not exercise regularly, I would not recommend this hike for you.  There are many slippery portions, a lot of loose, sharp rocks, and the trail is a steep ascent.\n\nTraffic: Contrary to some other reviewers, we found this trail to be lightly trafficked on the Sunday we went.  We passed 5-6 small pods of people on the way up, and fewer on the way down.  At the second lake, where we stopped for a bit, there were only two other people and one dog enjoying the lake.  We saw the fire ring and camping area at the second lake, but no one was there.  Looked like a great spot to camp!\n\nRating: Five stars for great views, pristine (second) lake, and a good workout!', 'Over all great hike. Several groups camping but the hike was fine for single day.\nVery rocky trail with lots of slabs and boulders. Gotta be pretty hard on the dogs feet!\nThe lakes are very nice but in the summer heat you need to start early. The return trip gets HOT!', ""This trail is so awesome. Challenging, but so worth it! Easy to get to with a parking lot across from the trailhead. I got there around 6:45 am and there were few cars there, by the time I came back down, the lot was full. I didn't see anyone, with the exception of a deer, on my way to the lakes, but passed tons of people on my way down - when it was already so hot. I recommend taking this hike in the morning. I hiked to all three lakes. Saw a few people camping at each lake. Getting to the third lake wasn't as hard as I had anticipated and was really happy the lakes were about a half mile apart. This is a hard trail. Step climbs and assents. But each step of the way is truly beautiful. I got turned around a lot on the granite sections, easily losing the trail, but thanks to the map, I found my way. If you've wanted to check this hike off of your list, do it. And bring trekking poles, if you've got em."", ""I just backpacked this trail June 21-22 and It was a beautiful and rewarding hike. My buddy and I wanted do some backpacking, but both had limited time and couldn't get up to there until early evening on Friday, so we appreciated that the trailhead was easily accessible right off the freeway, and that the trail itself was not too long. The lakes are all beautiful. My favorite was probably the 2nd lake, as it was the largest and best for swimming in. It was a bit crowded up there Friday night, and since we had a late start we had to settle for a less desirable camp site. The trail Itself had quite a few fallen trees across it, but otherwise it was dry and relatively easy to follow. Overall a great, and relatively short trail to do for those who have limited time, but still want a moderately challenging hike to get their heart rate up."", 'We headed out Friday morning and found a nice camp spot at the middle lake. Beautiful. However, by Saturday morning crowds of people came pouring into the lake. We were a bit disappointed w/our fellow trail mates. We had unfriendly hikers walking through our campsite early Sat. morning. We watched as one groups dog pooped in the lake right were we were filtering water. We decided to leave and the trail was so crowded that it took a long time to get down. Only one small creek is running near bottom of trail. A lot of folks were running out of water half way up the trail. We watched several people carry out or push tired kids and dogs down the trail. If you like crowds this is the trail for you. If your looking for solitude or serious trail folk stay away or come on a weekday.', ""Loved this hike yesterday! It is no joke in terms of the uphill climb for the first half, but the beautiful lakes are totally worth the great workout. The rocks were a little challenging at times, but not a big deal for me or my dad - though some folks on the trail were complaining about them. Do swim in the middle lake - made all the difference in terms of feeling refreshed for the way back down - and as long as you swim in the top layer, the water isn't that cold. Lots of beautiful wildflowers, crazy awesome views of the lakes. Bring plenty of water, sunscreen and snacks. Enjoy!"", 'Beautiful hike!  2nd lake is the prettiest.  At times trail can be difficult to stay in.', ""Hike was gorgeous.  Pretty rocky so wear boots, at times it was easy to get off trail but majority of the time it's obvious where to go and trail was in good shape.  Water was refreshing so make sure you jump in (especially lake 2) and bring some snacks.  The hike back was much easier but just watch your step!"", ""Such a beautiful hike! So many wildflowers. Wear shoes with ankle support and be prepared to jump in the lakes because they are difficult to resist! \n\nTried some tenkara around noon but didn't have any luck."", 'Favorite!', 'Trail was in good shape. No snow and only a little water on the trail. Maybe a dozen logs down, but easy to detour each. Easy to follow, but between Lakes 2&3 the app was helpful as we followed a well-beaten path to a pond next to #2 when trying to go to #3. Great scenery, and minimal people on a Thursday morning', ""Holiday weekends are never the business and after reading a lot of discouraging reviews made me question the validity of bringing along my SEVEN year old daughter. With that being said, so glad I trusted my own skills and had faith her physical prowess to carry her own pack and equipment. It was a very busy weekend to say the least, but we found the trail to be pleasant. The snow runoff on parts of the trail were very welcoming since it kept dust levels down in the dry arid summer air. I do recommend using the AllTrails App for the initial granite section since the cairns aren't placed well or have been knocked over. We found it easier to walk straight up the face of the granite slab instead of traversing. The granite held nice traction as we climbed straight up towards a cluster of 10 trees stand (where the trail wraps around the side of the hill). Once you are off the granite the trail is beautiful. So much diversity in vegetation and micro-climates. If you run low on water, there are streams to filter from, and for fun drink from some natural springs along the way. With the heavy snow fall this past winter created fun trail obstacles and sitting water on parts of the trail, all were easily maneuverable or avoidable by traversing around (She loved climbing them). The trail isn't a smooth single track, plenty of rock steps to be had. I guess this is way it is rated as hard or from people underestimating what a 1k climb entails. Swimming at the second lake was the highlight of our trip. Can't wait to go again so we can hike to the 3rd lake. Can see this as a great day hike or an overnight get away. \n\nJust remember to practice carry in, carry out practices. If you see it pick it up, even if it isn't yours. We picked up tons of other peoples trash on the way back. There are garbage cans in the bathrooms. tsk tsk"", ""The lakes are beautiful. The trail itself was sometimes difficult to find and it's very rocky so even tho it's about 8 miles it felt longer. Would definitely hike it again."", ""We hiked to the third lake to camp on July 4th and we're the only overnight campers. Loch Leven lake was beautiful and felt like our private lake. The trail was challenging and I was very thankful that I was able to use my AllTrails map to help navigate in a few spots."", ""I hiked this trail today on July 4 and there was only one small section with snow on the actual trail. Many people say that the trail needs maintenance, but it really isn't too too bad. I almost didn't go based on these comments. There are fallen trees and logs, but they are easy to get around. There are areas that are quite vague regarding where the trail continues, and they tend to be where you climb on the granite. Look for the trail cairns as they helped us a few times.The hike to the high lake (3rd and last lake) was well worth it. After the 1-mile hike to the railroad tracks, you then start the rocky switchback section that eventually levels out before the first lake. This almost-constant uphill section with continuous rockiness makes me believe that the trail is moderate-to-hard.You then hike another mile or so to the third lake. We also swam to the island and the water was perfect temperature. I should note that there was a garter snake that swam in front of me, but thankfully my fellow hiker did not mention it until I was completely out of the water."", 'The trail is not in very good shape.', 'Trail is in pretty poor shape but the hike is worth it. Still lots of snow and runoff.', ""Used to be my favourite trail in the Sierras. Now it's good for a weekday hike, forget about the weekend. Did it yesterday, trail is in desperate need of cleaning up. Passed about 60 people on my way back down."", 'Amazing, amazing, amazing hike.  So beautiful with lots of different terrain.', 'Hi, does anyone know if there is safe drinking water available at the lakes?', 'My girlfriends and I did an overnight to the second lake on this trail.  We started around 3:00pm and made it to the lake with plenty of time for a swim and to get settled in before dark.  The trail was a challenging elevation gain but so worth it!  Highly recommended for the views during the day and at night- the stars were amazing!  Only a few patches of snow off the sides of the trails which our dogs were very excited to roll in.  There were many other campers, but we found a camp spot far enough away we felt secluded.', ""A nice hike with decent views and an overall great reward at the end. The lakes were awesome, great to cool off in after a long trek. However there were quite a few places where the trail forked to false trails or where the trail was difficult to keep track of. On top of that at this time the trail was very muddy and had a lot of runoff with slippery rocks. Quite a few fallen logs and boulders blocking the trail at certain spots although I am sure at some point this will be removed. Be careful, plenty of places to slip or miscalculate a step.\nAlso for any dog owners please be careful. I took my GSD up and he blistered and cut his paws up pretty bad and aside from myself there were 2 other dog owners who's little companions had some problems on the trail. Maybe consider getting your dog some boots for hiking. We had to carry my guy down and trust me neither you nor your dog is going to enjoy that."", 'A lot of the trail is like a creek   All the melt off making its way down the hill   And boo coo insects around the first lake     but a good hike with a lot of people on the trail', 'Trail a little rocky', 'This is a great trail but there were a lot of people out today. There are still many snow fields the higher your climb but nothing to crazy and the foot traffic makes it hard to get lost. Up at the lakes, the ground is super saturated and a couple inches deep at some spots.', 'Hard but worthwhile. There is still a lot of snow after 1.3 miles and the trail is literally a stream. Expect to walk on rocks and boulders, use your hiking poles for the snow and enjoy the beauty of the waterfalls and lakes.', ""Great hike, but quite difficult given the amount of snow if you aren't prepared. You won't want/need snow shoes, but crampons / ice cleats will make this hike much easier and doable.The lakes are full of snow but still very beautiful. Lots of little waterfalls everywhere. Bring sunglasses!!! I forgot mine and was seriously regretting this oversight."", ""Today was tricky and challenging because there is still sooo much snow and as you get closer to the top of the mountainside after the train tracks, it got very mushy and slippery so we had to stop. Even though we didn't make it to the lakes this time, it was beautiful and a perfect day. We did see a rubber boa - exciting! The navigation was pretty difficult on the early part of the trail and then again through the snow, not sure how we would have made it without downloading the AllTrails map and tracking our progress on it. Can't wait to get up there again after some snow melts!"", 'I am not ready for hard trails but was able to make my way almost to the top and back. I had a blast. I am looking forward in trying this trail again and making it all the way in and out after i achieve more in weight loss and get more in shape and have hiked more trails. the weather today was gorgous.', 'Beautiful', ""This is just a great hike. It's simple yet strenuous at times especially in getting to the first lake. But once you're there you forget all the muscle aches."", 'Classic high Sierra Nevada terrain and a great day hike. Parking is free and the trail head rather easy to find.  The trail is marked but I suggest a map (as always) because it is easy to get off the trail.  I rarely worry about ""the trail"" and we actually got off of it to climb the rocky peaks.  Yes, I would recommend .', ""Super fun trail! The first mile or so is a killer because it's straight up but after you get warmed up its awesome. I really really enjoyed this trail. The only downside to it was every now and then we would loose the trail. overall this is definitely one of my favorites."", 'This hike starts with some rocky terrain on big granite surfaced which create a nice moon surface like feel and then passes through some fir and juniper forest with ferns below. A relatively steep ascent over the ridge follows but the lakes are well worth the effort.', ""Hiked late September in 2016.  Got caught up in rain on day 1 (pretty fierce storm caused flash flood warnings in the morning).  Had the trail and High Loch Leven all to ourselves that night.  While on the trail, keep your eyes peeled for cairns and bright orange spray paint on the boulders.  Only at one point between Upper and High did I panic when the trail took a near 90 degree turn to the right and I couldn't see it.  At that point, we back tracked, calmed our nerves and tried again ( I hope the cairn I made is still there, LOL).  Day 2 was clear and beautiful with a pleasant hike back out.  One of my favorite trails.  We plan to return and try the trip via Salmon Lake trail."", 'Was a goodum  steep heading up  took me about 2-1/2 hrs to get to furthest lake but only about 35 minutes to get back down to my truck at trailhead', ""Definitely my favorite so far in tahoe. Despite being a climb the first couple miles it's not too far and you have a choice of a few lakes to camp at. Gets crowded in the summer but you can have campfires and there's no permit required. Trail can be confusing to follow at times. Just look for the stacked rocks."", ""Don't go.  Not good."", ""Oddly difficult to find the trail in the first   part of the hike, you'd think that would be the easiest section to maintain... keep your eyes open for foot prints and cairns and print out a topographic map to stay on track. Mostly the trail is very rocky and steep, a moderate hike that leans towards difficult. I did it in sneakers but I'd recommend heavier soled hiking boots due to all the rocks. I went on a Monday in late August and saw about 12 other folks and four dogs. The lochs were beautiful and refreshing and there were plenty of mountain top views. I hope I can come back some time and camp."", ""I like this hike. It's just long enough for a full 5 hour hike with some stops for snacks and photos. There were many people out on the Sunday we were there. I would categorize it as moderately well traveled. Be prepared for lots of rocky, uneven, unstable surfaces. This is definitely not for those with weak ankles. Many dogs on the trail appeared to be enjoying themselves. The beginning is a steep climb up the boulders- easy to get lost from any sort of real trail, follow the stacked rocks as best you can and head right and up. You'll hit the trail and follow it to the first lake. Continue the path right if you want to get to the second lake. The third lake it also just around the corner; the path is hard to follow but there are a few orange marks on boulders and stacks of rocks again. Use your best judgement and pay attention, lots of wobbly and uneven surfaces. Moderate trail for sure- harder for those unexperienced folks, a very nice moderate hike for those with experience."", 'Beautiful views. Wonderful lakes. Poorly maintained trail with lots of loose rocks. Be careful.', 'The lakes themselves are pristine and beautiful.  The actual trail itself was challenging but very annoying.  The trail is mostly loose rock on large stretches, and even with good hiking shoes, i almost slipped or rolled an ankle plenty of times on the way down (not as big of an issue on the way up).  Also the trail itself does not have too much to see aside from some rail tracks until you get to the lake.  I will take the suggestion from other reviewers and try getting there from Salmon Lake next time to enjoy the lakes and  not hurt myself doing so.', ""Excellent. Nostalgic. Great vista on the way to the top. Unfortunately it's a bit heavily trafficked"", ""The lakes are the only good thing about this trial and it's easier to get to the lakes via the Salmon Lake Trial, which is shorter, less elevation gain, and beautiful. This trail should not be the designated loch leven trail; salmon lake trial is the most direct and it's beautiful too.  Check it out."", ""This is not an easy hike but it's worth it. The serene beauty of the lakes will take your breath away. The hike is steep with over 1400 foot elevation gain. There are loose rocks and boulders you have to climb but the views are beautiful.

The second lake is only 1/4 mile farther and offers great swimming."", 'No snow on June 11.  great hike !', 'Very beautiful trail but definitely challenging.

There are a couple of great spots to set up camping, it's a fantastic trail to get in shape for bigger backpacking trips."", ""Went June 1st, and wore low top hiking shoes (oops).   I don't love traversing, but most of all, hiking over loose rock is a pet peeve of mine.  I understand the reasoning to preserve the trail from snow runoff damage, but it is mostly hiking up a creek right now, a wet mess. The snow banks covering the trail closer to the top were slippery and melty, thanks to the sudden hot weather, and the trail was hidden by snow banks nearer the top.   Love the lakes, nothing new there!"", 'There was a still a good amount of snow covering trail making it hard to follow. Also trails had a lot of water coming down.

Not uncommon for the Sierra Nevadas but unexpected with all our prepped food, etc. Beautiful trail, nicely shaded making it comfortably accessible throughout the summer. Many lakes and the river for swimming in!', ""It was a beautiful hike. The trail was mostly shaded, which was great.

Would like to backpack overnight at Middle Loch Leven next time..had some pretty sweet spots.', ""On destination alone, absolute five stars. But the trail there . . . I don't mind uphill, but I do mind the constant traversing over rocks that someone decided was a great way to build a trail. Nope. While it was fun to go up the rocks that are naturally on the trail, (as in actually crossing granite!) my issue is with the large drainage rocks that were purposely placed there for large stretches of the trail. I assume this is to help with avoiding turning the trail into a stream bed during spring, but it was otherwise a nightmare. EACH step on a face-sized sharp rock either brought an opportunity to twist an ankle or just plain ruin your shoes.  Since it was otherwise a moderate elevation climb, we all wore sneakers. And, we all ruined our sneakers. \n\nSince the climb was a constant uphill that did not even out, I just don't think making the traverse more difficult with loose drainage rock is worth it. \n\nWe did spend the night at the first lake, and it was amazing. Lots of fun once up there, and one of the prettiest little lakes I've ever seen. We ran into some other hikers who came to the lake via Salmon Trail, and we'll be doing that from here on out to spend the night up at the first lake. (Which I'd recommend as a starter backpacking trip with kids.) So, if you want to see the lake, do the Salmon Trail to get there. The loch leven trail is only really useful for people who hate a leisurely, carefree hike without a view. You really can't enjoy the scenery on the loch leven trail, because if you take your eyes off the drainage rocks you're constantly traversing, you'll probably fall."", 'An absolutely beautiful hike and the destinations were spectacular.  Mostly uphill which was a little difficult on my daughter (11 yrs) who was backpacking for the first time with a pack.  I would definitely suggest trekking poles which are especially helpful in the rocky terrain.  Some of the trail is tough to follow in one of the granite areas - look for the trail markers.  They are helpful but be careful not to trust them too much as there are a lot of them and some hikers have made their own trail over the granite area.  All in all, once you get up the granite rock face, you should be able to find the trail without much difficulty.  We stayed overnight at Middle Loch Leven as we heard from a dayhiker who was headed down that High Loch was pretty full.  We hiked to High Loch as a day hike in the morning.  All three lakes are extremely picturesque.

Very enjoyable and satisfying. Camp site was out'a site. I'd like to go back."", ""This was a relatively easy backpacking over-nighter, being only 3+ miles to the High Loch.  We missed the crowds Friday night, but they were sure coming up the trail saturday!  Gorgeous setting among big granite, easy off-trail exploration, plus an easy side-trip to Salmon lake made for a great 2 days!  Would love to go back sometime when it's not as dry."", ""Nice trail with a steady climb up most of the way. Middle lake was a little crowded on the weekend but a beautiful place to be. If you don't mind all the people it's a nice trail to hike."", ""The family and I  overnighted at the Loch's. We came in via the Salmon Lake Trail which is a better way to go if you have kids. My son (6 yrs) and daughter (10 yrs) carry their own packs and at 2.6 miles it was a good test on a moderate trail. You will pass by a beautiful small lake with lilly pads and is full of small black bullhead catfish which will swim right up to you if you soak your feet in the cool water. That night there was a full moon that was super bright and made star gazing a bit difficult, bad planning on my part.

Lots and lots of hikers, mostly day hikers!!', ""This is a long hike spanning a wide variety of flora and fauna. It's rocky and challenging for most of the way up, but plateaus and snakes down into the first of three lakes once you reach the top. The way up is a good 5+ miles so when you see that beautiful alpine water, it's all worth it. This is the kind of hike that reminds you of a million reasons to love the Sierras. I even did it three months out from a fractured knee cap! So to those that might think it too much, you can do it and it's so worth it! I'd recommend this for anyone looking for the perfect day adventure. Also! It completely wiped my year and a half old lab out.

The trail at the beginning is a bit hard to discern but just keep on climbing the granite rocks and eventually it makes sense (plus it's only one way up).

After the hike, one can stop at the rainbow lodge up ahead for some drinks and or dinner with very friendly staff and locals seated at the bar."", 'Our group, all seniors, enjoy hiking this trail and do it annually.  Sometimes we enter from Hysink Lake (after 4 miles on a dirt road).  This is easier than taking the trip up from Big Bend over all the granite.  The round trip to Upper Loch Leven, (including the spur out to Salmon Lake) is about 5.8 beautiful miles.', 'Went with a group of girl friends on a long weekend backpacker to the Loch Leven Lakes area using this trail. The trailhead was easy to access with some decent parking available and a fire station just down the street. Keeping on the first part of the trail was a little challenging as we walked over granite and through low growing shrubs cross crossed by many game trails/alternate paths. The info we had rated the trail as moderate and while it seemed so on the way to the lakes with a 1200ft climb in just over 1.5 miles, the return trip impressed upon us just how steep some of the ascent had been. That not withstanding, the trip was well worth it providing beautiful vistas and sunsets, lovely lake camping and some pretty good solitude (we had the middle lake to ourselves 2/3 days there with the exception of a few day hikers). The surrounding area provided some relaxing picturesque walks and was enjoyed by our canine companions as well. We were visited by geese/ducks daily who seemed unbothered by our residence. Hiking this without a loaded pack would make for a more enjoyable trip. There is an alternate route to the lakes from the Salmon Lakes trail off Hwy 80 at Yuba Gap exit.', ""A friend suggested this hike a few months ago.  I also read that you can snowshoe here, and as I am interested in trying snowshoeing for the first time, I wanted to check this trail out.  It was very easy to get to.  I got there around 11.30am, and the small parking lot was full, but there was still space to park on the roadside.  The trailhead is directly across from the parking lot, and that's where my troubles began.  \n\nI had a difficult time following the trail from the beginning.  The path is not obvious.  You really have to keep a sharp eye out for cairns or other route markers that others have left (like a piece of wood pointing right), especially on the rock sections.  I had to stop at many points to figure out where the trail went.  I relied heavily on a track I downloaded from a different app that showed me which direction to go.  I even started building cairns myself, since I knew I would have trouble later to help me find my way back.  Another problem was that there are multiple paths that you can take.\n\nThankfully, the trail becomes easier to follow once you cross the railroad tracks.  It's pretty much straight with very few switchbacks.  The path is rocky, but not like scree.  It's not anything I would suggest gaiters for; however, the trail gets quite narrow in some places due to the brush growing alongside.  It's easy to get your legs scratched up if you're wearing shorts or capris like I was \n\nIt seemed to take a long time to reach the first lake, but after Lower Loch, the other two lakes came in quick succession.  I would definitely continue on to Higher Loch Lake.  It's only 3/4 miles further from Middle Loch, and it's very serene up there.  Middle Loch though was my favorite of the three.  Fall is a great time to visit.  The leaves are changing color, so the views of the lakes are very pretty, with hints of red and orange reflected in the pools.  \n\nThe path back to the trailhead was so much easier, probably because I was more familiar with it.  Also, the trail looked more obvious as I started noticing the lines of rocks marking the route and other markers that I missed previously.  There were still some confusing spots, but not as bad.  The cairns I made were tremendously helpful too.  All in all, it was a nice hike.  If snowshoeing is possible here during winter, it would be for more advanced folks, so I probably won't come back here for that.  Would I come back here for another day hike?  Maybe."", ""Awesome Hike- this site says 6 miles, but I used my GPS and it was 3.9 miles from the trailhead to lower Loch Leven lake (the first of the three).  If you hike around to the other two lakes and then back out, the total mileage is about 9 miles.  Beautiful hike- exposed rocks climbs, heavily wooded forest, meadows, and gorgeous alpine lakes.  I rated it 4 stars not 5 because most of the trail is loose gravel- like you are walking up a dry creek bed- and the trail is hard to keep track of at some points.  Highly recommend  this hike! A couple I met told me you can gain access to the lakes on the back side of the mountain from Yuba Gap area that is less rocky.  That would be an alternate route for those who can't do steep inclines and loose gravel"", ""Not a bad hike, the lakes are nice, and there are some other trails leading off further into the forest. We were there on a cloudy Wednesday so there weren't many other people, I think we saw only two other groups. The trail itself is extremely rocky and obviously doubles as a streambed, and it can be a bit hard to follow at the very beginning.\nThere were a few interesting things to see; lots of ducks in the lakes, the whole area is covered in glacial striations, and there is a nice overlook cliff 0.3 miles SSE of High Loch Leven, at 39.281795° -120.494094°, though you have to bushwhack to get there, try not to destroy the plants too much."", ""I'm not sure what the map marker for this trail is pointing to, but the Cherry Point I did was the one shown on the topo maps going from Middle Loch Leven Lake south to meet up with Big Granite trail at Four Horse Flat. I only hiked 1.2 miles out from the lake to check it out. The trail and route in general are not bad, there's a few nice views of each side of the ridge, but most of it is in forest. I noticed that it passes much closer to the summit of hill 6827 that it shows on the map.\n\nThe main problem is that the trail is not in good shape, it's overgrown with lots of small bushes and has many large fallen trees across it. It looks like the (apparently few) other people who have done it have also had a hard time following it as it frequently splits and converges, leads off to false trails, etc. It's not too hard to follow though, we were mostly able to guess the right way and make good time, just watch the cairns, and add more if you can. I'm guessing it gets worse beyond the point that we turned around, though."", 'Completed this hike in July on a Saturday afternoon, trail was busy but not a problem. Made it to the first and second lakes, both are beautiful. We wont do this trail again however because the trail is too rocky. This trail is an ankle buster.', 'The hike is relatively steep up to the 3 lakes. We took a 6 year old and an 11 year old, both active kids who did very well. It took us 2 hours to climb and I carried the younger child for 20% on my shoulders. We saw children who were carrying packs for overnight camping too. I loved the lakes. I brought swim trunks and swam around the 2nd lake which felt amazing after the climb on a hot summer day. Decent took us 1 hr, pretty fast and I ended up carrying the little one again for 15 mins but overall we all loved it.', ""The lakes are definitely worth the incline! It's about 2 hours to get up and an 1 1/2 hours back. This was my second time with my buddy going up and I have to say, we didn't learn our lesson the first time about packing lightly. We took our packs up with sleeping bags and food. Camping stove etc. first time we went we had 50 lbs pack now we had 30lbs. With weight it is a relentless hike. Steep and not for beginners. Without a pack it's a moderate hike and quite the day hike. High lake was not as great as I imagined. Small and windy and not very many places to set up camp. Mid lake in my opinion is the best. All in all, don't take too much and stay to the bare minimum. I'm very sore today so make sure you have a couple days to recuperate after. Goodluck!"", ""Hiked this trail early June with my 13 year old son, wife and yellow lab  Bella.  We started at the Big Bend trail head at about 11:00 a.m. and reached the middle Loch Leven Lake (2nd Lake) by 1:30.  The first mile of the trail is difficult to navigate as the trail is not clearly marked as you hike on glaciated rock formations.  So don't be in a rush and make sure you stay on trail.  The trail is a steady moderate climb from 5,600 to 6,800 foot elevation.  We stopped at the 2nd lake which is the largest of the three.  We spent hours here enjoying the spectacular beauty of this lake.  My wife went for a swim in the pristine waters, cold but refreshing.  Bella was in heaven fetching the stick from the lake.  We left the lake at 3:30 and made it back to Big Bend at 5:15.  I thought the hike was moderate in difficulty, my son an wife thought it was moderately difficult.  My only negative remark is that this is a busy trail."", 'Anyone do any fishing while they where there? If so let m e know how it was.', ""Beautiful hike. I would agree with the  moderate rating of this hike. There is one long steep uphill but the rest of the hike is fairly easy. The lakes are beautiful, definitely worth the extra mile or so to make it up to the 3rd lake. I can't wait to go back again."", ""I went with friends and this place is beautiful. I would totally swim in the lake but I can't swim."", ""First time I tried this hike I got lost and ended up spraining my ankle... not fun but my fault. Second time we found all 3 lakes and it was beautiful. The second lake was very popular for good reason. just pay attention to where you are going because it's easy to lose the trail but I noticed someone had small stacks of rocks here and there so you know you're going the right way. my grandfather used to fish here about thirty years ago. I love the views from the top."", ""We hiked and camped overnight at the upper lake several years ago with our daughter's Girl Scout Troop. A little complaining from them as the first part of the hike is a steady uphill trek but the end result is worth it."", 'Great trail!! The second lake is much prettier than the first! ', 'This trail is a freeway on summer weekends.  Hit it early season or on weekdays (though that is still pretty jammed).  Lakes are beautiful.  Options into the canyon or cross country east will get you more solitude, but if you take the first option it is a good climb back to the lakes.', 'Nice hike and good workout.  Some road noise for sure but it is beautiful.', 'I don\'t recommend this hike.  A relentless and often steep climb for 1 1/2 hours, all to the sound of rushing freeway traffic.  Trail not well marked over the granite portions.  The climb occurs over rocks large and small, and I saw someone on the trail trip and fall over the smaller ones.  Luckily I had a hiking pole.  The railway tracks reek of oil.  There is an extremely large tree blocking the path at one point, requiring some negotiation.  The climb lasts forever, and you must pay careful attention every step of the way - forget about admiring your surroundings.\n\nThe lakes are pleasant enough once you get there, and finally you can no longer hear the traffic along I-80.  But the effort of getting up there doesn\'t make it very rewarding.  And going down is no picnic either - hard on the knees.\n\nI was looking to ""get away from it all"" for half a day, willing to drive a few hours to get to the hike, and happy for some hiking challenges (40s, athletic, very fit).  But I think I can do a lot better than the Loch Leven Trail.', ""Done this one a number of times in pretty much all seasons.  It's definitely one of my favorite, relatively local hikes.  It is straight up for a bit, so it's a nice little work out.  And once to the top you'll find a couple of beautiful lakes that are aching to be swum in."", ""Did this hike with our 1 year old in the backpack in early June. We got a late start and it was a bit warm for us. We made it to the lower lake and there was a couple of groups there so we hiked another 15 minutes to middle lake and had it to ourselves, this was a fun hike and a good workout (lots of climbing). We met quite a few friendly people and dogs on the trail. You can see the parking lot just past the fire station. 4 stars because although the lakes were beautiful I've seen prettier clearer ones in the sierras. I will definitely do this hike again."", 'Great Hike! Did this hike in early June on a warm day but had a nice cooling breeze on the hike. Starting at the parking lot, you\'ll follow the trail that is NOT well marked into an area of mainly granite and you can easily loose the trail. A little work and you can find the trail again, if not just go up and you will run into the trail at the top of the granite. We had a light snow season last winter and therefore the trail was dry. But I could see since we hiked along many dry streams, that if it was a wet winter the trials would have been more challenging than they were. Since you’re in dry streams your hiking over many rocks from small ""ankle twisters"" to large stepping stones. This is a moderate hike that can make you think at times you should have tried harder on that stair master! But no worries, you\'ll get your work out here and you can skip the gym the next day. You\'ll see open beautiful views and walk through great pine forests. Lots of variety here! While passing (and getting passed) by fellow hikers, most seems to be ready to take a dip in one of the lakes. Also saw many backpackers on the trail that had apparently camped out over the weekend. Bring a hiking pole and plenty of water.', 'This hike will definitely get your heart pumping, but it is an amazing hike. Definitely worth the sweat. I thought the 2nd lake was by far the best. We took a break there & went swimming, & found some rocks 15-20 feet off the water to jump off of.  The 3rd lake has a neat little island you can swim to. Get out & do this hike!', 'Absolutely beautiful hike. Tried to come hike in September but found the trail far too busy for my taste. Came back in December with my husband and had a blast! The trail was snowy and iced over in some places but definitely negotiable with a good pair of boots and patience. Definitely worth heading out to during the off season.', ""Did this hike a few weeks ago, and enjoyed it!! There is some uphill hiking involved, but it's worth it once you get to the lakes!! Was a little challenging trying to make out the trail in the beginning, though.  Crossing the railroad tracks is kind of cool, though! All in all, it's a great hike!!"", 'Great hike, well marked, free parking, clean air and dog friendly. Very well travelled. The lakes are a sight to see after the uphill trek to get there. We were surprised to see how wet the trail was for the time of the season. 2hrs from Sacramento. ', ""I've done this trail a few times and always loved it. I've been up there with snow on the ground and lost the trail, but it's not a problem as you can see I-80 for the first part of the trail.\n\nThe lakes are beautiful and it's a nice long uphill hike getting up there.\n\nAs a bonus, you cross the railroad tracks. And if you wait a bit you'll probably get to see a train go by as you stand right next to the tracks. I found that a kind of thrilling experience.\n\nOn one trip in late summer there was a freak snowstorm. Pretty cool. \n\nThis is an awesome day hike!"", 'The lakes are great. Very busy trail. very rocky trailThe views are worth the hike. ', 'This was a wonderful hike. Had a great time. Take the extra few minutes to go to the High Loch Leven Lake. The first 1/4 mile or so were difficult in keeping on the trail. Scaling the granite outcroppings made it difficult to keep with the trail. Starting early assures that there will be few people on the trail. And, I want to go back to go camping one night as there are many secluded campsites with fire rings nestled around the lake. Be careful not to roll your ankles coming down with all the loose rock.', 'This is all up hill until you turn around and come back down.  I found some geocaches along the way. Had lunch at the furthest lake and then headed back.  You could camp up along the lakes in several spots, or take the trail out further in several directions.', 'I thought this was a beautiful trail, so accessible, and a perfect little day hike for when you need something easy, that won\'t take long, and gives you a lot of ""bang for your buck"". We had a hard time finding the beginning of the trail, but once you do, you\'re good. The best thing about this trail is that you get to swim in clean water, then warm up on a the rocks. ', ""Great hike mostly uphill however!  When you reach the train tracks you are about 1/3rd of the way.  Switch backs and rocky steep parts throught out.  The middle lake is the best for swimming.  Bring a lunch.  We have been hiking here for years, it can be busy on summer wknds.

Up to the camp the trail is pretty moderate after that it’s all incline and you will feel it. We arrived around 6:15 am and there was only about 4 parking spots left. Not sure about the overflow parking. On the weekends there is a cafe open at the top of Mt Wilson and there are restrooms as well.', 'First hike for the Six Pack of Peaks challenge and I loved it.

I did I two round in the lots then I was trying to find on the road and there was a nice guy pointing at his car that he’s leaving!

(My phone die on the way coming down, so there is no accuracy but I was glad that I made it to parking lot) Last couple of miles going up was tough. I kept stopping and looking up when this uphill/switchback end. I finished my entire 1.5l water going up so make sure you have enough water and snack to refill. Cosmic cafe save my life on summit. Going down from summit was confusing. There is no sign going down. I had to walk around the parking lot and observatory gate. There is a trail in the middle of parking lot. But again no sign!Downhill was easy but sandy and easy to slide so be careful. At the white creek ? Trail sprit and I had no strength to go uphill at the beginning of trail, so I went right to chantry flat for another 3 miles. Going up and down, there is plenty of gnat and mosquitoes. Be sure to spray bug spray everywhere and I saw a sign that there is a bear so maybe bring a bear bell. I saw a deer family running by me and looking at me so it was a delightful moment and that it self made my day.', 'Excellent training hike - I took the loop via Stuyvesant camp to the top and returning on the opposite side. 1st thee+ miles felt great - I started early to avoid the heat (6:00am) and bugs. Once I passed Stuyvesant though the uphill kicked in. There is some serious uphill for 3 miles so be prepared for a long slog. The observatories, exhibits and cafe were a welcome respite while preparing for the descent. The descent is tough - what goes up steep will come down steep so pace yourself.My GPS unit had me at 15 miles and I spent a little over 7 hours on the hike (3 hrs up, 2 1/4 hr down and about 1.5 hrs trying to recover at the top and during the steep switchbacks). Key is to pace yourself and just keep moving.Because of the lower elevation, heat will play a bigger factor so watch out - the downhill was interminable but the last 1/2 mile climb to the parking lot in 93+ degree heat was rough when your tired and ready to be done lolLeaving early helped minimize the bugs while the afternoon sleep also seemed to have tempered them. I really only saw the gnats and they were less than many other trailsOverall excellent hike that let me know I had done some hiking! Be proud of your accomplishment', 'Great hike! However, like previous reviews stated it’s more that 12.6 miles. My fitness watch doc’d it as 17. 7 miles. Cafe at observatory was a lifesaver.

Re-fueled at Stuyvesant (sp?) camp.   Going got tougher after that with steep switchbacks,   Got to the top in a little over 3 hours.   Low cloud made it a complete whiteout unfortunately - and it was COLD!   A bowl of chili at the Cosmic Cafe warmed things up.The way down was much easier but interminable!  The only time I had any concerns was at around 12 miles where the trail split and the sign was confusing.   Apparently both options take you back to Chantry Flats.  I took right (upper winter creek I think).   A climb initially by then flat until the descent to Chantry Falls.

We ended up doing about 18 miles of hiking.  Very very challenging.  This was the first of our six, lowest in elevation, but one of the toughest as incline.  The last 3 miles going up is lots of switchbacks and steep, narrow trail.  Loved the following the creek almost all the way up.  It did rain throughout our hike,  but the tree acted as a nice umbrella for us.  Cold once we got to the peak and our body temps started to cool down as we rested.  Loved the Cafe on top, nice lunch and headed back down.

It became steep after Spruce Grove Campground. The shaded, foggy trail kept me cool...making the uphill trudge more bearable. I loved reaching the top and going to the lookout area immediately to the right when you summit. You will find the elevation/Mt. Wilson sign there. After that, a trip to the Cosmic Cafe for some tasty food is a well earned treat.I thought I got off trail on the way down.  I would recommend getting the map at the little store at Chantry Flats. It includes the locations of all  the campgrounds, call boxes, river crossings, etc. and can be helpful when your electronic devices don’t work.  My phone tracked this hike as a 17.5 miler...but that includes my doubling back when I thought I had gone off the trail I was supposed to be on AND  getting to my car parked a ways from the trailhead. If I can do it, you probably can too!', 'Did this route counter clockwise.  It’s not 12.6 miles, more like 17.5 from our car at chantry flats.  Beautiful hike up & down.

Plus it takes pretty much all day anyway to hike it. restrooms at the trail head. Need Adventure pass (available at trailhead) or National parks pass to park or you will get ticketed. Let me just say, I was so impressed with the accommodations at the top! Actual bathrooms, running (hot!) water, a cafe with fresh hot food, coffee, plenty of seating-- such a great stop for lunch, I wish I brought money for coffee or something! A bit bummed we didn't take a picture with the sign, I couldn't find it. A bunch of cool camping spots on the way up, offering both cabin lodging or regular tent camping spots, might go back for camping some time. Folks at one of the cabins even offered us coffee and let us meet and greet with their puppers! I would recommend bringing bear spray-- although we didn't see any on our hike, we did see evidence of them, and they have been spotted frequently. Also bug spray, it got a bit buggy towards the end but not super horrible. TONS of poison oak lining the trail, so be mindful. Shaded most of the way and still went through 3 liters of water. Great views from the top, neat little places to check out along the way (including a tree swing, volleyball court, archery etc at one of the camping spots), beautiful waterfalls as an added bonus :)"", 'Hiked to the summit Thursday, April 12, 2018 on a beautiful clear day.  Three of us went up Winter Creek Trail to the top and then down Sturtevant trail and connected with Gabrileno Trail (meets this trail at the Sturtevant campsite) back to Chantry Flats.   The full loop was 13.75 miles of which the last 1/2 mile was a fairly steep (albeit on a paved road) climb which was a bit of a kick in the teeth after going that distance and being an Illinois flat lander!   At first having reached the summit I was like “I wouldn’t rate this a hard climb” but after finishing the full loop I would concur that it is a hard level hike due to the length and unless you are used to hiking long distances don’t take it lightly.   Great views from the “bench” which you reach at about the 5 mile point on the way up.   We could see all the way to the coast and great perspective of Los Angeles.This was our first of the Six pack we hope to achieve over the next couple years while our son goes to school out in SoCal!Great time of year to go I guess as we had no gnats or flies (which apparently are a big issue on the hike later in the summer).', 'Great hike.  Steep from Sturtevant Camp to just past 1/2 way rest area.   Cosmic Cafe for food open weekends.  Great scenery.  Mostly shaded.    Very busy from Chantry Flat to Sturtevant Falls but not bad after.

There is good tree cover and there are a few places along the trail where it's easy to take a wrong turn, so I'd recommend paying close attention.  The observatory and cosmic cafe at the top are fun features.  If you're in the mood for seclusion, this may not be the hike for you, but if you're feeling like a mountaintop banana split, then go for it."", ""I did this hike today and my biggest tip is be prepared. If it's in the winter or not even entered spring, bring a snow jacket because it is COLD and possibly snowing at the top of the mountain. Bring food, electrolytes, enough water, hiking poles (it DOES help), and maps. \n\nI would definitely take screenshots on ways to get up to the mountain and down the mountain, it helped so much when my friend and I missed some turns. If a beginner went on this hike, I'd start early. We started close to 8 and it still took us about 7 hours, not counting the hour we spent at the summit. The difficulty of this hike is high because of the TIME it takes to complete it. Like it's JUST long. SO long... I didn't experience any bugs at all, but there are PLENTY of poison oak at the beginning of the hike, so wear long sleeve and pants. I feel very proud to have completed this because it is a challenge."", 'This trail is a great long hike for beginners! It was for sure a challenge, but very doable and well populated.

Gets pretty tough past Sturtevant   campgrounds especially carrying 40 lbs of weight backpacking.', 'Awesome no bugs right now', ""It was a really intense hike. The waterfall at the beginning wasn't worth the extra mile. All the buildings on the first and last mile were kind of creepy walking alone in the woods (I'm guessing they're all rented out and full of life in the summer but right now it feels like a scary movie). The views were nice, I feel like there are better ones in the area, though.\n\nI'm happy because I wanted something fairly challenging and definitely got that.

My girlfriend and I just completed this loop on an overnighter while backpacking. We camped at Spruce Grove camp. Amazing hike and beautiful views the whole way. Definitely bring trekking poles for this type of elevation gain. If you don’t have poles you can rent them at adventure 16 for $7 the first day and $2 every additional day.  Also I read so many reviews about how terrible the bugs are on this hike. Let me say that we had no problems with bugs at all as we hiked the loop earlier this month (January). Cheers!', 'What a great hike. Long. 15.2 miles. Great elevation gain. Hiking poles are a must. Bring plenty of water.

This trail is a must!"", 'great hike! perfect way to spend Thanksgining.  although we were going to try to make it up to Zion, luckily a fellow hiker told us the sign located near the campground is wrong it says it is only 1.5 miles more.

', 'Rosa was visiting her family so I took our 8 year old son who had some difficulty but the snack bar at the top was worth it.', ""Be mindful that the directions for this trail lead you to the peak of Mt Wilson, meaning you hike down the mountain first, then back up. Also, the trailhead can only be accessed after 10 am, it's behind a locked gate until then, with no access. The views are beautiful and it's cool to see the equipment up on the mountain, the amount of flies ruined the hike for me."", ""Very strenuous hike but beautiful and serene. I took the Chantry Flats loop but took a side trail to Switzer falls before heading to Mt Wilson using the upper trail.  This was a very challenging hike given the steepness & elevation change.  Hiking poles a definite must have.  I thought I packed enough water but consumed every bit of the two liters with another half mile to get to the top.  The elevation change was a major factor as I was affected with altitude sickness which caused me to drink more water in order to avoid dehydration.  I began feelings leg & ankle cramps by the time I reached the top.  After a much needed break & late lunch I made sure to consume/pack excess water for the trek down.  I strongly recommend packing at least three liters of water to ensure staying hydrated. Next time I'll try the lower trail but will definitely be more prepared with at least three liters of water.  Also be advised, the mosquitos & gnats are relentless, you will be under attack the entire length of the trail.  Strongly encourage long sleeves, full pants, head/face net and/or bring some deet or Off to spray over your clothing if nothing else. Otherwise it will not be a fun trip. Happy trails."", ""Great hike! Lots a varied terrain and foliage.  Great views as you get to the top.  A lot of shade helps the temps, though it covers views as you head up, but I'll take that trade! Saw several deer at Spruce Grove camp. It was way too hot (90+) when I went, but otherwise is a manageable hike.  No joke about the bugs. Bring a head net and forget worrying about how it looks.  I gave five stars for doing this when it's NOT 95 degrees."", 'The bugs really took away from the fun of the hike. Enjoyed the first and last few miles along the creek.

Bring lots of water, bug spray and sunscreen.', 'Hike was great except for the bugs!  We fought swarming gnatlike bugs all day. Insect repellent had no effect, as bugs would not land or bite. They just swarmed around your face constantly. At times a face net would have been great.', 'After an attempt to summit here in March that had to be cut short, we decided to start early and give it a full go. We went counterclockwise, and got a treat of the stream and falls on the way up. I enjoyed the telescopes at the top, as well as logging benchmarks and finding some geocaches. Then the hike down the familiar route taken in March got us back with plenty of daylight to spare.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/2-L6wz4weEs', ""This is a challenging hike and the day we did it was the hottest day in So Cal this year.  The amount of bugs on the way up were insane.   There was a good 3 miles of continuously swatting them away from my face.  We only stopped once about 4 miles in and only for a couple minutes because we didn't want to get slaughtered by the bugs.  Very cool streams and waterfalls and the hike is shaded by trees the whole time.  I'm glad I did it but felt reaching the top was uninspiring.  This one was more like a exercise in self torture with no great views at the top.  Definately go in cooler weather."", ""Great hike! Bug repellent was definitely not enough for the amount of bugs you will encounter. The hike up is mostly shaded, and pretty easy to follow with great signs leading the way. The last 2 miles or so of switchbacks were definitely a killer, but aside from that, the hike was pretty doable. We took the old toll road down and there wasn't many shaded areas so a hat and sunscreen are highly recommended. If you have bad knees or bad ankles, trekking pole will help greatly. There is a little cafe at the summit which is only open on the weekends. And there are bathrooms and places to fill your water on top. Get there early to get a good parking spot!"", ""No parking at the trailhead by 6:50, had to park 0.8 mi down the road. Lower part of the trail was packed, but closer to the summit there weren't many people. Got eaten alive by bugs (20 bites on one leg, through leggings), and it didn't seem like it was just mosquitos, someone mentioned that there are horseflies in June. Cafe at the top had good food, but staying at the top for an hour definitely made the hike feel dragged out. The loop I did (approach from the east, descent along the west) kept us in the shade for a good portion of the hike, especially on the ascent. I remember doing this hike maybe four years ago and being eaten alive by bugs and then deciding to never do it again. I had forgotten just how bad it was, and I did it as the first of the six-pack series this year. The views were gorgeous but I probably will opt to not hike it again for another four years, since I prefer hiking at elevation to big bites."", 'Beautiful hike, but horrible bugs!', ""These trails are the prettiest in the L.A. National Forrest.  However, they are also home to some of the thickest swarms of gnats, biting flies and mosquitoes I've experienced in California.  DEET will NOT protect you.  Long sleeves , gloves, pants and head nets if you plan on going to the summit.  Or, do what I did, and just wave your arms all the way to the top like a lunatic.  The final leg has little shade and no streams to refill water until you get to the Observatories at the summit."", ""I did this trail as an out-and-back from Chantry Flat to Mt.

The weather was perfect for the day and I never got hot as most of the hike is done in the shade. The first few miles are quite pleasant, meandering along a nicely forest stream. I took the detour to the Sturtevant Falls which was defintely worth the extra 20-30 minutes. The ascent was difficult for the middle 2 or 3 miles but defintely manageable. Unfortunately there was a lot of cloud coverage when I went so I couldn't look out over LA but it was cool trekking above the clouds. The only time I wish I had poles was on the descent to take some pressure off my knees. Otherwise keep on the look out for mountain bikers and keep hydrated and you should be fine.

We saw two going up Chantry Flats and one was a big ol rattler sunning on the trail. Protect yourself and your dogs! After the camp, the last three miles were pretty tough! A couple washed out gravel areas that made me a little uneasy but overall not a bad ascent.

The last three miles of the ascent going up to Mt Wilson peak from the lower side is brutal. Trekking poles made the hike up and down easier. Especially during the light creek crossings when I was running out of gas. Not much parking available so get there early, or get stuck walking uphill for a mile. Not a fun walk when your legs are shot. There was plenty of bathrooms available on the lower trail side but when you climb down on the upper side trail, they don't exist, at least I didn't see any.

Also lots of little newts to make friends with along the trail sides by the creek. So watch your feet or your may step on one by accident. Ascending to the peak was difficult to say the least, so make sure you have lots of water with you. I would recommend a camelbak since they hold more.

Well basically, I\'ve hiked most of the 6 but never did Mt Wilson (the easiest), so this Saturday I did that. It\'s about 14 miles round trip, we finished in about 7 hours with some breaks. Super fun, more beautiful than I expected to be honest. For some reason I though it would be pretty easy and but drab. In fact it\'s actually fairly tough and the views are fantastic.

The trail is cool in the morning, and mostly shaded and through trees and woods.  A few small sections are exposed and have a ""desert feel"" to them.  GOOD NEWS: the water refill at Mount WIlson is up and running as of this post.  \n\nWe did this hike as the first of the ""six pack of peaks"" and found it challenging and rewarding.

Take keys or anything that'll help you be a little louder. There were 3 in our area yesterday including a cub which can be dangerous. The bright side to this hike is that most of it is very shaded until you get closer to the peak. The views are nice once you are up there but there is no plaque to take a picture next to. You will end at the observatory and Cosmic Cafe which is nice since its shaded, has tables and clean restrooms! We did the loop which took us about 9.5 hours total including an hour of rest at the peak. It all depends on your fitness level obviously. We were a slower/ steady group.

We weren't in good enough shape to check out the spur off to the falls the next morning, but we will probably go back to do it by staying at Spruce Grove again, but not doing the peak.

The lot fills up fast! Luckily I invested in an adventure pass last September.  I stepped off at 0635 from Chantry Flats and hiked to Sturtevant Falls (about 1.8 miles) before back tracking and completing the loop. The entire hike for me was 14.28 miles and it took me 6 hours 8 minutes (not including a 30 minute lunch break at the top). I underestimated how hard this distance, with the elevation gain (about 4200 feet), would be. I lost my legs at about the 5.5 mile mark and slowed down drastically. I found my legs again at about 6 miles when I caught my second wind, but that was short lived. With about 2 or 3 tenths of a mile to go, I hit a wall and slowed again. As the narrative says, the peak is a bit anticlimactic. Going down was fast and fun. I stopped and took lots of photos. I even got some great pictures of San Gorgonio, San Jacinto, and Mt Baldy.

I didn't know they had primitive camps along the trail, they are only 3.5 miles from the trailhead, so it would be perfect for the kids. The switchbacks were killer and I was able to try out my new trekking poles. I used to think trekking poles were for old people, but they are awesome.....maybe Im getting old, I don't know. I took a rest after passing the Sturtevant Falls camp and my pouch with my phone, compass, map and GUMMY BEARS fell off my pack and proceeded take a 60 foot tumble down a ravine to the rocks below. Everything survived but my phone, so I am currently trying to get all the pics off of it. The rest of the hike went well and I hit the peak at 10:30am.  The hike down wasn't as nice at first, but once you get to the multiple creek crossings things get nice and lush, I'd have to say that the Hoegee Campground was my favorite section of the hike.

If you are doing the loop, head west out the road from the snack shack and parking lot and once you exit the observatory entrance gate, immediately go to the left and head through that small gate that has surveillance cameras and a tiny dirt road... That is the toll road... Follow that down maybe 1.5 miles or less till you see a trail to your left... Head down there and you will head down to the upper and lower winter creek trails and you then have about 5 miles till you are back at chantry flats.

The weather was pleasant on the ascent, once we arrived at the bench where this trail and the Mt. Wilson trail meet, we were hiking in the clouds until we reached the summit. I took a short detour to Harvard peak and there was almost zero visibility. Once we reached Mt.

Just about a quarter size amount, didn't think to much of it. Middle of the night a welt had puffed up on my rear end right where the sap was on my trousers. Y'all know this girl immediately grabbed the dish soap n took the coldest shower known to man. It itches like a fleas on a dog so putting two n two together I'm sayin it equals some kind of poison oak.

Absolutely fantastic! The entire trail has great shade coverage. The day we hiked it was about 80 degrees but under the tree canopy it was perfect, I was even a tad bit chilly. Word to the wise, I would recommend hiking poles to save your legs a bit. We went without and wish we hadn't. Get there early the parking lot is small and fills early by 7! There is an over flow lot at the pack station that opens at 8 and cost $10. We parked a ways down the grade off the road which made for a longer day.

Lot was full at 7:00 am, get there early to beat the crowds.', ""I started out from Chantry Flats but didn't quite do the loop trip, although I was inspired to try it next time for sure!! Instead I set out on Gabrielino trail with a meet up group and set out to do the Sturtevant trail up to Mt Wilson.  Then came down the same way via Upper Winter Creek trail to avoid the climb UP the ROAD….It was sunny and warm on Mt Wilson but most of this hike is shady"", 'One of the best routes to take to Mt. Wilson during the summer with most of the trail in the shade.  I take this trail about once a month and it can be a busy on the weekends.  Not too steep but a steady climb once past the falls.  Parking on the weekends is tough if you get a late start.', ""Started from Chantry Flats. Took it all the way up.  Awesome views, scenery, and challenging trails.  Wish the mountain was higher.  Only came across  few hikers throughout the entire 14 mile treck.  Go with a buddy.  It'll make the hike/trailrun much funner.  The weather was good. Shaded almost the entire way."", 'My friend and I started the hike at 7am from chantry flats up to mt. wilson and looped down to mt. wilson toll road. We were supposed to get onto the winter creek trail, but missed it. Nonetheless, it was a great hike.  It took us all day (5pm) to get down and ended up in Altadena. \nOnce your up there, there are tv towers, a museum, and cafe to rest and enjoy the scenery. It was pretty awesome. "" I conquered mt. wilson!""', 'THis is a nice hike amid trees and by streams. I love hiking in this area. There can be bugs so I try to avoid the area in mid summer. It has a lot of ups and downs with some very challenging climbs', ""Pretty cool hike. It kind of kicked my butt. My knees were killing on the way down. I'll probably take polls next time. Checked out the Cosmic Cafe at the top. I had a hot dog because I'm an idiot. "", 'Awesome hike.  My buddy and I took the route that has you run up Mount Zion (3575’) on your way up to Mount Wilson and then we looped around the Mt. Wilson Trail to the Manzanita trail then to the Upper Winter Creek Trail.  Overall it took us about 5 hours to get to the top and about 2.5 hours down (we aren’t exactly in prime hiking condition either).  We chose that route because we did not want to hike up the dreaded paved road at the end.  We went on a Wednesday and I think we may have ran into other hikers maybe 4 times and all that was before Hoegees camp.  After that was total seclusion for the rest of the hike.  I would suggest getting their early and hike during the week.', ""Made this hike on a cool, sunny Thursday in June. Began the hike by mid-morning and headed towards the falls. The trail was busy and the falls had a couple dozen people hanging out. From there on to Mt Wilson the trail was very light in traffic. It is a strenuous hike for the most part though I found the worst of it is at the end when you hit the pavement and it seems like you have to hike back forever and a day to get back to the parking lot. I thought I'd be back in at 6 1/2  hours but that last hill made it 7 hours. Didn't see much wildlife this time out. I went through all 4 1/2 liters of water this time out. I enjoy this hike because of the scenery and  the shade provided along the way. there are several campgrounds and picnic areas along the way to stop and rest. I do wish people would remember to pack out their trash and dog poop."", ""Fantastic hike! It was pretty brutal though...still recovering. My boyfriend and I ran into a huge Mountain Lion on the way down. He didn't seem to care we were there, but we were pretty freaked out by it. Eventually he moved off and we got the heck out of there. This was on the trail back to Chantry Flats, shortly after the bench. We ended up doing this hike in just under 4.5 hours. We are really fast hikers anyway, but I think seeing that big cat shaved off a bit more time!"", ""Like Mark said in the previous review, this is a seriously scenic trail. Shaded almost the entire way, it makes its way through forests that showcase what it was that drew everyone into these mountains 120 years ago. It's a steady climb past Spruce Grove campground, but it pays dividends in views at the top. Winter Creek back to Chantry Flats is a steady descent; it spits you out at the footbridge you originally crossed starting out. Of course, that means one last, steep climb back up the paved road. Worth it. "", ""Great hike. One of the best in Southern California. The trails are what make the hike. The views are awesome but this trail's right hook is the consistent beauty of the path along the way.\n\nThe trails are well maintained and well marked. There's even a cafe at the summit open part of the year. I had read that Chantry Flats was the best way up to Mount Wilson and I think you'd be hard pressed to find a more scenic route although I cannot claim this from personal experience. I'd note Sturtevant Falls... but that's just a tease. It only gets better from there.\n\nWe were lucky enough to hit the trail with a ton of snow on the ground. Pretty awesome in Southern California at such a low altitude. It felt like we were at a significantly higher altitude.\n\nI don't think the difficulty is quite as hard as it is rated. While it is a long hike, it's nothing that's going cause problems for the average Joe... as long as you've gotten a few moderate hikes under your belt.\n\nYou can knock it out in 6 hours hiking non-stop. 7 hours taking breaks. 8-9 if you take long breaks and/or stop to take all the scenery in (or take pictures). 10 for turtles.\n\nJust go."", 'This is a very difficult hike, but this route is very beautiful. You are shaded by trees throughout the hike except at the summit. The scenery is almost like your in a jungle/forest. Very easy to follow trail because of the all the trail signs.  Trails are very well maintained.

I was able to see some awesome breed of dogs.... it’s funny because we came on this hike by mistake trying to see the caves on the Bronson hike (something like that).I recommend WORKOUT gear. I saw a lot of people that might have missed that memo and ended up sliding and falling. Be sure to have a shoe that has a grip to it! Take water...don’t make the mistake I made. There is horse poop everywhere (lol) soooo look where you are going. Great little places to take photos. But this trail is connected to many other trails that will take you to the Hollywood sign. Oh! PARKING! Keep DRIVING ALL THE WAY UP. There is parking all the way at the beginning of the trails so do not stop at the first gate!Enjoy folks!', 'Great hike!  It was a beautiful day in LA.  Started early to beat the crowds and to get a good parking spot. Took my uncle visiting from Minnesota.  A must for out of town guests.', 'We have been doing Runyon Canyon because we live on an easy access block.  Every once in a while we need change the scenery so we drive 15 minutes and do something touristy and easy for us to get off the bucket.   This hike is everything that is described in the description as far as we are concerned as locals.  Very enjoyable.', 'Great hike. Come early!!', 'It was a nice trail. I set out at 7:30 a.m and finished it in 2 hours. Carry water and sunscreen!', 'This was a relatively easy trail to the Hollywood sign. The hardest part about this trail is that it is straight up to get to the Hollywood sign. I started from the Canyon Road parking lot and went to the back of the sign first and then the front of the sign. In total that was 7.5 miles. If you only go to the front of the sign it is 5.7 miles. Listen to what everyone else says -go out super early, there is no shade. You’ll need sunblock, a hat, water and sturdy footwear. The ground is not technical at all, it’s a flat hard pack and actually at the very top its asphalt to the front of the sign.', ""Loved the hike! The views were amazing and I got great shots of the sign. It is dry and open trail but if done in the early morning it's not bad at all. Definitely bring apply sunscreen and wear hats and sunglasses. We didn't go all the way up behind the hike, but it isn't much further up the trail (maybe like another mile) if you decide to go further up."", 'Great hike - and easy for kids.', 'This was a fairly easy trail. Gradual incline. It’s really open so hats, sun screens, and at least a liter of water or more if you start late as it will get hotter in the afternoon. We spent about three hours total because we stopped at the Hollywood viewpoint ( front view of the sign) and Mt Lee ( back of the sign)  to take in the breathtaking views and for lots of pictures. There is no trail that will bring you right to the sign as it’s gated and in a protected area, however if you get onto Mt. Lee trail it’ll get you to Mt. Lee just behind the Hollywood sign and it’s as close to it as you could get to the sign. Hope this help, have fun!!!', 'This is a great adventure.. you need to have good shoes lots of dust and water. We saw rattle snakes so no flip flops...', 'Great moderate hike to bring out of town guests. However, if out of shape, it may be difficult. It’s up hill at beginning and end.', 'Great views. Would be great at sunset or early morning.', 'It’s a nice hike but nothing spectacular. The smell of horse poop and pee can be a little overwhelming from sunset ranch. There is no shade so avoid on hot days.The view at the top is fantastic however. Amazing views of the Hollywood Reservoir and the view of the back of the Hollywood sign is certainly unique!', 'Great hike just watch out for the horse poop. minimal shade.', 'This trail is filled with horse crap and is absolutely disgusting. Horse tour companies should be responsible and pick up the horse crap. Dog owners must so why cant a paid business giving tours do it. I would never recommend this trail to anyone, unless you want to fight flies, nat, and dodge horsecrap the whole time. the smell is not enjoyable either. hike at your own risk!!! only giving 1 star because I have to. the city needs to make these horse tourist responsible.', 'great trail, amazing views and cold drinks available once you reach the top via the tank trail...', ""Nice and easy hike up to and behind the Hollywood sign.  Trail is more of a smooth dirt road and the presence of tire tracks indicates this.  Went in January and it wasn't crowded and the temps were very 'normal', not too hot and not too cool.  Sunset on the way back down was amazing!"", 'This is the best trail to get in front of the Hollywood Sign!! You can also go to the observatory once you are up in the trail. The hardest part is finding parking and then you are off. No bathrooms on the way. I went during the heat of the day, I took my liter water bottle. It took me 2 hours total while I stopped for lots of pictures. If you bring your dog, don’t forget WATER for them!! I saw so many people with large dogs, husky’s in 90 degree weather.... one collapsed... it’s hot on their feet too and they can suffer heat stroke!! Anyways sorry about my dog rant, there is a nice breeze and the beginning starts out with lots of shade and then it opens into a dirt road for truck access. You will see horses on the trail if you are lucky; I also saw a man and his goat. There are trash bins in the area which was nice. The Bronson park opens at sunrise and closes at sunset so keep that in mind. My recommendation is to go early in the morning and bring a small car for parking. I would also wear a hat that has flaps on the back and sides for those that have sensitive skin, sunscreen and bring a little nap sack so you are hands free.', 'Great trail! Amazing views!! Bring a lot of water & wear a hat :)', 'great hike! Bring water, sunglasses & a hat.', 'This was wonderful!', ""Less of a trail and more of a wide dirt road. No shade, so bring a hat and plenty of water. Views of the city are stunning, but there isn't much else by way of pretty nature photo ops. Loved being able to go to the front and around behind the Hollywood sign, but doing both does add extra mileage, so be prepared. Iconic views from the sign itself. So glad I did this at least once. (And it only took 20 years of living here!)"", 'I love this hike!! Bring at least two liters of water and a snack. This hike was 6.9 miles for me because I also went to Bronson cave and I recorded from the time I exited my car until I got back. It is an all uphill hike so go slow and steady. Wear a hat and put on sun screen. Enjoy!!', 'Amazing trip, hike is tough, lots of uphill, all the time and a fairly steep incline. Took a few hours. The payoff at the end is worth it!', 'Amazing!!!', 'Great hike!', 'Love the views of the Citi... And the Hollywood sign.. Pretty traffic during the weekend.. Good workout not to steep for beginners.. Bring water n hat...', 'Step drop-offs and some climbing but great hike, excellent views from the Wisdom tree.', 'Fun hike..very hot on a sunny day. Majority of the trail was not shaded. Prepare to bring a hat, sunblock, and plenty of water. I would recommend to start earlier in the day. Enjoy!', 'Take Franklin Ave to Canyon Dr. go north. Plenty of parking along Canyon if parking lot at trail head is full. Took 4 kids, all 11 and under. Great family hike with views of the city.', 'Parking fills up quickly off Canyon Drive, wide dusty trail with options to go in front of Hollywood sign or behind it or to Griffith Observatory, all are worth exploring.  Beautiful views on the way, especially from the very top.  Bring enough water, Rangers do provide water buckets around half way point depending on time of day', 'Dirty, dusty, windy and hot. But the views are awesome. Went on a Thursday afternoon, not crowded at all. Watch out for horse crap, bc there was a ton of it. Good steady climb and felt a sense of accomplishment looking DOWN on those letters knowing how far above they were at the start. Glad I did it, but won’t be back.', '', ""Lovely views and lots of photos ops!

Great leg and butt workout! Great view at the top!"", 'Easy hike with some amazing views', ""There isn't much shade so it can be hard work climbing up the trail. Definitely worth it for the views."", 'Tough hike in the beginning as it is steep and there is absolutely zero shade. Make sure to bring plenty of water.', 'Good hike. Starts off steep. Go around 4ish and you get the cool walk on your way down', 'Finally made it! Went last weekend with two friends and we got incredible views and photos! Can check it off my bucket list!', 'I loved this trail. Lots of options for paths. You can even hike to the observatory. Great views. Would do again', 'As expected, great hike about 10 miles, long but easy hike that includes great LA views', 'Busy busy trail. Nice view of Great Los Angeles area. Not recommend to do after 9 a.m. cuz there is no shade and will be very very hot. Pretty good trail for beginners, not so steep, wide trail.', ""This is the 3rd trail I've done and it was a little hard for me but well worth it. It felt good to finally see the Hollywood sign."", ""This trail was a bucket list item for my 19 yr old daughter.  Pretty phenomenal.  Busy, BUSY trail.  Parked in a neighborhood below sign and walked at least a mile (uphill) just to get to trailhead.  Trailhead is manned by a security guard who fields questions and keeps an eye out for ne'er-do-wells.  Took my Doberman puppy up -- his first big hike.  It kicked his butt.  No bathrooms, no water.  No shade.  Wide area to hike -- a road really.  Great views of the LA smog.  ;-)"", 'Despite different website claims, we parked on Beechwood (no time limit, lots of open spots but no parking Fridays-Sundays) and walked up. There is a guard posted at the top of Beachwood Drive. Beyond the guard is a public access gate that was open. Regular locals access the gate for access to Griffith and the Hollywood sign. Moderately steep incline on some slippery gravel to the Sunset Ranch sign and the trail to the Hollywood sign starts to the right just before the Sunset Ranch sign. The rest of the trail clearly marked. The rest of he trail is a mixture of moderate inclines and flat ground. Bring water!', ""Its great hiking however going back down didn't we didn't make the right turn and end up at wrong place but it was overall it fun"", 'So this is a drag, but the city just announced that the trail to the Hollywood Sign can no longer be accessed from N Beachwood Drive starting April 18.  They are permanently locking the gate. ;-(', ""The directions on here will get you to the area but really you need to start at Los Angeles River Park. you can park next to it and hike from there. it's about a 1.5 hour hike just walking. you have to pass the do not enter signs but once ya get to the trail (about 20 mins in) it's a easy route to follow. Great Views!"", 'Not too long. But steep. Definitely a workout for the lungs. Almost no shady areas, so prepare for sun. Went on a Friday.

Also like that there's 2 different trails. One to look directly at it, and one to go above and look down at it."", 'Beautiful views! Great workout but not too steep. Really enjoyed this hike. It was longer for me because I started at the bottom of the Cauheunga loop trail and worked my way up.', 'Pretty good trail. With the exception of making sure you have to park in a zone that does not require a permit. Last thing you need after a beautiful day and a hike is to come back to your car with a parking ticket or worse, towed.', 'Great Hike but Moderate plus due to the incline. I saw a lot of people just quit and turn around. Parking is tough we got lucky that someone was leaving when we arrived. Great Views, good for Pics. No shade, so wear your Sunblock', 'As a hike, so-so. Lots of people, even mid-week in November. Of course, the real reason is to get to the Hollywood sign... but even then the closest you can get is about 100 ft, due to fences (with lots of security cameras). It was a very hazy day too, maybe better views on a nice day.', ""So, I would call this borderline moderate.  Cool view but pretty steep!  No weekend parking so that's a drag and some of the locals are a--holes.  My g.f.s and I were walking up the street talking but not making too much noise and this woman comes out of her house and tells us to get the f--- away from her house.    A couple of weeks later I tried hiking to the sign from Canyon Drive north of Franklin Ave near the big Gelsons on the corner.  Tons of parking on Canyon past the gate and in a dirt lot.  The hike was  maybe 10 minutes longer, but not as steep.  Also water and decent rest rooms that were pretty clean and no screaming residents.  After we went to the Trails Cafe on Fern Dell nearby."", '', ""Awesome hike. It's actually pretty difficult as it's all uphill. I'd say the first 20% of the hike is hard as the incline's the steepest but if you battle through it it's pretty awesome and it evens out a little. The views behind the Hollywood sign are really cool!"", 'Love this hike. Its not too steep and the views are beautiful. There is not a lot of shade so it can get pretty hot.', ""I found this to be a difficult hike for my being mostly uphill. The views were definitely worth it though. I got to be so close to the Hollywood sign and there weren't a lot of other people there"", 'If you approach up the Beachwood Canyon entrance, there is no parking on the weekend on the streets for about 3/4 mile leading up to the trailhead.  Agressively enforced! The trail itself is wide and well traveled, pretty gradual incline.  Lots of people coming from other trails in the park.  Upper half of the trail is blacktop.  Great views of both Hollywood and the Valley and of course the iconic sign.', ""Make sure to bring sun screen and water. Also be prepared with the type of clothing you wearing and don't forget to wear hiking shoes. Most of the hike is uphill. On the other hand it has amazing views of Griffith Observatory, Downtown LA,  and the Hollywood sign. I personally enjoyed the hike."", 'Fun time, took my son so we could check out our legendary Hollywood sign!', 'Nice views', ""Well, I got lost and decided to just wonder around and look at the different houses. I hate stairs so I'm glad I got lost and got to explore the neighborhood. It would be better if the stairs were easier to find. I would not consider this an easy outing. I'm out of shape and I met some alethic women that were struggling like I was."", 'Butt kicker going up the summit', 'Amazing', 'awesome', 'Too easy for me!!!! But beautiful and fun to see how big hollywood sign is up close.', '2nd time and it was great!', ""I wish I could give this hike a real review but the directions if gives you to get there are wrong. Drive almost and hour and a half from home to go to this hike to get to the very top and the gates are chained up and it says no hiking access. Drive through this small neighborhood thinking we were getting closer to have to turn around and not be able to enter. Stop at a small grocery store near by to get directions and were told to go a different way and the same thing happen. Chained up gates and no access to the trails . Wasted a Saturday morning driving around and getting no where. Disappointing. If you want to give this a try don't follow the directions this app gives..."", 'This trail is not as ""easy"" as they claim.  Be prepared and bring water and sunscreen.  Also, make sure after the first big hill to keep left.  I went right and wound up almost at Griffith!  Took almost 4 hours, but I was determined to get to the top!  The view was worth it, but I won\'t be doing it again soon.', 'Great scenery. Crowded on a Sunday. Watch out for the horse poop.', ""Iconic! I'm born and raised in Southern California and just did this hike on 1.1.16. I waited way too long to make it up here! I would recommend it to anyone and everyone that can make it up the hill. We were lucky on our hike to have such gorgeous weather. We could literally see from OC to Long Beach to Catalina to Santa Monica on the south side and Bubank on the north side of the peak. It's a long uphill but worth it!"", ""This is a really easy hike - great for the whole family and to take out of towners to or to get outdoors for a fresh breath of air. As a fit person that works out about 4-5 days a week, I wouldn't recommend this hike if you're looking for a workout."", 'The hike itself is not too bad, suitable for all ages with a generous view over the city of Hollywood/Los Angeles area.', 'Awesome hike, easy paved road half way up, took my 9yr daughter she loved it.', 'Many back end staircase. It is very easy to get lost in between the houses. There are pretty neat houses in different styles from every corner.', 'easy hike. all paved road to the top.', 'One of my favorites!!', ""A friend took me and I don't remember the trail but it was the awesome trail of my life."", 'Bucket list check off!

Other than that, it is an all asphalt trail that leads to the top of the Hollywood sign. Beautiful view at the top.', ""I went hiking here in the beginning of december with a friend around 4pm. It happened to be a gloomy and cold day so we didn't have such a great view, but still able to see downtown la from the trail. We got to the top of the trail behind the hollywood sign and were just breath taken!! We came across a few horses along the way and very friendly people. By the time we came down it was already dark so we decided to run half the way. The view of the city lights is spectacular! I would definitely go back again.\n\nParking does get crowded during the day but we had no problem parking in the lot. \n\nLiving in LA County for 21 years and finally being able to hike to the Hollywood sign was definitely a day I'll never forget."", ""For me, it was a great experience coming up to the Hollywood sign since it is such a huge attraction. To the Hollywood sign in itself, follow the trail that will lead you to the back of the sign. If you are expecting to be very close to the sign where you can touch it & take pictures with it, you will be disappointed since there is a fence bordering it. Amazing views at the top! \nLot's of incline and horse poop, just a heads up!"", ""Most go if you're visiting Hollywood. There is a fork that splits for the front of the sign and a hike to the top behind the Hollywood sign. "", 'The entrance to the Trail is off of Beachwood Drive right by right next to Sunset Ranch. My girlfriends and I started hiking around 6:40 a.m.. We ended up doing both trails. One trail ends behind the sign and the other in front of the sign. There are inclines and declines during this hike. The trail to the right is a little more strenuous and ends up behind the sign.  There is a very nice memorial with a little bit of history regarding the trail and the donors who make the trail possible.', 'Smooth and flat road.

The high point of the hike was seeing a bald eagle!  We will be back to complete the loop.', 'Great hike but more like 5.7 miles from parking area. Even longer if you decide to take the detour out and back to Donner Peak from main trail up to  Mt. Judah. Beautiful views.', 'Nice views. Get to walk on some of the ski runs and good views of Sugar Bowl ski area.', 'We are new to hiking and in our 50’s-60, so this is for newbies like us. Loved the views and weather was perfect in October. We actually walked the path counter-clockwise, not knowing how this app really works, and just realized, late, that the path direction is on the app. Heading down the peek of Mt. Judah Trail back to Pacific Crest was slippery and steep, the trail was hard to recognize. Now that I see we should have ascended that way, it makes some sense. We’re learning and love adventure.', 'The first 2 miles could be challenging for people who have knees problems because the trail was steep and could be slippery. We hike relatively slow with our dogs and it took us about 3.5 hours round trip.', 'Great hike!', 'Very crowded and when I hike I like to get away from people. I’ve lived in Truckee since ‘91 and have never done this trail as I had heard it was too busy. Rocky parts and uphill but not a difficult hike. Beautiful views! 2 hours and 12 minutes to do entire loop.', '*There are some lengthy steep and rocky parts of the trail*Great workout*No water sources so bring plenty of water for dogs*A lot of exposed/unshaded areas of the trail*Took about 3.5 hours to complete the entire loop with several breaks*Well signed trail; hard to get lost*Nice views (lake, summit, trees, etc.)', 'Great! Especially hitting it just right for wildflowers!  Views are magnificent. Good workout.', 'Beautiful! Amazing views. Great hike with older kids.', 'A beautiful October hike, with saturated colors, cool temperatures, and no other hikers. Although a relatively short hike, the climb provides good exercise if done at a brisk pace.', 'Beautiful!  Good workout.  Fall colors beginning and great views.', 'beautiful views and amazing trail.', 'Pleasant beautiful loop, definitely go out to Donner point.', 'Great hike', 'Amazing views!', 'Loved it.  Beautiful views.  It’s a good work out for those that want to push it.  Or you could take it easy and enjoy the scenery.Took my daughter and I and we completed it in two hours.

Spectacular view of the lake!', 'Wow it was definitely 4 out of 5 stars', 'Great trail with outstanding views of lakes', 'Amazing views!', 'Nice mix of rocky path and forested trail, sun and shade.', 'It is about 6 miles total from the parking area. Very very rocky in the beginning. Almost impossible to run. It’s worth it as you get to the summit and then a great run back to the parking area. Running up to the summit is really hard at a high altitude! Beautiful area!', 'Amazing wild flowers end of June through July', 'The trail starts of fairly rocky and smoothed out again until you get closer to the top.  Very nice scenery throughout the hike.  View from the top is a nice payoff.  No water so bring what you’ll need plus food.  Did it in early July and saw lots of wild flowers.  Well marked.  Hard to get lost.  It took us three hours with stops.', 'This was a fun hike with a friend. Lots of great views and the weather was perfect since we live in the valley. Nice day trip to get out of the heat and get in some fun exercise. Would definitely do it again.', 'Great hike !', 'Beautiful hike!  Good workout. Stunning views.', 'Beautiful!', 'Great views of the lake, easy hike', 'Nice enough hike with some good views of the surrounding mountains.\n\nIt is a single file track for most of the trail so some basic trail etiquette would make this hike more enjoyable for everyone. But no such luck. Yielding to uphill traffic, packing out dog poop or even a simple ""hello"" seem to be altogether foreign concepts on this trail. We did this on a Monday when it was relatively quiet, I would definitely not do this on a weekend when lots of people compound the trail etiquette issue.\n\nThe notable pleasant exceptions to the above we encountered were PCT hikers and a handful of very friendly Europeans.\n\nWho this trail is for: people looking for a workout instead of their usual gym and do not care about hiking as such.\nWho this trail is not for: Anyone looking for inspiration or who enjoys hiking.  Keep looking elsewhere because you are not missing anything by skipping the Mount Judah Loop Trail.', 'Wonderful hike with beautiful views.  Fairly easy and steady climb up to Mt Judah.  We started at 6:30am to avoid the crowds and hot temperature.  There were a ton of mosquitoes at the trailhead so be sure to bring your bug spray.  Not much snow at the top (small patches here and there).  Highly recommend Mt Judah and maybe tacking on Donner Peak along the way!', 'Third time hiking this trail yesterday, June 22.  One of my favorites in Truckee - I’m a local.  Views are stellar. Started at 7 am as it was going to be a hot day.   Got very warm at the end.  The trail is sun exposed.   We had 3 dogs with us all in good shape and young but they went thru almost all our water.  Leaving the trail around 12 noon we ran into people just starting the hike (in the heat of the day) with a 13 1/2 year old dog.  Felt very, very sorry for the dog.  Asked if they need the rest of my water.  Said they had some by didn’t have a bowl.  I gave hem mine - which is a collapsible.   Folks: there is no water for the dogs on this trail and it gets very hot especially at the end when the dogs are tired already.  Please remember to bring lots of water for your dog.  And think about whether a 13 1/2 year old dog should even do this hike.  Hope he made it.', 'Busy trail, but definitely worth it.', 'Kind of technical first mile ascent, but great afterwards. Went last week and there was still significant snow! It was awesome! The top was super windy (50mph) to beware on windy days. There’s no coverage up there.', 'Warning! In order to cross Sugar Bowl terrain during their ski season, a uphill pass is required. Even with an uphill pass, only some uphill routes are approved and unfortunately this is not one of them. I ran into a ski patrol while attempting this trail and was turned around. They told me to visit Sugarbowl.com and read the uphill policy for more information.', 'Absolutely gorgeous! Park right off the highway as the road to the trail head is narrow and there is no closer parking. Trail was easy to follow the tracks until it crossed the ski runs.', 'It’s a good hike ,  very moderate- not to hard . Views are great.', 'We did the loop counterclockwise. Micro spikes were definitely in order on some of the lower parts and all of the upper. Once over the summit and past the ski lift, the backside was too steep and unstable to try. Getting late so we came down the ski area in the woods. Treacherous in spots but at least there were trees to stop you (which we did not need).', ""I do not recommend doing the full loop in the winter. The trails up to Donner Peak are of medium difficulty and were mostly easy enough to follow people's footprints with some GPS confirmation. They were mostly covered in snow and a bit of ice, so I would recommend bringing some kind of spikes or snowshoes. I think this section would be good as an out-and-back during the winter months. If you plan to go up any side of Mount Judah, I would definitely recommend crampons and maybe even an ice axe in the current conditions. Following my GPS, I accidentally found myself on the trail to the east that runs parallel to the ridge. The whole south and east sides of Judah are pretty icy and slick, with no easy tracks to follow if you don't count the deer footprints."", 'Didn’t do loop however still a great workout. Few patches of ice but you can walk around them ( by doing a little bit of bolder hoping) Once you get near the top snow shoes really help', 'We went November 18th. The mountain was covered in snow. Once we got to the top the trail was completely covered in snow so we just explored on our own and hiked back down under the ski lift. You will defiantly need snow shoes once you get to the top (we rented them for the week from rental shop where we live). If we didn’t have snowshoes and gps we probably would have turned around. The views are beautiful and the land that you can scale in snowshoes an awesome experience!', 'Took the hike early summer. Great hike all the way around', 'Great hike. Somewhat confusing junction after crossing over Judah when descending at PCT T-junction, not signed but take a right back toward sugar bowl to reach Donner Summit lot', 'We are not fond of the beginning (or end) portion of the trail which consists of rocky switchbacks on the face of the mountain but then it becomes a pretty reasonable trail. Lots of people and dogs. Beautiful scenery. Took us 3.5 hours but we are in our late 50s.', 'Beautiful hike. Moderate level. Would definitely do it again.', ""Great trail, first part is the most challenging. Great views at both Donner Peak and Mt Judah. Took about 2.5 hours (didn't stay at summit for long as it was very windy)."", 'Beautiful hike.  Some snow,Ice and mud.  The view at the top is amazing. It was a super cold day.   28 when we started.  SuperWindy at the summit but so worth it.', ""Great hike. Wonderful views from the top. Left at 9:00am on a Saturday. We didn't see a sole until the split and then only a couple until we reached the top. Saw lots on the way down. Parking was also full at that time 1:00. (We're really out of shape ☺) It was a great workout for us!"", 'Great round trip with some perfect trails for trail runners. Hi early though as this is a popular hike and gets super busy after 10am.', 'The begining of the trail is somewhat difficult as you walk on stones the loop after is easier, the slop is gently bringing you at 8200 feet, it is worth it for the view and different landscapes, our 10 years old, did it without a problem, even younger kids were able to do it, make sure you have the right equipment (shoes, water (there is not a lot of shades))', 'Absolutely beautiful views', ""Such a fulfilling hike. Please do not do when it is hot as it is mostly without shade. I met some amazing people.  Please complete if you are working towards a higher elevation. My fav couple was I am guessing in their 60's and they rocked it!  Love and Mother Nature rules! YOU can do it!"", 'The hike has beautiful views the whole way up, but the vista at the summit ridge is easily he highlight.', ""Beautiful views.  Took a detour and climbed the rocks to catch view of Donner Lake.   There's a box hidden under the granite rocks where you can leave a note to share your experience with the next hikers.  Getting to the top was a little challenging, but well worth the views.   Coming back down you get to see some spectacular terrain.  Make sure you don't miss the beautiful moss growing on the trees.   Pay attention to the forks in the trail towards the end of the loop, it can be tricky getting on the right trail.  We would definitely do it again."", 'Beautiful trail, not too far but enough for a good workout. Great morning trip!', 'Beautiful, diverse hike. Lots of hikers of all ages out today. Lots of sun, but storm clouds were just around the corner. Gradual incline and decline. I agree that this is moderate (more challenging than easy), but some with knee issues might find it difficult with lots of steeper granite steps.', 'Completed this hike on 8/16/17. Mt Judah loop is one of the most beautiful hike I have done this year. The scenery was filled with different types of natural scenery. There are beautiful rock formations and various types of flowers and trees. Moreover, there was snow on the trail we had to walk across. We started late around 10:30am and got to Mt. Judah by 1pm. Along the way to Mt. Judah, we also visited Donner Peak. Donner Peak overlooks Donner Lake which the view was spectacular(I like Donner Peak more than Mt. Judah). During our descent, it sprinkled hard. The weather around the summer is quite bipolar, so, wear water proof gears. Descent took a little over one hour. Overall, this hike offers beautiful views of nature. It might be tough during some part of the trail due to incline and rocky trails but the reward is large. Would do this hike again.', 'Great hike! Definitely on the harder end of moderate though as the climb is continuously uphill - be prepared with good shoes and lots of water!', ""Nice moderate hike great views! Also beautiful wild flowers this time of year! It's crazy that there are still patches of snow near the top"", 'You get a lot of bang for your buck!  Vistas, flowers, tall trees, this trail has it all!', 'great scenery and good distance', ""One of the best day hikes I've ever been on!  Amazing views, crazy amounts of wildflowers, some patches of snow.  Varying terrain keeps it interesting.  Highly recommend."", 'Beautiful trail! Well maintained and gorgeous views.', ""It's a short, alpine wilderness loop trail with lots of flowers and a couple nice spur trails along the way to little peaks. The trail isn't far from the interstate, and clearly popular but still quiet, especially after 5pm. The climbing is steady and not too difficult. I enjoyed being there and getting that exercise so much that I walked the loop twice, and got good and worn out, the best."", '01AUG17 Lower & mid-hike slopes & small meadows of beautiful wildflowers (""Spring"" in August)', 'The wildflowers were beautiful as was the  moss on the trees.  I recommend this trail if you like to go through woods and open fields.  The top has really nice views as well.  It was a bit crowded today but ppl were pleasant', ""Terrain: Rocky in sections, mostly soft dirt\nSun/Shade: Very exposed (it is above the tree line)\nViews: wildflowers (late summer), views of Tahoe National Forest and two lakes, beautiful rock formations\nDifficulty: 3/5 (5=Very strenuous)\nOverall rating: 4 stars\n\nI completed this loop in early August on an overcast day that brought some rain while on the trail. If you're considering this trail for the 2017 season, I'd suggest going very soon - the wildflowers are out in full bloom (see my pictures).\n\nThis is a beautiful trail that was full of wildflowers (if you time it right) and views of Tahoe National Forest, including Lake Mary and Donner Lake.  Along the trail, you'll see lots of interesting rock formations. \n\nI ascended on the Mount Judah Loop Trail, then came down on the PCT (as AllTrails suggests).  It is a relatively steep climb for a moderate hike, and much of it is on rocky terrain, and it is completely exposed to the elements. Since it rained earlier in the morning, and while I was on the trail, parts of the trail can be slick.  I brought hiking poles and mid-rise hiking boots.  My husband had trail shoes and no poles, but he's much fitter than I am.\n\nOnce you get past the initial climb, you have a choice for how you want to ascend to the peak: Mount Judah Loop or PCT.  We did the loop and hit a patch of snow on our way to the peak along the Mount Judah Loop - we had to walk around it. It was very doable, but it might have proven much more challenging a week or two earlier. That being said, we met fellow hikers that did not go over or around the snow because it was raining.  We did, and it was worth it to get to the peak, and the trail down along the PCT.  At the peak, it is pretty barren, but you have nice views of Tahoe National Forest. We ate lunch overlooking Donner Lake.  It was chilly, but well worth it.\n\nThe trail had a lot of wildflowers when we were there - it looked like a garden - pretty amazing at this altitude.  There is a small forested section with trees covered in lichen and moss.  There were more wildflowers and tree groves on the PCT side - this side of the mountain seems more protected.  \n\nThe trail is relatively exposed, so on a sunny day, you would definitely need sun protection and a hat.  I think only about 10-15% of the trail offers shade.  While I got rained on, it was still perfect weather for this trail that would undoubtedly feel very hot given the elevation, steep ascent at the beginning, and lack of tree cover.  \n\nBring sunblock, a hat, poles, and bug spray. While we didn't need big spray, it was a very cool day.  I'd do this hike as soon as you can after the snowmelt - then you're likely to enjoy the wildflowers."", ""Lots of nice wildflowers, and the snow at the top was easy to cross today July 30th.  The views from Donner Peak and Mount Judah are awesome!  If you're carrying a filter there is only one spot with snow runoff on the way up to refill, so plan accordingly & bring enough water.\nTraffic on the trail is pretty high, my only reason for deducting a star.  It's not the trail's fault, but all the groups of people did distract from the experience a bit.  Do this on a slow day and it's 5 stars all the way."", 'We hiked this yesterday.

Best hikers with trail etiquette I've ever seen."", ""Beautiful views and so many different things to see.  We ended up at snow so the trail became a bit confusing at that point but it was still worth it and something I'd do again.  I went with my 64 year old Mom who rocked the Trail.  We were checking it out for my kids to see if it would be appropriate for their age range.  After hiking this trail I decided I won't be taking them until they are older because there are some narrow and very rocky areas that are not suitable for small children."", 'Great hike to gorgeous views of Donner Lake and Sugar Bowl.

Go early you will thank yourself it gets very hot after noon!  Great hike!', 'Beautiful hike. The trail has places where it was not clearly marked or the trail was covered with snow.

Very diverse as you progress, going from bare rocky switchbacks to conifer forests.  Went in July and still plenty of snow, making the hike a little more difficult.  Trail markings are sparse so keep an eye out, especially in the areas of snow, as the trail becomes less clear.  The summit is pretty awesome.  Those ski boundary signs are a bummer though, degrade some spectacular views!  Still worth it!', 'Magnificent Hike - The wildflowers were beautiful and the view from the top was fantastic.  Still some snow to get around which made it even more interesting.', 'Absolutely stunning. Still a little bit of snow, but easy to get around it.', 'awesome hike. took a detour for Donner peak. so gorgeous.', 'Gorgeous day on 7/17, with wildflowers on the ridge and a lot of snow to admire on surrounding peaks. What a stupendous hike! I completed he loop, but had to skirt, scramble, and in one place crawl, over large snow patches on the trail. The most challenging area was getting up to the ridge, where I needed hands and feet.', 'definitely marked as one of my favorite trails now. BEAUTIFUL!', ""I have done this trail many times. It is spectacular as a wildflower hike. Some years better than others. Go counterclockwise as the east slope is in full sun and you want to be going downhill there. The view from the top is excellent. At the Donner saddle you can take a side trip to Donner Peak. Pretty easy except for the last 100 ft of elevation. Fantastic view  Also some years. Even in July. There is snow on the east side of Mt Judah. Can be tricky. Be careful. It's a long dangerous slide should you lose footing. Otherwise excellent trail"", 'Still too much snow to hike the complete Mount Judah Loop as of July 3! Enjoyable nonetheless. Created a loop trail through ski slopes and road at lower elevations.', 'I love  this hike.', ""Did the hike mid-June of 2017 and as others have mentioned there is still quite a bit of snow. This makes finding the trail a fun exercice. The view of the valleys on both sides as you climb up is stunning but the true treasure is the 360 view from the very top. I'd highly recommend planning on stopping up there for lunch to really spend time taking the scenery in. The snowy tops observed from a blossoming summit can keep me going for hours.The hike is easy and short. Since we couldn't see much of the trail we decided to just go straight up under the sugar bowl chairlifts. Perfect for a one-day/afternoon outing."", 'As of June 18, 2017: due to the 160% of normal snowfall of 2016-17, this trail is not (as of date) very passable. Right now, you should take an ice ax and crampons to get across steep sections of snow over the trail. Just 1/4 mile in, you must cross a snowfield that, if you slipped, would slide you fast down and onto a boulder field. Yet, past this, most of the trail is clear and good, until you get up to where it crosses the Sugar Bowl ski area. Then, the snow patches become continuous and often steep, and without GPS, the trail is hard to discern. Very pretty up there. The map route posted here is not adhering to the loop trail, probably due to detours around snow patches. All in all, it would be best to wait a month or more to hike this excellent trail, and follow the trail markings on the map via GPS.', 'Loved this one!  Did it wth our 6 and 8 year old kids.  One part was pretty steep drop off but great views!', ""The hike was 1/2 up hill and 1/2 downhill but the view was so pretty! Perfect for beginners that want to hike high but can't commit to a too many miles."", '5.5 mies with 1220 ft elevation increase. Pretty Moderate to strenuous at times.

The view up top is amazing!!!!', ""Can't wait to go back when the wildflowers are blooming!"", 'Spectacular views and lovely forests. Gives you a great sense of how the transcontinental railroad was put in.', 'Great hike. Popular trail. I recommend to start early. Great view at the top of mt Judah.', 'Really busy, a big tourist spot. Trail is almost always congested, but on a clear day, the views from the top of Donner Lake and a 365 of the Sierras is worth it! Fun boulders to climb at the top, and a perfect spot to eat lunch and enjoy the view before heading back down. Dog friendly, most dogs off leash. Windy at the top!', 'Not good.  Windy, boring, no payoff.', 'Busy holiday weekend, but worth the traffic.', ""One of my 3 children has a cold. We went back about 3/4 away up. We ate lunch overlooking Mary Lake. Not bad I've been on better. His cold gave us the excuse to head back. Maybe we will do it again in full. Not sure if our heart wasn't into it or it was something about the trail that left us feeling average rather than superb."", 'Had a lot of variety as I tend to like loop trails much more than out and back. Two photographers in our group so we had plenty to shoot along the way. Rocky switch-backs at the start but mostly packed dirt the whole loop.', 'nice 3 hr hike.  great 360 view at top', 'School\'s back- and what better way to ""celebrate"" than going out to Donner Pass? Our school generously took the Class of 2020 out to Donner Pass for three days, and the highlight of the trip was unquestionably this hike.\n\nThe hike starts out on a rocky switchback trail. You will walk only on rocks (no dirt or vegetation,) but you will be able to easily stay on the trail. The entirety of the 0.9 mile leg is composed of broken-down boulders. A great leg if you like hiking along boulderfields.\n\nThe first peak you\'ll have the chance to summit is Donner Peak. The views from the top are unrivaled by any others in the area; you get a view of both Lake Mary and Donner Lake, as well as Van Norden and the Chinese-constructed tunnels in the distance.\n\nYou will then hike along a ridge up to Mount Judah (beware the false summit halfway from Donner). The path is sturdy, albeit narrow, and can be done with relative ease. Mount Judah offers a view of Sugarbowl Ski Resort (Mt. Lincoln) and the Pacific Crest Trail. In the distance, a small patch of snow could be seen on Tinker Knob.\n\nThe rest of the loop is mainly through a peaceful forest and/or meadow. You will pass four streams in the early summer (dried out by August, unfortunately.) You\'ll have a brief stint through a ski resort before returning on the aforementioned boulderfield path.\n\nBeware of yellowjackets. Two of my friends got stung on Donner Peak alone. Move away from water sources or limit your breaks to stay clear of these pests. Do not let the bees keep you from hiking this trail- it\'s a must do!', ""Absolutely loved this trail, not difficult and the views at the top are amazing. Trail markers are minimum but it's self explanatory and usually there are a good bit of people on the same trail just in case"", 'This trail does not seem to exist where marked on map.  It seems to refer to a trail in the Sierras (several hundred miles away), or at least that what the pics look like. It does not seem to exist on the Boonville Ukiah Road.', ""Great hike with amazing view and rocks to scramble up all the way. Plan on it taking around 3 hrs. if you aren't going fast. But the views are well worth the walk."", 'I soloed this trail today and really enjoyed it. Gonna sleep well tonight. Friendly fellow hikers along the route', ""Completed this hike in a little under three hours. It's an easier hike (I managed it with carrying my toddler) with beautiful views. The start is a rockier and the day we hiked it, haze had set in- but it was still great!"", 'Great hike!', 'Lots of loud hikers during this time of year. Good hike, lots of wildflowers.

Not one bit of it we did not enjoy. Still a few patches of snow, but nothing to worry about especially if you have poles.', 'Nice little trek, uphill all the way to the top, down hill all the way back.

If you're not somewhat experienced then check out Donner peak or wait for warmer weather"", 'Still snowy in early June as we had a lot of snow coming down this year. Parts of the trail are covered through with snow, but you can easily spot footprints from others who have made their way through to continue the path. Great views up top!', 'Great hike with the kids and dog.  Took a good part of the day as I have smaller children.  Pretty windy near the top, but beautiful views.', 'This was a cool hike. Snowshoes make it very challenging. I was a little disappointed at first. It looked like we were going to hike Sugar Bowl ski resort but only had to cut through one slope. We headed the trail counter clockwise and it worked out fine. The uphill /side hill was not easy! The view from the top was very nice.\nWinds on the top were at least 40mph.', 'Awesome views. The elevation climb was a little rough for someone with asthma.', ""Unfortunately it was too smoky to really see the view, so I guess I'll need to go back for this one. :-)"", 'My Fitbit tracked it at 6.25 miles. Good training ground for backpacking. Saw a few dogs on the trails and some children as well. It can get warm in some areas of the trail so layers would be good to wear (remove your hoodie when walking towards the summit). There is a porta potty at the beginning of the trail and nothing else throughout the whole hike. View of Donner lake is spectacular.', ""I love the trail even if it's rocky to get to the beginning of the Mt Judah trail. Breathtaking view especially at the top of the mountain. Absolutely one of my favorite."", 'Really solid hike! Beautiful scenery.', 'Great hike to do!!!', 'I would rate this as an easy/moderate hike.  Nice views of Donner Lake from top of Mt Judah.  A lot of switchbacks at the beginning/end of the hike, but once past those, the trail becomes a lot more manageable.  Trail has some steep drop-offs on the back side of the mountain.  Nice day hike for the family (youngest being 10).', ""My husband and I hiked this trail in August '15 and it was amazing. It was my first time in California, and I have never hiked at such high elevations (being from GA). The trail starts out a bit hard because of all the rocks and most of the elevation gain was in the beginning. We ran into a lot of people finishing the trail (it was around 2pm when we started), but by the time we got to the ridge we were the only hikers on the trail. The views were breathtaking, the most beautiful I have ever seen! It was my favorite part of our week-long stay in CA and I can't wait to go back and do more hiking. I wouldn't recommend the trail for young kids because of the very rocky terrain in the beginning, but if your an adult in decent shape than do this trail- you won't regret it! FYI, we got a map for the trail from the Donner Museum- and I can't thank the young lady who recommended the trail enough! And if you are pale skinned and not use to elevation like me- make sure you pack plenty of sunscreen! The sun is intense up there!"", 'The top of this trail is beautiful, when you get to the top you can see what I would guess is 100 miles in one direction and 50 in the other, a local hiker who we spoke to on the way down said the top is ""the crest"" of the PCT. The first half mile of the trail is actually advanced and all rocks stacked on rocks but the rest is intermediate and we\'ll groomed, remember not to veer off into the service roads. The trail is actually 6.5 miles from the road, the first mile is just technically a different trail, but I don\'t know how you could avoid this first mile unless you could fly. Overall, for a guy from southern California this trail was well worth the effort.', 'Trail was very rocky to start.  Then It between woods and sunny areas.  Great views of Donner Lake.  It was much longer than 4.5 miles.   According to my fit bit it was more like 6.5.  Views at top were fantastic.', 'Great hike convenient for a stop on way from Sacramento to Reno. We hiked in early July and the wildflowers were tremendous. Views are outstanding, of Donner Lake and surrounding peaks. Very nice. Be careful with the roads that cross the PCT; signage could be better.', 'Beautiful views of Donner Lake and the surrounding Sierras. I would rate this trail as moderate - got our our hearts pumping on the uphill. It can get a bit busy on the weekends (especially with a holiday), so we recommend an early start to avoid the crowds.', ""Done this twice - views from the top of Mt Judah and Donner Peak are great.  Donner Peak has a wonderful natural labyrinth on top which is great for kids. I'd rate the full loop as moderate rather than easy - I measured 2000' of elevation gain over 5.1 miles."", ""Okay, now that I have officially completed this hike it was AMAZING. I am 26 years old, and it moderate shape as far as stamina and strength goes. I am also from FL, so the elevation kind of took the wind out my sails a little, making the trail more difficult (for me). I was also carrying my 2 year old in the Kelty; he weighs about 26 pounds and I had an additional 20 pounds of water and food and emergency gear in the pack bringing the total to about 46 pounds. All this being said, if you want to carry your child in a hiking carrier, you DEFINITELY need hiking/trekking poles. DEFINITELY. I wouldn't go up the first set of switchbacks, nor would I traverse the narrow trails with sheer sides with a kid on my back without them. There is a lot of loose gravel and rock on many sections of the trail. So long as you use your situational awareness, and have proper gear, you'll be fine. Bring lots of water and snacks. This trail was seriously amazing, and afforded the most amazing, spectacular views. Even on a hazy day like today. Just a heads up, there is little to no shade once you're on the Judah loop, so if you bring children bear that in mind. I personally wouldn't let a child under 11 or 12 walk alone on this one. \n\nThe start of the trail is just a brown sign with a white arrow pointing toward the trailhead. It isn't super clearly marked. There are two logs you step over to get on the trail. Just park in the parking lot of the Soda Springs Ski academy and walk down to the bottom of the hill and you will see it."", ""I actually have a question. I hope someone who has hiked this trail sees this! I am trying to plan a hike on this trail, but I have a 2 year old whom I carry on my back in a Kelty Tour 1.0 hiking child carrier. While it does distribute the weight like a normal hiking backpack would, my balance is still slighly off when I carry him. So my question about this trail is this: Can I hike with him on my back safely? I am concerned about losing footing and falling off a cliff, or sliding down a steep rocky incline/decline. Thank you! Unfortunately this website doesn't have a function to ask questions."", 'Well maintained trail. Nice views at top. Moderate difficulty in a few spots, especially at the start. Dog friendly but start is rocky for dogs with tender paws', 'The view alone makes this trail worth it.\nMake sure you take time to wander a little bit. There are multiple lookout points that are amazing if you step off the trail briefly.', ""one of our favorites! we do it often by either going to Judah summit, Donner summit, PCT to saddle, Anderson, Tinkers knob,etc. beautiful area, lakes, views of Donner are breath taking. been up when it's very windy and have to hold on to your hat and other times it's quite calm. see many people but not so many that you can't still feel the wilderness! bit of a climb up pleasant rocky switch backs soon after parking but the beauty  will keep your focus."", 'Great hike, pretty easy for experienced hiker in shape. Gorgeous views and eat to follow. Pretty busy trail but most hikers are awesome people so no worries.', ""Beautiful hike! As you're traveling south on the PCT section of the trail, continue on for another 300 yards or so past the second turn off for the Mt. Judah Loop.  You'll come to a Donner party monument that is very informative and pretty cool. Great views also."", 'Definitely more than 4.5 miles- the hike to the trailhead for the loop alone is 1.5 miles.  I would say around 6 miles, a little less.  Fun uphill, beautiful views.', 'First things first, this hike is longer that 4.5 miles. Closer to six. I only say that because we had six kids under 10 and although we are very proud they did all 6 miles not sure I could have convinced them to do it if they knew it was 6. That said, great hike with lots of beautiful wild flowers and views. Bring plenty of water.', 'very nice trail, short drive from Reno, most excellent views', ""Nice, clear trail. Only the beginning was tricky to find from some overgrown bushes, but they may be cleared. Views are great and it is nice to see a ski area when there isn't snow."", ""nice hike. bring water and a camera. decent ascent, but not what I'd call strenuous."", ""Mt. Judah Loop and Donner Peak – Pacific Crest Trail 5.5 Miles - 1700 ft Elevation Gain (7,100 - 8,243) 4-5 Hours\n\nThe PCT trail head is off Donner Pass Road.  If you are coming from Sacramento, take the Old Highway 40 exit in Soda Springs. Once you pass Sugar Bowl Rd you will come up to a cluster of buildings on the right, one of which is Sugar Bowl Academy. Pull in and drive to the back of the parking lot which is the beginning of the Old Donner Summit Rd. The PCT trail head is at the bottom of the hill. \n\nIt's a great hike with some pretty stunning scenery. Most of the beginning was switchbacks with rocks, making your tired feet at the end of the hike a little unhappy… BUT – I’d do it again! The climb between Donner Peak and Mt. Judah was robust with several switchbacks. Once you get to the top it’s worth the effort and the way down had nice views of the Royal Gorge."", 'Love this trail! Amazing panoramic views, easy to follow, good workout, nice and short.  The first time I did this trail was in early July and the wildflowers were amazing.  Second time I ran it with a friend.  We actually had to hike the first part due to the steepness and rocks, but once the trail leveled out a bit nearing the summit we ran it easily all the way back to the trailhead.', 'Lynn and I were a bit apprehensive about going on this hike because of the description ... Altitude climb of over 1,700 feet! The first part of the trail was loaded with switchbacks ... and rocks. Karen\'s description was very appropriate,  ""It appears we are ripping off the band aid quickly as the most difficult part of the hike is in the beginning"" as most of the climb was at the beginning meaning most of the descent was at the end. There was a pretty healthy climb between Mt. Donner and Mt. Judah with a lot of switchbacks, as well. There were a few times I questioned my own sanity, but it was well worth the efforts! Absolutely breathtaking views all around! As always, I\'ve included a link to my blog that\'s filled with photos that are too large to upload here. (And, yes! I\'d do this hike again and again!)', 'Loved this hike! Scenic the whole way. Huge ass trees. We went to Donner peak before going to Mt. Juda . Good workout and great trails. Definitely going back. ', 'This is a nice trail, though busy.  This is not a wilderness trail, you are basically in Sugar Bowl,  though it makes a nice run with the hill and is well maintained (and new).  Great views including Royal Gorge on the way back down to the PCT.  you can also include Donner Peak from the saddle between Donner Peak and Mt. Judah..', ""I actually didn't get to do this trail as they were running a triathlon on the weekend we were there. I did want to comment on the other post. Once you get to Donner Lake you need to make a right onto Donner Pass Road and continue up the mountain towards Mount Judah in order to find the trailhead. "", 'Nice hike, with great views! For some reason the map was telling me the trail head was down by donner lake, took me a while to find it. Brought the dog, and the terrain was not too bad at all! Recommend this hike to anyone of any skill level!', ""This is one of my favorite hikes.  You get a good work out, lots of vistas and different terrain too, all in around 2 1/2 to 3 1/3 hours depending on your pace and side trips.\n\nWe usually head for this hike in July and August especially if its been a snowy winter.  You always get a nice breeze here and its typically 15 degrees cooler or more than the valley.  Today was another great hike.  Since the snowfall last winter (2013) was light, there were only a few snow ponds to traverse.  Lots of spring flowers though and they should last into July.  \n\nThere are many great spots to stop and soak in the majesty of the mountain views, and with Donner lake in view at the summit, well  it doesn't get much better than this.  There are many side trails to take for even more spectacular views.  \n\nIt can get a little busy in July and August but not so much to detract from the hike.  You'll usually run into people hiking the PCT too.  Your on the PCT for a short period.  And there's history to be experienced here too.  A little side trip to Roller Pass and you get a first hand look at where the pioneers dragged their wagons, Oxen and all their gear up shear slops.  \n\nBring plenty of water and a good hat.  Enjoy!"", 'This hike is truly great. Wonderful views. May want to go later in the season unless you have snow shoes. I went on 5/18/13 and some parts of the trail were covered in snow and I was unable to reach the summit once you hit higher elevations. Will go again!', ""My friends and I loved this hike! It was an absolutely beautiful/well kept trail with awesome views. We included Donner Peak in our loop for some additional distance/difficulty.

Trails were a little muddy due to last nights rain. Went counter clockwise which made the ascent a little easier', 'This is one of my favorite trails in Santa Clarita. It offers two trails, one approximately 5.5 miles and another approximately 1.5 miles. This trail is often heavily trafficked, and this includes mountain bikers (why they choose to ride on this pedestrian trail is beyond me). In the summer, watch out for rattlesnakes.', 'I really liked this hike! It was well maintained with good signage and trail markers. the Towsley Loop had lots of beautiful vistas and rock clambering, I brought my dog and she loved exploring all the different areas. I definitely hope to return to explore more of the creek bed and tar pits.', 'Great hike for sure, fir being right off the 5 highway you only notice it in view. Loved dome of the areas that challenged you up some decently steep grades. Even areas that have nice mature old Oak trees along the route. I went on a Monday mid morning and only passed a few people. The trail connects to others if you want to make it closer to a 6.5 mile hike.', 'Great hike. Took the family including our little who is only 2 but even she enjoyed it! There are some steep banks and you gain decent elevation throughout but all in all this has been one of my favorite hikes in LA.', ""Had a great hike! Start a bit later (around 10am) and the weather was perfect. We hiked the loop counter clockwise (which I recommend as most folks seem to be going clockwise). There are many lookouts just before the summit over Santa Clarita - if you keep going you'll get to what is the 'actual' summit on the trail, but there is a side trail on the right that loops around and takes you to the spine of the ridge up to an actual summit. Lookouts from up there are great! It also seems like that used to be a maintained trail but no longer is (it keeps going to other summits nearby). With that extra spur we clocked around 7.2 miles and were back to the car by 1pm."", ""**WARNING**\n\nHiked on 11/25/18, parked in the dirt parking lot on the right and someone tried to break into my car.  They busted both driver and trunk keyholes but thankfully weren't able to get in.  I didn't have any valuables in my car that might tempt someone so be aware of leaving your car in the free parking lot.\n\n\nHike itself was enjoyable but I wouldn't want to risk my car getting broken into."", 'Kickass hike, tar pits, just an all around amazing trail with great scenery and awesome for picture taking', 'Good trail with some nice canyon splitting. There are numerous tar pits at the beginning of the trail. There is quite a bit of wildlife as well. Very moderate hike with only a small section with some grade to it', ""Just did this one for the first time this morning, and I have to say it is by far one of the most intriguing hikes I've done. My friend and I started from the east end and worked up and down to the west end, where we found a BUNCH of tar pits!! I could even smell a hot spring somewhere, but I could not find it. After the tar pits is a very small interesting canyon with beautiful rock formations. I was very fascinated by them because some of them have a white substance all over them - I wonder if it's calcium or salt - and the striations are vertical as opposed to horizontal. There are also lots and lots of holes in the rocks which makes me believe at one point these rocks were submerged in water.  All in all, it is not only a very beautiful hike, but a very educational one. I recommend it to everyone, even beginner hikers because even though it is a very challenging hike, the sights are well worth it!"", 'Gorgeous', 'Beautiful hiking trails, good for family and pets.', 'Hiked this trail yesterday. It was beautiful. Still lots and lots of wildflowers. Did it alone with my dog It was a weekday and it felt pretty secluded at times. There was one spot that my dog had to walk through tar. There were some pavers spread out across it . But, he couldn’t really manage them. Somehow the tar even got in his water bowl! Then he didn’t want to drink from it. That was the only negative. There are bathrooms and trash cans at the bottom which is awesome. Didn’t have to take waste bags home with us for a change. Felt pretty safe. Beautiful and a good workout.', 'If you take the longer loop, it’s close to 6miles with significant elevation change making it a moderate trail. Very clean and well kept, not busy. Fantastic views at the top. Some really lovely flowers this time of year and an interesting bubbling patch of oil along with various tarry spots along the way. Overall very interesting and enjoyable.', 'One of the best trail for hiking for beginners, really awesome view and so quiet for meditation lovers or relaxation', 'Gorgeous canyon views!', 'Amazing views from the canyon! Wild flowers along the trail in mid April.', ""I'm new to hiking and did this trail.  Was a bit harder than expected but certainly worth it.  This time of year, it is great, cool and green, with excellent views.  I was happy I completed,  next time I'll do with my backpack with some weight to it."", 'Great 5 ml trail good for running & walking.', 'Beautiful trail with a major incline. One side of the mountain is steep and one side has a series of switchbacks a small year round creak flows in the canyon below. Hike it in the cool months between March and May and you will see miles of rare California green and lots of wild flowers making they’re brief appearance for the year. Highly recommended!', ""I can't tell how much I like this hike. haha. We started around 2:30p. Parked in the first lot outside the gates, just in case we didn't make it back by sunset (they lock the gate at sunset). Did this counter clockwise. It's like you're somewhere else for the first portion. Lots of shade, large rocks, and a stream. Very nice and cool - Up through about the 2mi mark from the gate. Once you get to the top, there is a cool tree laying on it's side and a view. We thought this was the very top. But, we were fooled we walked about 5 mins past it and there was an even bigger tree with an even better view."", 'Great views with some shade and water features.', 'Great trail! If you want a nice up hill workout, make sure you start the trail from the front to get that big hill, otherwise the back way is a great workout as well, but without he big hill upward hike. Either way, great trail! You can also turn around in the middle, by the stream part, and go back and that offers more distance and intensity.', 'Very nice hike!', 'I’d consider this more of a moderate trail about 5 miles total, but then again I’m pretty active.  This is a great trail for mountain biking as well and is a gradual climb.  As you get to the top, there are quite a few dead trees which make for great photo ops.  Didn’t see much from a tar pit geothermal perspective, though.  Great for dogs too, though sometimes the path gets pretty narrow.  You can’t get lost.  It’s an easy loop!', 'Love this local challenging trail.', 'best after it rains.', 'Definitely a good little trail.  Lots of different things to see and the dog loved it.', 'Good hike if you want a workout and have a couple of hours! Took my dog, she loved it!', 'I do this hike at least once a week, great for the dog , there is a very small part that you cross a oily patch, but it is only about 6 feet wide.try both directions as it is a different hike depending on which way you go on the loop', 'Prettier than you can tell from the pictures!', 'Great scenes, definitely off camber and slippery when dry...glad I brought the trekking poles helped balance well.', 'Nice hike', 'Easy run', 'Love the intensity of this hike', 'It varies each season which I love.', 'Great Workout.

Definitely will  be doing again!!"", 'This is a beautiful hike and also challenging which I like very much.', 'I really enjoy this trail. There is the long 6 mile loop and a shorter 2 mile loop. Both are fun. The longer loop is challenging and steep in parts and during certain times of the year part of the hike takes you across a flowing creek. The shorter one is great for a quick hike that also has some elevation. It is my go to Sunday morning hike.', 'Great training ground for difficult hikes or for daily conditioning. The hike features small tar pits on opposite sides of the mountain', 'I hiked here while the wolf flowers were blooming this spring and it was gorgeous. There were poppies, grape soda, and so many others.', 'I love this trail. So much to see along the way. It does get crowded though.', 'This is a great trial! There is a steep incline for half of it, so some people might be turned off by this, but the view at the top is beautiful and worth it.\n\nShade is hit or miss throughout the hike and there are quite a lot of biting gnats. Thin trails, so it might be difficult to navigate a mountain bike if hikers on the trail, but overall, fun!\n\nLove the end when you are walking between two large mountains in a dried up river bed. Awesome.', 'If you like switchback up and down, this is the trail for you.', 'Solid hike and tough trail. At one point I was staring off and stumbled upon on 2 deer chilling on the trail. Great 360 views, a couple of tar pits and a tree swing at the top. The only drawback were the very aggressive flies, at one point they were dive bombing my face.  It was beyond annoying. Will definitely take bug spray if/when I go back.', 'Nice', 'The temperature was ideal for a mid-day hike (I would avoid hiking this in the afternoon on a really hot day) so my girlfriend and I did the clockwise route at about noon. The path is very well maintained with a lot of foot traffic. We saw a rattle snake that had just moved off the trail so beware. Lots of lizards, birds and gorgeous wildflowers. The bubbling tar pits are interesting. Views from the top are spectacular on a clear day! This hike has several hill climbs that will test your endurance. The hills are slow, steady, not very steep, but go on for awhile. Bring water and watch your step for crawly things.', 'Great loop for training or enjoying a great view of SCV. Depending on your pace, this can be an easy stroll or a brutal work out. I train here at least once or twice a week with a pack to prep for other strenuous hikes (Yosemite, Mt. Whitney etc.) Get an early start to spot deer and other wildlife. Early spring this year was amazing. Everything green, lupine and poppies blooming, creeks flowing... one of the best trails in SCV. Also many other more challenging trails in the vicinity. Will post more on these soon.', 'Mediocre. Few smelly tar pits and bubbly water holes.', 'Fell in love! It was absolutely beautiful.', 'Amazing trail and the greenery and flowers are amazing right now!', 'a beautiful place love it ❤❤❤', 'a very nice place love it', 'Great Work out. Must go early AM. Gets hot quick!!', 'Nice family outing. Not too difficult of a hike with great scenery.', 'Beautiful day for a hike.  A little bit of everything.  water crossing, switchbacks, oil pools, and wild flowers.  Shadeoff and on.', ""We did the 5.1 mile loop today. Weather was perfect with a cool breeze. Hills looked green and the trail looked like it was raked recently in the steeper areas and very easy to get around. We went all the way to the back and did the counter clockwise direction. After a series of switchbacks, we crossed a small tar field with a couple of ways to step across it without any problems, and later we smelled sulfur at one section on the way up too. Then after passing the bench and most of the decline back down, there was a small bubbling tar pit that was fun to see off the side of the trail. It was great to see and hear the creek running with water again after so many years of drought. Started at 9:30 and finished by noon, just in time for lunch. Couldn't have timed it better!"", 'So much variety in terrain!!!! From forest', 'G', 'I love this trail. Gorgeous mountain views, quite a climb. I prefer to go straight back on the dirt road all the way to the closed road rope off where you can continue on the right (tends to be the backward way). This way, uphill is a bunch of switchbacks and a steeper decline.', 'Great hike. Really gets your legs working. Only thing is the smell of sewage towards the back of the loop. Not the worst thing in the world, but it gets you.', ""Always a good challenge.  I start the trail from the left just after the parking lot.  There is a really steep part that is slippery so it's better to go up it then down it.  I also love the view coming down the switch backs.  Kinda looks like your heading into a box canyon and is spectacular.  It is definitely a better hike this time of the year....no boiling sun and no snakes.  I did see a deer today which was cool.  She just looked at me and kept munching away at the brush."", ""Overall a pretty nice hike. I went to the right uphill first.  Some things to note:\n-coming down is about 1.5 miles of pretty steep downhill.  People with bad knees can relate.\n-Parts of the trial are pretty narrow.  Cliff on one side.\n-Parts are on a slant so you're not walking/running on level ground.\nGreat views and some nice wooded areas with a little stream of water.  Parking lots were really full but didn't encounter too many ppl on the trail."", 'This is a nice trail. love the bubbling crude oil right out of the ground. clockwise is the hardest for sure. only down side is this place has lots of visitors and at the start of the trail lots of dog crap on the trail.', 'Great day to hike this trail. Cool, and cloudy. Just rained the day before. I hiked the trail clockwise. Good workout on the switchbacks to the top. Beautiful scenery in every direction. I would clasify this as moderate overall however.', ""We took the clockwise route which I was told is the faster route to the top, but also harder. IT WAS!!\nHowever, overall it is a good trail with great views and its kept up. We didn't see any water in the creek bed which was depressing, but hopefully some day there will be."", ""Hard and fun to do. There's a lot of beauty out there, and you feel far away without having to go that far."", ""I'm 66 and love this trail it's never easy but always feels great when done."", ""Brought some friends here today and they love it! Except it's 100 degrees heat."", 'My first place to do my first hiking and it keeps me going!', 'Awesome hike, but definitely a morning hike.

A nice little workout ', 'Good hiking', 'Awesome', 'Great', ""work your booty kind of trail, if it wasn't for the close encounter with rattle snakes I would go back, just can't stand those creatures...but it is a pretty good hike. 3 review cause of rattle snakes."", 'The clima was good ai got there early at 7:00 am good workout', 'Great Hike so near to Santa Clarita. Views are good. Hike will make you sweat. The occasional rattler will keep you awake.', ""Great hike! Small rocky stream, a couple of rattlesnakes, some wildflowers, and seeping oil and sulfur smell in a few places make this an interesting route. I went counterclockwise and enjoyed it. Not crowded at all. I'll definitely do it again."", ""Missed the trailhead so ended going counter clockwise instead.  Will have to check out a few other short trails next time.  For those who bring their four legged friend, you'll want to be careful walking your dogs through the tar area.  Best to pick them up to cross or leave them at home."", ""It's a Love Hate Relationship with this trail I love it because it's a great workout nice view easy to follow And I hate it because it always kicks my Butt! Be careful with snakes."", 'Rough and uneven terrain, but a great local workout!', 'Great trail.  Missed the clockwise trail entrance right after passing the parking fee area.  Ended up doing the 5.4-mile loop counter-clockwise, finishing the trail running down the long downhill.  Technical trail if mountain biking.', 'Hard trail, about 6 miles long (loop), but totally worth it. One of the best I have hiked. \nFew tips;\nTake the trail counter-clock wise. The climb is more moderate.\nIf you are not into a hard one, take the scenic trail, about 2 miles long.\nBetter to hike in the morning, When it gets hot, it is HOT. Bring plenty of fluids, hat, hiking sticks, binoculars, camera, dress comfortably, especially shoes. Get ready for about 3 hours of hiking. I have seen so many who quit because they were ill-prepared. \nThe trail is clear and well maintained. You cannot get lost, Stay on the main trail. Prepare for snakes crossing your path. There are about 5 Tar Pits, 2 of them right on the trail itself still oozing tar. Spend time at the top of the hill, the view is amazing in all directions.', 'First time here, we were not familiar with the complete trail. we took a shorter modified version. good hike steep terrain, great version for someone getting into or getting back into hiking. leaving the parking lot we stayed on the road to the right till we got to the beginning of the park, entered onto the trail south, crossed over the mountain till we came to the ""T"" on the trail and we then made a left and followed it back to the parking lot. good hike, not a lot of shade, suggest going in the morning. not knowing we went in the afternoon approx. 11:30 am, luckily we had hats and enough water for the duration of our hike.', ""Great parking and we'll maintained trail."", 'nice loop. but come early. nice challenge', 'Nice easy escape', 'nice trail', 'Love this hike!

The long loop too has better scenery."", 'Nice', 'arrived at 7:45am on a Sunday the front parking lot was full you can park inside (free) which is closer to the trailhead. Did the trail clockwise which is supposed to be more challenging. about 1 miles in before you start to climb their is a single track that goes left away from the main trail. we saw two people come down this trail we decided to try it. The first part is an aggressive incline then about a mile you get to a point where you have to climb rocks at an incline. at this point we backtracked to the main trail. this added about 2 miles to the overall hike. this is a good hike.', 'Really like this trail. Best in the spring. Nice workout.', ""Grew up hiking here and it's just as fun as I remember!"", ""This is the best trail in SCV. Very challenging getting to the top, especially if you are trail running.

I went to the right first in order to get the hardest part of the trail over with. for a good 3 miles or so I climbed hill after hill, steep slopes covered in loose dirt, one after the other. no shade, just craggy chaparral abound and a blazing sun beating down overhead. it was brutal and punishing and not a single vista to spur you on with its beauty, only views of sprawling suburbs and freeways. by the time I got to the forested and gently descending portion of the trail I was so ragged from the first stretch that I was hardly able to enjoy it. once you're down there's another couple of miles that I would call more of a path than a trail, with lady's pushing baby's in strollers and yuppies walking their labradoodles. if you start to the left instead, to get the lame part of the trail over with first, expect the last stretch to be as treacherous going down as it was punishing going up. those steep gravely slopes will have you sliding down on your butt for 3 miles. careful not to twist your knee or sprain your ankle. better yet, there are far more rewarding trails to be found in the southland, equally as challenging as this one with far more to offer."", 'Amazing hike. Go early, its popular and parking fills up quickly. We chose to hike clockwise, so all the elevation gain was in the first third. I would recommend this way. Great views and then great entrance to the creek at the end. Was pretty epic. Got chilly in the shade early and there were a few tar pits bubbling about.', ""This is a regular midweek hike for me that I've been doing 3-5 times a week since May 2014 and never get bored.  Well maybe a starting to get a little bored of doing the same hike after 6 months which Is surprising because I'm one of those that never wants to do the same trail twice.  That is now only true for all other weekend trail hikes even to some way more beautiful.  The scenery is nice and even though some trails I used to call killer that are now easy for me, going clockwise there are a couple really steep parts of this hike I still find very challenging.  Towsley is one of my favorite hikes I like hiking alone with my dog.  You can extend it by hiking the short 1.9 mile hike which is very short but a good short workout in itself due to the incline."", 'Challenging hike. Fairly steep.', 'Good, well laid-out trail.  Easier to go counter-clockwise.  Some parts smell.', ""This trial is challenging, but fun. Most people enter the trial head from the front. The front end of the trial is a steep uphill, but then it levels out into downhill switchback. There are areas to sit in the shade and the area is peaceful. I typically take the back way because it's a longer uphill run. Overall, I like this trial. I took my kids on the trial and they struggled, but they had fun."", 'You feel like you really achieved something When you complete this 5+mile hike.  Moderate for sure and Not for beginners...good hard climb and steep descent...wear your hiking shoes and bring water and allow 2 hours for sure if you want to enjoy the view.', 'I freely admit that I am middle aged and overweight, so I take my breaks when needed on these steep inclines.  I went clockwise on this trail to avoid a steep descent and to save the Narrows for the end of the hike......boy did I pay for it.  This hill is miserable, but the fun part is that EVERYONE going up it is just as miserable as you.  You even die a little inside when you see people coming down and they are grinning ear to ear. When you get to a point that somewhat appears to be the top someone has added a sign that says ""no one likes a quitter""  Hey, what do you know....another half mile of incline!  Once you reach the top you are greeted by a nice view and a welcome feeling of delight.....you descend and now it\'s your turn to take a perverse delight in the suffering of your fellow hikers still heading up the hill. ****All that being said, nearly anyone can do this hike if they take their time and don\'t quit****  Counterclockwise would be easier next time, but I doubt I will do it any differently!', ""I hiked both the 5.1 mile loop and the shorter 1.1 hike.  Liked both except I found the narrowness of the trail a concern for me.  I wasn't worried about me but I had my dog with me and she kept wanting to chase the lizards.  I was worried I'd slip and push her over the edge and she'd hang from me holding onto the leash or die if I dropped her.  I know this sounds ridiculous like a worry wort but I love my dog, she's my kid and since I imagine the worse I prefer the wider trails.  But if I hiked alone this would be one of my favorites.  I always include her and since she is skittish and has bitten a couple people, until I become more of a pack leader and can take her off leash, I'll stick to the wider trails.  One of the coolest things about this trails is the narrowness, constant uphill climb before you start your descent and the moderate length make it an overall great workout for the medium level hiker."", ""My college age kids and I decided to take the track clockwise so we could soak up the scenic views and canyon on the way down. The hike up required a few stops along the way to catch breath and we missed not having water. Fortunately it was a clear, temperate New Years Eve Day and there was sufficient shade. We also found a beautiful oak in a small meadow near the top  - great for climbing and action poses. The descent was beautiful, especially the small canyon with its unique rock formations and dry creek bed. A great hike for the region and a geologist's delight!"", ""Just did this hike on Saturday. We went clock wise which I think is harder IMO. You get great vistas of the SCV. Also it has 2 tar pits along the way which is pretty cool to see. Free parking makes it a fun hike when you have a couple hours to spare. Trail was in great shape and not much trash which is nice. It's not a hidden gem but it is nice & fun."", 'A+++++++++++one of the best trails in the area.first miles are almost XC stuff.... but after the little creek... oh helll yea hold your balls, pull the handlebar and make sure you dont get off the bike!steep steep steep :)NOT for newbies and even not for out-of-shape riders.... great downhill.... BUT be careful with the hikers..... narrow trails... and some spots smell like crap! and dknt get that black oily stuff on your shoes/tires...MUD: boy, i brought a Kenda Nevegal 2.1 and an Ardent on the front.... it was muddy..... that sticky mud from there, gets so sticky and accumulates easy in the gap between the tire and the frame making it impossible to climb.... maybe it was my tires... maybe not...overall, a 6 stars out of 5.... :)', 'Ok, the trail itself probably deserves a higher rating, but my experience was awful. Mostly my own fault. I felt like hiking at 2pm on a 90 degree day and decided to check out Towsley. Huge mistake. Not a lot of shade. Also I have a knee problem and pretty much the entire hike is an incline so I had to stop after like an hour. It was a pretty area but too tough on my knees for me.', 'nice view of scv! kinda dry but nice shade.', 'Towsley Canyon has a lot going for it.  Great views, free parking, challenging inclines, tar pits and a unique rock canyon.  I usually hike counter clockwise around the loop.  The trail starts off simply enough, walking you casually into the beautiful canyon.  Then your nice easy walk quickly turns into an uphill battle.  The incline is a great workout and very rewarding when you reach the top.  A great view looking across I-5 and the Santa Clarita Valley awaits you there.  Stop to catch your breath and take a picture or two.  The trail then wraps around the backside of the canyon, taking you across tar pits and eventually down to a stream and rocky canyon. After another .5 miles or so you will find yourself back where you started in the parking lot.  Towsley Canyon is a great loop that is a little on the difficult side, but well worth the workout.  I recommend making it here during the week, the weekends can get a little crowded.', 'I love this hike! Lots of shade and the paths are pretty clear and not easy to get lost. Did bump into a rattle snake by the end near the gordge but its one of my favorite hikes ', ""Not sure where they got the 5.5 mile estimate... the trail head says 5.1 and regardless, you'd have to be walking really fast, more like jogging, to get that done in an hour.  I think they may need to re-evaluate how they estimate time.  That being said this is a great trail.  Just did it last weekend with my wife and we had a great time.  Awesome views of the SCV with a good mixture of sun and shade.  I will be back soon"", ""A really fun trail.  We went clockwise on the 5.5 mile (it's only 6+ [mentioned in other placed] if you do the additional 1.9 loop) which proved to be helpful as the terrain gets a little steep and when muddy (like we had) it proved to be helpful doing this first.  A nice fun hike with great views of canyons, ravines and the Santa Clarita Valley.  This is my favorite trail thus far in the area."", ""One of my favorites in SoCal.  We were there on a Sunday.  Unlike trails in LA, there weren't too many folks around and parking isn't an issue.  The bubbling tar pits are cool.  It's best to go in early spring or fall/winter.  There isn't much cover so you are in direct sunlight for much of the hike.   Bring Water!"", 'it was a very fun hike lots of wilderness to.', 'Great hike!  Clockwise was a great way to go.  Also, the view was amazing!!  The constant hum of traffic in the distance was the only distraction... The tar pits were a nice touch.', ""This is a beautiful trail we did it at the end of November.  Tar pits and a sulfur spring were a great surprise. I can't wait to home this trail again."", ""The 5 mile loop is best ridden counterclockwise past ranger station; clockwise, even for experienced riders just doesn't cut it for that downhill reward. Add the mile loop for the extra burn. Snakes galore in the spring; hikers anytime of the day. Ride in control fools!"", ""We like to do this hike midweek after work. Start at about 5pm hit the 5.1 mile loop clockwise through the canopy, down the lower post peak switchbacks, pausing at the opposite trailhead. We then pick up the Canyon View trail just to the right of the gate for an extra dose of activity and it keeps us from finishing the hike on a road. Total trip works out to about 6+ miles. 2.5 hours. I didn't put down the date we did this hike, because we hit it year round."", 'Went biking here the other day, during the week about 12 oclock. Didnt see too many people. I went counterclockwise on the loop going up was a bit tuff its not any easy trail, it has lots of switchbacks going up hill. Beautiful place. Going clockwise you would be coming down some steep narrow switchbacks, need to be a little experienced to go clockwise. Saw a snake so keep ypur eyes open. Great workout. Coming down after you hit the top going counterclockwise was great , not too steep but definetely had some steep parts makin it really fun. I would definetely recommend this place.', 'The trail from the free parking area is better for hikers looking for a good workout. Take it 5.1 miles back to where you started. Nice loop trail but beware, 10 hikes I saw 10 rattlers. This was during their peak season starting in May. Overall hike is beyond awesome. Do it.', 'Been riding towsley for about 6 years now...its a great trail if your looking to shove a quick ride into a busy day.  There are to trails; a 6mile and a 1.9mile...the 1.9 is desent but like sex ive better! Park, then ride past the trailhead down the fireroad. When you get to the ranger station stay on the path until you get to the creek...this is the back of the trail...you will go up countless switchbacks but its totally worth it because coming down the front is way better...small drop, roots, rock gardens, and much more!!! Watch out for hikers and rattle snakes, i saw 2 there the other day', 'There are two trails at Towsley Canyon - I took the 5.1 mile loop clockwise facing south (started at the switchbacks and ended at the narrows). Great hike, very demanding. The ascent and descent are both very steep. Views of Santa Clarita valley are fantastic. The trail winds through open as well as canopied areas. There are two places along the trail to stop (one at the summit, and one at the bottom of the switchbacks). Trail was not too crowded - I hiked on a Saturday (over Thanksgiving) and encountered a number of folks - lots of dog-walkers and some runners. This is a great trail for birding too - saw several Calif. Towhee and a number of flycatchers. Weather was noticeably warmer once you get to the south side of the mountain. Narrows were pretty neat - slate formations jutting hundreds of feet up along a fairly narrow trail. I also experienced some type of frothing hot spring, two tar pits, and, towards the narrows, significant sulfur smells. I took two short breaks along the trail for a total hike time of about 2.5 hrs.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '',

The view is fantastic', 'Great hiking trials', 'Great views if you go just before sunset!', 'Beautiful views, a little confusing but thankfully the people are very friendly and willing to help', 'View of the Hollywood sign and amazing city views in all directions. Saw a coyote on the way up. There was horse poop on most of the trail (dirt road) and parking can be hard to find however.', 'great trail!', '4.2 miles round-trip if you park at Lake Hollywood Park. Great trail for the kids too. Our 6 and 9-year old girls did it without whining. Mostly due to the fact that you can see the sign almost all the way to the top. Also a great view of the north side where the 134 fwy and Forest Lawn are located.', ""I favourite LA hike, can be as challenging as you want if you go off the path.

There is usually always a ton of people on this trail but the views are amazing! It's well worth the hike when you finally get to the Hollywood sign!"", ""Although this trail is extremely busy, it's cool to hike to an iconic spot in SoCal.

Bring water!"", 'good one with beautiful views early morning.  tons of people hiking', 'Best to do this early evening.

We went on a weekend and there was a lot of people making the same trek.', 'Classic spot to take visitors from out of town!', 'Lovely views, family friendly .', 'this was a combination of a hike and a walk but there are many different ways to go once you get to Griffith Park. overall fun and challenging trail just because of the heat and incline, has some incredible views of the city, especially at night.', ""This is a walk, not a hike. The slope is minor, but shade is also minimal. Best to go on a cloudy day. I would say that I'm glad I did this trail anyway, since it's what some people only dream of doing, just because of its movie fame.\n\nBest path to the sign, in my opinion, is to start from Sunset Ranch at the end of Beachwood Drive. There's lots of street parking before the gate. Then hang a right up the slope, follow the horse trail a ways, then take a sharp left up another slope. Follow the trail to the paved road, then turn right and walk the road to the top. Bring a small blanket, a sandwich and a drink, and enjoy a picnic with a great view when you reach the top. Or go at night and hop the fence to get up close to the sign. But be very careful, because the path to the sign is not maintained and VERY steep and littered with trash. People may be upset that I'm posting how to get there, but I don't think it's right to withhold information that I got for free."", 'Today was my first time going. I had the best time and an intense work out. There are no signs telling you which way to go, so you pretty much have to use your good judgment. I would recommend this hike to anyone. The only downfall is that there is so much horse poop.', 'It was kind of hard to find which trail to hike up too. The views are gorgeous. Never made it to the Hollywood Sign. It was on the other side. I still enjoyed the hike and so did the kids.', ""I couldn't find a sign that leads to the Hollywood sign.

Very nice scenery. Very hectic climb but so worth it."", ""Great time here! Look & follow the white arrows and it'll lead you straight up & across the mt. through a rougher path.

Go early to avoid the crowds or go during the week as apposed to the weekends."", ""The hike up isn't too bad. Make sure you hike up on a good day clear day to get the better views of the L.A., you can also hit the Wisdom tree trail from here also."", ""This trail gives pretty amazing views of the city and also of the valley. Not too long and pretty easy, this hike is good as a short excursion for tourists wanting a panoramic view of the city.

Waterfall was beautiful! Entered from the south. Made it a bit more challenging because of the huge amount of fallen forest we had to climb over to stay on the trail. The pay off was worth it. Will definitely hike again!', 'Such a beautiful area. Tons of water in the stream and coming down the falls. Highly recommend this hike!', 'falls are easy to get to. my 8 and 6 year olds made it up no problem. very beautiful hike.', ""this trail is so easy to access, clearly marked, breathtaking waterfalls that are easy to get to, great picnic trail!! you can pack a big backpack and the trail is easy enough to handle it. almost didn't want to share cuz I wanted to keep it secret"", 'Both falls were running well. Beautiful trail even with the scarring of fire. The new life that is filling the area is amazing.', 'Beautiful walk along the river even if we did it under the rain. This trail was a pleasure, It is a good alternative to the park when this one is crowded.', 'Great workout, beautiful scenery...Maaaaybe not the best hike for young children or older dogs. There are multiple entrances; the middle entrance gives you a left and right you can make. To the left you can cross the creek to a 5 mile out and back trail (more family and older dog friendly) to the right is more of a moderate hike as you will descend as you get closer to the creek and waterfalls. Great great hike but coming back up can be rough!Enjoy!', ""Great hike! There is a great waterfall two miles prior to the end of the  trail indicated on this map. Beautiful trail, bring bug spray for the first section.  If you don't mind nats, then you will be ok.   Hint to find the waterfall marked on this hike, after you go over the second small bridge, pay attention, to find a split in the trail to the left, that will take you to the small fall that is the end of this trail.  You could continue on the main trail all the way to Sugar Pine. Also, if you want to see the big fall and don't want to do a 6 mile hike, drive up 41 to the trail head that is a paved pull out, well marked on the left hand side.  We drove up and checked it out after we did the hike, because we saw it on on our way out."", 'My family and I do this trail once a year. We really enjoy it. Incline and decline are pretty serious though, for kids. Love the creek and waterfall for splashing around.', 'Pretty hike, lots of other people on the trail (holiday weekend) but didn’t feel crowded. Would be excited to come back in the spring to see the waterfalls at their peak!', 'Very tranquil hike. Not too challenging but about 1000 feet of elevation gain from the trailhead to Red Rock Falls. About two creek crossings, not bad at all. My 22lb dog kept up the whole way and enjoyed! Would do again.', 'One of favorites! Family fun all seasons. We have hiked this trail a few times! Beautiful and majestic views! So peaceful. Some strenuous spots but so worth it!! Check it out!', 'WEAR bugs spray; There’s plenty of bugs & mosquitoes. Trail/creek was beautiful. Expects INCLINE and minors obstacle on trail (fallen trees). Creek was full of flowing water.', 'Great trail! All up hill at first so heading back is easy. There were literally thousands of lady bugs more towards the middle to end parts of the trail. There are plenty of waterfalls to see and it is almost completely shaded. Heading back we ran the trail.', 'Great day hike. I guess you can walk down or walk up. We walked up. It will challenge you but the beauty and peacefulness it nice. Go hike a mountain.', 'Fun little trail up to a waterfall. A few other groups on the trail so no worries about the mountain lion. The Lewis Creek trail car park is actually in the middle of the trail on this map. Worth a try if you’re in the area.', 'I did not see any mountain lions, however there are mountain lion warnings with a note from another hiker dated 9/18/18 9am that he spotted a mountain lion drinking water near the waterfall. I solo hiked and made a lot of noise. Very cool hike. I would have rather had a partner because I had mountain lion on the brain the entire time and I think I would’ve enjoyed it more if I wasn’t so concerned.', 'Wow one of the most scenic hikes I’ve ever been.  The observation deck has an incredible view of the cascading waterfalls.', 'Beautiful but tons of little bugs in your face. Bug repellent is a must!', 'This is my close to home favorite. Easy and keeps you hiking when you do not have much time.', ""Really like it. It's not that easy but during the hiking there is a flowing water next us. And there is a waterfall in the end to play in the water. One of the best trail!!"", 'The majority shaded trail is very easy with a few steep spots especially  to get to the upper Corlieu Falls but there’s a guide rope to help you get down and back up safely. The water was crisp and refreshing creekside and in the falls. Plenty of rocks to sunbathe, read or picnic fall-poolside. I recommend hiking down off the initial trail to the small grottos, smaller falls and creek views along the way. There are butterflies everywhere, the running water and ample shade are soul soothing. There are a lot of gnat type insects around but I didn’t notice many mosquitos. August 19,2018', 'There’s a paved trail so it’s perfect for direction, there was some fallen trees that you had to go under or jump over! Other than that it was great! Didn’t hike the whole thing but what I did I was still able to see creeks and small waterfalls. Started from cedar valley road and parked across from where the trail started in a dirt area- car was safe.', 'We took this hike today with a few Boy Scouts, we started from Cedar Valley Road and went all the way to the falls and back. The water felt great but the first half of the hike has a lot of up and down hills. Overall we had a great time and took our time to enjoy it all.', 'Took the whole family: 10 year old, 4 year old and 11 mo old in front pack. We parked off 41 and hiked all the way down into the falls. great trail!', 'Decent little hike but a comment that says, ""not many hills"" is inaccurate.  It\'s almost all uphill from Cedar Valley Dr., some of it fairly steep.  Of course, I was pretty tired from having hiked Half Dome the day before, but I imagine that people who are not somewhat regular hikers will struggle on this.  It was hot, too, so bring at least 2 litres of water per person.\n\nI didn\'t see any poison oak, but a lot of the types of plants that are frequently mistaken for poison oak. :-)', 'Great hike, my wife and I both enjoyed it. We started off on Cedar Valley Dr. Point and hiked all the way up to the water fall.', 'Fun', 'Awesome waterfalls and  swimming holes! Challenging hike if u push we lolligagged and took time to swim and smell the foliage!', 'Beautiful hike, waterfalls and fresh cool water!', 'Not many hills and lots of shade. Great hike.', 'Huge trees , the breath taking waterfalls , the beautiful butterflies flying over me . Wonderful experience', 'Great views and moderate hike', 'Great hike!! Our Lab loved the trail and the amazing creek! A little rough coming down with a Labrador!  But well worth the time', 'Loved this hike last weekend! We took our dogs with us and they had a blast. They stayed on leash during hiking. But, in the creeks they played in water...don’t worry... under supervision. There were a ton of reviews complaining about dogs...Fellow hikers that came by- we leashed for them. Hike was steep at some points and the path would narrow. Tons of mosquitos near the standing water-  I was drenched in bug spray and still got bit quite a few times. SO many ladybugs on our walk back in! They were flying everywhere! The falls are beautiful! Fun little area once you get in front of it for some swimming or hanging out on the rocks. Definitely recommend this hike.', 'the first half mile is worth it for the amazing water fall view. There is a platform observatory to see the falls absolutely gorgeous.', 'Beautiful! I have gone several times and there’s always something new to see. Don’t forget your mosquito repellant!', 'Went on the 26th of May. Water was roaring and everything was green. parked in the wrong spot though...basically in the dead center of the trail so I was a little annoyed by whatever I entered on my gps that took me there. Watch out for the dog!', 'Beautiful day for wildflowers and thundering waterfalls.   Lots of poison oak, so be careful!', 'I enjoy hiking this trail . the view of waterfall is absolutely beautiful. this is definitely a trail I will do again .', 'Lovely walk up to a beautiful falls', 'Nice short hike. Went on a Wednesday so there was barely anyone. Waterfall is super full. There were some areas where we had to climb over big tree trunks.', 'One of my favorite hikes! If you want to miss the crowds go early.', ""JUST BECAUSE YOUR DOG IS FRIENDLY TO OTHER DOGS DONT MEAN EVERYONE ELSE'S IS I decided to take my dog (100 lbs American pit friendly to ppl not other dogs)  seeing that dogs were allowed ON LEASHES  I figured this wouldn't be a problem being the other dogs (if any or so I thought)  would be on leashes as well.  I can control my dog so it no problem ,but boy was I wrong!  thankfully nothing serious happened but a lot of stupid ppl seem to ignore the leash rule. I get it it's fun to see ur dog roam freely, but u have to realize JUST BECAUSE YOUR DOG IS FRIENDLY TO OTHER DOGS DONT MEAN EVERYONE ELSE'S IS! 4 times I had to stop my dog from almost getting into a fight with other dogs because their stupid owners thought they were PRIVILEGED enough to ignore that rule"", 'Trail north of the highway Trailhead is not currently accessible without crossing a fast flowing stream. South half of trail is fine.', '', 'Nice and peaceful trail. However, towards the end we came to private property and the owner had a pitbull which was not on a leash and some what frightened us. The dog followed us for about 30 sections barking then left us alone. Besides that trail was good!', 'Beautiful!', 'Beautiful hike with gorgeous waterfalls.', 'Absolutely incredible waterfalls! Hiked this trail on April 1, and the water was roaring. It was a busy weekend in the area but there weren’t too many people on the trail. If you’re in the Yosemite area I’d say this is a must do! No fee, dogs on leash allowed. Well maintained trail.', ""It's a nice hike! bring some insect repellant..."", 'We parked near the trail head. Sun and snow made beautiful pictures. Creek runs on the side of the trail. We turned around half way, because couldn’t cross the river. Main waterfall is very pretty, however more people. While hiking to Waterfall was not a sole on a Sunday. Going downhill on way back.', ""This is a great trail from Fall until hit starts hitting the 90s. It's even better after a light snow. Full trail starts at Cedar Valley but if you want a shorter hike then there is another trailhead further up HW41 that is about the halfway point to red rock falls at the end of this trail."", 'so pretty, especially with the light snow we got covering the ground!', 'third time, always love it!', 'Loved this trail! The views were amazing. Lots of inclines, definitley got my heart pumping.', 'Was a very nice hike. Didn’t feel as long as it is. We did have to deal with some snow flurries early on but worth it!', 'Beautiful trail. Some steep inclines but manageable with rest areas, maybe too steep for little ones. Wooden balcony/lookout point with benches at water fall/midpoint.', 'We started on Cedar Valley Dr.. nice hike not to crowded in the am but got busy as the day went on.... A few changes in elevation other then that pretty easy .. waterfalls were pretty cool', 'Great hike, little hard to find the real beginning (on Cedar Valley Dr) instead of the halfway point right off the 41. But either way great hike with plenty of steps and areas to rest and enjoy the falls.', 'Very fun day hike with lots of views of the water', 'Overall it was a fun hike. Two kids aged 12 and 10 were fine on the hike. Only reason why it wasn’t a 5 was because of the excess debris on the trail such as fallen trees, trash, etc. Trail was a bit wet going towards the Christian Camp, but if you’re only hiking to the Falls, it should be fine with moderate foot traffic. There was a loose Pit Bull terrier closer to the Cedar Valley trailhead that barked and scared off a few hikers and their dogs, but there is a big sign from the owner near the trail that read “Beware of the Dog”.', 'Couldn’t find the trail', 'Nice hike even for little kids.', 'Great hike', 'Was closed but many people where still on the trail. It was a great hike!', 'We tried to start at the trail head off of Cedar Valley Dr & the trail head was closed.', ""EASY and beautiful! Great little hike if you're on your way to or coming from Yosemite. Beautiful waterfall and some great pools to cool off in or take a swim. Dog friendly. Lots of people. Most stop at the first fall, but keep going and you'll get to the other smaller falls, and the fun pools. Pretty field and wooded areas to walk through also. The river/creek has a handful of nice places to stop and have a snack."", 'very nice trail ... very pretty', ""Very nice area to hike, would rate this trail 5 stars but today the black flies were so bad we turned back early. If you haven't experienced these flies before you will be surprised at how agressive and persistent they can be, constantly swarming your head and face. A bug net for the face could be the difference between a ruined hike or one that is enjoyable some times of year. Even with Deep Woods Off, the insects were too persistent and thick. Still fairly smoky out today also. A lot of Poison Oak everywhere so be careful there. We will try back again in a while."", ""I'd definitely do it again."", 'It was great lots of shade', 'Nice hike', 'Lots of shade and beautiful views', 'amazing', 'Loved it!!! Easy and beautiful at the end.', 'Today my husband and I took our 3 boys on this hike (3, 4, and 7). We made it all the way up to the waterfalls. It was so nice to be able to stop at the creek and cool off. It did have some steep incline but it was manageable. We will be doing this hike again!', 'Two nice waterfalls. Mostly shaded trail following the creek.  Afternoons on summer weekends can get busy.  Mornings are best if you want less traffic.  Bring a towel if you plan on wading in the creek or just want to cool your feet.  Good choice, just about a hour from Fresno.', 'Awesome views, moderate hike, pups loved it, and we loved it too!', 'Moderate hike with lots of shade, not to populated. Creek running the length of the trail all the way to the falls.', 'Busy trail. Easy hike. Shaded. Waterfall is beautiful.', 'Beautifully shaded and great waterfalls this time of year', 'This beautiful trail is one of the most underrated of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.

Brought our two dogs and had a great time.', ""Recommend turning back after seeing the first falls (where there's a deck and bench) unless you're just looking for the extra mileage. Willow Creek Trail near Bass Lake was similar but a better version of this hike.Pros:-Some neat flowers-First waterfall was nice-Few peopleCons:-Many mosquitos when stopped-Dozens of small flies swarming when hiking-Near the road/traffic noise for a few parts-The hike past the first falls wasn't worth the extra miles"", ""I love this trail it's one of my favorites. The only downside is they took out the bridge between red rock and the trail to corlieu."", 'Nice relatively easy hike. Beautiful scenery. And you can have dogs with you!

I will definitely go back ', 'great hike while we were in California', 'Fun hike.', '', 'If continuing past the first set of falls, there are a few areas with makeshift creek crossings that may challenge your balance. Otherwise, you will be getting wet and the creek is high. There are also a few downed trees across the trail, but easily manageable. The falls are great and the trail is well built and not too strenuous. The most difficult part is the ascent above Corlieu Falls. Do a good tick check afterwards. I pulled 6 off of my dog and 1 off of myself.', ""Did this hike just to the large falls. I heard there's more to do though. I give it a 8 out of 10 for small moderate hikes. Definitely worth the drive and efforts! Do it and love the outdoors!"", 'The water spots were great, found a small pool for my dogs to swim in.

Waterfall was kinda slim.', 'love this trail. not to tough but good excerise and very pretty.', 'Loved this hike. \nWe are in Bass Lake area for a wedding.  My partner and I found this little gem of a hike not far from where we were staying.  We were very pleasantly surprised.  The trail was more beautiful than expected with lighter foot traffic than expected. \nSo many little side trails to the water to explore.  Water falls were definitely fantastic but far from the only beautiful aspect of the creek. We found so many idyllic little pools reflecting the towering redwoods.\nSimply a joy.  Looking forward to coming back.\nLooking forward to coming back to this trail again.', ""My daughter and I hiked this trail on Mothers Day in 2016. It's a moderate hike but we took our time and thoroughly enjoyed it. The smaller waterfalls were nice but we weren't prepared for the highest one at the north end of the trail.

This time of year make sure to bring mosquito repellent.', 'This was our first hike ever and we were guided on this trip by our 11 year old granddaughter, who is a seasoned hiker. The hike was easy and we enjoyed it immensely. The scenery was wonderful, lots of shade with flora and fauna in abundance.

The decline is moderate, and there are occasion steps, and a few steep/deep steps, but not too challenging. A great workout. We took our two teens and they loved it. \n\nFull canopy the whole time so very well shaded. The waterfall is gorgeous. Fairly easy path to follow. I never felt lost. Go with at least one other person because there are signs about mtn Lions. I didn't see much wild life. But it was beautiful. The ascend was a little challenging for us novices, but not too much. Just took a couple of breaks. Brought water with us. It was fun. \n\nWear good shoes because it is rocky and I would've hurt my toes a few times.

The path is paved with steeps and plenty of benches to stop at along the way. 2) You can take a shuttle back to the parking or hike the same path you just descended in which case the benches may be more welcoming.

My point is, if you deal with the people for 0.8 miles and keep hiking you will end up having a great peaceful hike.', ""it's alright for those who are sight-seeing. it's become far too much of a tourist trap though - get there early to avoid crowds"", 'Crowded trail that leads straight down, and then back up.

Decent workout to hike down and back up to parking lot', 'My one tip: Go early, before the crowd arrives. It gets noisy and not peaceful fast.

During the summer the shaded portion is welcomed after the heat!', 'This trail appeared shorter than advertised. The start of the trail is not well marked so it’s difficult to find the trailhead although once underway all other intersecting trails were readily identifiable.

Views are mostly nice... mostly of the valley, but some look out over the hills. Round Top Loop is mostly shaded and good for a short hike.', 'Good length and degree of difficulty. Nice variation in terrain.', ""This area isn't bad, but it's also not great. I think if you live in this area, this is a nice place to go when you want to get out and don't have a lot of time. I'm a bit further out, so I doubt I'll be back. The trails are okay, pretty moderately trafficked. You'll see hikers, bikers, and a good number of dogs (that are of leash).

There's minimal to no cover, so wear sunblock and bring a hat.  Also, because of the cows you will more than likely encounter your fair share of pies and flies.

We found parking in the lot - keep in mind you have to pay $7-$10 for your permit. The trail started leveled ground, then midway it was incline and after it was steep. We ended at the exit, which led to a street and cars parked alongside. Decided to hangout at Stinson Beach for a while before hiking back. Overall, this trail requires you to have stamina and endurance to keep going forward. Other than that, it was very scenic and I would do it again.', 'Great trail with a huge diversity of terrain!', ""Start early and make sure to wear layers. I started the hike counter clockwise to end at the beach. I got sunshine, to rain and dense fog which you can't see 8 ft ahead of you. It was an amazing trail to hike."", 'Absolutely beautiful but start early! A lot of stairs and bring layers as the weather changes quickly throughout the hike!', 'The information provided here is wrong. Dipsea trail is 7 miles one way. The trail path mentioned here does not include the first 2.5 miles of the trail.', 'Combines the essence of Northern Californian Nature - the redwoods, the long open hills, the Pacific coast. Good mix of not so exhausting stretches w very demanding climbs - beware the roots and loose stones. Steps down to Stinson should be taken w caution, and when you return from Stinson take your time on these steps, they are very uneven (no rhythm to establish). A trail that demands your attention/concentration at each step!', 'Awesome trail! Challenging and diverse.', 'I took this trail on a holiday weekend, the trails were packed with people. It was foggy so I missed the views but the trail was  beautiful but the hike is brutal coming up from Stinson. Not a lot of stairs A REAL LOT OF STAIRS!!I was glad when I was near the top it kinda levels off and you go across the ridge. I stopped at the top and met some nice people that suggested I take the Matt Davis trail back so I did it was worth it not having to go down all those stairs with great scenery and put me 1 block from-the trailhead at Stinson where I parked The Matt Davis trail has a few pretty hairy spots that could get ugly if not being extra careful It was a great day over all and look forward to going back to explore other trails on MT TamEDIT I consider myself an average hiker, that night and the next day my legs are really sore', 'I really enjoyed this trail. We started from Stinson Beach, went to mile marker 4 and then turned back. It was scenic.', 'Start early in the day in case you get lost! Use a tracker on your phone (or screen shot directions or a map because you’re not always going to have service!) For the most part, you will see signs to guide you. We took a few wrong turns and had to guess where we were going. We also had to ask a few people directions. My son is 11 and didn’t complain, he even fell and bloodied his knee and still kept going! Although my nephew (his cousin that’s about the same age) barely made it :( We had to stop and sit multiple times, which kind of got irritating because it was getting dark. However, family is family and I felt really bad for my nephew. This hike is def. not for the inactive. There were an abundance of beautiful redwood trees and green forest areas, but I saw very little streams (or what used to be streams) so I wasn’t that impressed. I didn’t see the beautiful bed/meadow of flowers I saw in the pictures on Yelp or online that people posted. It could have also been because I believe we got lost and took a ghost route for a bit. Now that was the scary part- towards the 5th mile I think? I can’t remember but we came to a split path with no signs. We walked one way for a little bit but decided to backtrack and take the other route. The trail kind of seemed shady about half a mile in (very narrow paths with branches and bushes almost about to cover the path). I was thinking about turning back and my son was eager to get out of there he kept going faster pushing through. Eventually the path got a little wider and we ended up back on what we hoped was the Dipsea Trail— but because we were apparently on a ghost trail, we had cut back into the this bigger trail and didn’t know which way to go!!! We had no service so we had to guess and make a decision to where we thought the beach was! About almost another half mile, we started to second guess AGAIN. This was def. a God moment because it was getting dark and everyone seemed a little worried. I thought, I better start praying because I’m starting to feel a little scared. I quietly called out God’s name. Then out of nowhere this couple showed up and gave us directions ', 'Awesome hiking place, must to go!', 'Go early. Start at Stinson Beach to Muir Woods.  Reward yourself with the beach at the end.  It’s beautiful.  Excellent trail for running.  Saw one snake and it was little.  Not overly busy but later on the way back more hikers around.  It was beautiful.', 'I did this hike solo and it was such a beautiful experience. I recommend buying the Dipsea trail map they have at the visitor center in Muir Woods. It helped me get through the whole day without much trouble figuring out the trail because it can get complicated at some points considering there are so many trails in Muir Woods. Start out surrounded by redwoods. End your journey resting your tired ass toes in the Pacific at Stinson Beach. Just to finish off at the beach was one of the most phenomenal feelings and moments of my life. Currently writing this review at Stinson beach because I couldn’t pass up the moment to capture my energy from this hike.', 'loved this trail! It had such diverse terrain and views.  It was absolutely beautiful!  It is a difficult trail though for sure.  I am from Colorado and hike all over the place but this is now one of my favorite hikes!', 'Dipsea half marathon was muddy, raining, tough', 'This is one of the most scenic and beautiful trails I have ever run! However, it is also one of the most difficult. Many of the uphills and some downhills are not run-able as they are too steep, but there are some stretches that  finally level out enough to run normally. This trail has become one of my favorite training grounds for trail running!', 'Fabulous!!! Amazing trail! Challenging at times, but so much fun! Loved every step and all the different sceneries with wonderful vegetation. From the tall trees to the foggy wet areas, mountain and ocean views, so much to see and explore!! Make sure you buy your $1.00 map at the visitor center. The free map is not as detailed as the one you buy. Wear layers as the mornings are cool, but you get warm fast going up the trail. Enclosed shoes are a must. Bring extra water, sunscreen, a hat and get ready to enjoy nature, listen to everything that nature has to offer. We did the round hike, out and back. We had a wonderful lunch at Stinson Beach, walked up to the beach and then headed back to the trail. Our return was a lot faster than our first part of the hike going there. Go early, right when the park opens, the morning fog is beautiful!!!!', ""The mountain so nice, we climbed it twice. It's pretty steep on both ends. The forest is really beautiful, and I suggest going early bc the fog makes it particularly nice. I love all the big trees."", ""Incredibly gorgeous hike! Started at Stinson Beach and went to Muir Woods and back (best option for parking/there's a bus that goes from Stinson Beach to Sausalito). Great views of the Redwoods throughout the hike! Would rate it more as moderate though: there was an extended climb of scares, then another turning back from Muir Woods, but otherwise it wasn't too difficult."", 'Went from Stinson to Muir Woods and back. Recommend this way as you start and end at beach and it’s easier for parking and public transit.', 'Amazing trail. Lots of stairs and climbing in the woods where no sunshine gets through. Your thighs will be burning. *disclaimer* if you make it all the way to Stinson beach please note there is no bus Uber or Lyft in that town to take you back after the 9 miles lol. There is only one taxi in that small creepy town but the beach is beautiful. No cell reception either. Experienced hikers only.', 'I did a modified version of this trail. I took the Dipsea Trail to Ben Johnson Trail to Bohemian Grove Trail to  the Main Trail past the Cathedral Grove to the Bootjack Trail to Pantoll campground to John Davis Trail back to Stinson Beach.  Nice variety of views, great work out too.  Roughly 13 miles, 3000ft up and 2700ft down.', 'Literally the best hike I’ve ever taken in my life.  No joke.  Did an up and back with my sister and we decided to take another loop route down from Muir Woods.  Followed the stream up to the top of the ridge then back down. Amazing ocean views. Diverse vegetation. And of course unforgettable walk around the giant redwoods in Muir Woods.  One for the memory books.', 'Amazing views all the way through! We did this Trail counterclockwise since we couldn’t find parking at Muir Woods. Beautiful nevertheless!', 'Fascinating trail, it looks like someone has done gardening throughout the trail , if you go from Stinson beach to Mill valley, it’s steep', 'Amazing historic trail going through the woods, grassy hilly pastures and along the coast.  I parked on the highway and walked down and then on the way back took the matt Davis trail up and connected to old mine trail to get back to the dipsea.  That was about 15 miles and worth it', 'Wow! Started off surrounded by giant redwoods and Sequoias, ended surrounded by the ocean. A beautiful hike. Very challenging going up and over the mountain and lots of stairs in parts. Only went out...not back (that would have been a bit crazy for my family). Loved every second of this trail!', 'The only way to the trail head we could find is through the main park entrance and then taking bridge number 4 and Ben Johnson trail up where it intersected with Dipsea trail. We followed the Dipsea trail sign after that but it looped and we noticed from Garmn navigation device that we were only a mile away from the car at some point. So we had an option of taking the road and coming back to the car or going back the same way we came in. So most probably we were on a sort of different route but still enjoyed climbing up and later descending in redwood forest as well as distance Pacific views from the top.

Do note reservations are required ahead of time to park at the lot. We had to park at a different trailhead and backtrack to Dipsea.', 'Awesome Trail. I would rate this trail as moderate.', 'Step up to breathtaking views of this beautiful earth and feel one with our natural habitat on the Dipsea Trail. This was our first real Marin hike; definitely the gateway drug to other hikes in Marin/Mill Valley. Been going every weekend since. Just know you can’t get an Uber at Stinson beach.', 'This trail is awesome! Can get very tiring with the ups and downs, but there are stairs built in to some parts. It goes in and out of trees and open areas. Great views', 'Nice trail but only did one way.  One part of the trail was overgrown.  Took public transit to go back to Muir Woods visitors center.  Doable with a 8 month old.', 'Great trail...not as difficult as I expected. Lots of wildlife early in the morning before lots of people show up. Took about 3 hrs to complete with a few stops in between for photos.  Very rewarding finish at Stinson Beach. If you have time hit The Siren Canteen on the beach to ""refuel"".', 'We started the hike from Muir Woods, parked at the Muir Woods Monument overflow parking. Tip: arrive early (7-8AM) to avoid the tourist crowds that fill up the lots quick. The hike begins at around mile 3-4 of the “Dipsea Race”. It is a steep 1,300+ foot climb thru the beautiful wilderness, frigid and moist in the cold months, hot and dry in the summer months. The trail intertwines with the fire road, either one is fine to take, but the true Dipsea Trail offers more shade. Once you summit at a point called “Cardiac”, there are sweeping views and a small pit stop with a water fountain. This marks your descent to Stinson beach, about 3.5 miles. You enter the abyss of moss covered trees and towering redwoods. Descending down 100+++ steps, a little muddy and slippery. When you arrive at a foot bridge, go left, and continue to follow signs to Stinson Beach. At this point you have about 1.5 miles left! Enjoy your time at the beach, take a dip, have a bite to eat because you’re about to do it all over again, in reverse!! Then upon returning to Muir Woods, you would have completed the “Double Dipsea!”', 'Unbelievable views of the Pacific and SF.  The trail is diverse going from densely wooded to standing on the sand with the waves crashing.  Stinson Beach is a bit of a tourist trap with restaurants and gift shops which could be good or bad depending on what is desired.  The trail was heavily trafficked.  I had to stop multiple times to allow runners and mountain bikers to pass safely.  If you access the trail from the overflow parking lot you can avoid the $10 entrance fee at the main gate.  Overall a must have experience.', 'Absolutely gorgeous. Incredibly foggy day added to the magic of this beautiful place, definitely where the fairies live!', 'Hiked from Mill Valley to beach and back.  Beautiful trail with enough variety to keep it interesting.  Great to have the beach as a midday break.', ""Beautiful and majestic. Highly recommended.

No ubers or cabs available "", '', 'We had a hard time finding a parking spot as we came around 9:30am. About half of the hike was shaded, but I would recommend shades and a hat for sun protection.

Check out the Parkside Cafe.', '05-23 Began around 12pm, weather was perfect (as compared to Sacramento heat of high 90s). We hiked/trail ran to Stinson Beach in under 2 hours. Near the beach, there are several cute shops and food places with healthy options. It is beautiful out there, will surely come back again! It is a good idea to head back around 5pm because the way back is not easy. We took Steep Ravine - Stapelveldt - Ben Johnson - Hillside trails when returning. Do that if you feel like the way there was not enough of a workout. The stairs on Steep Ravine certainly gave me a kick, but I loved it!', ""Hard hike so start early! Enjoy at least an hour's rest at Stinson Beach before the arduous climb back from seal level. Round trip took 4.5 hrs at a fast pace including an hour at Stinson. Also, I think you can get back to Muir Woods via Marin transit + a shuttle bus if you decide to beach bum it."", 'Get back before dark!', 'The beginning of the trail was a little hard to find since the entrance at the parking lot is shut down due to the rain storms. This trail has everything you would look for, beautiful redwoods, waterfalls, open valley, and ending at Stinson beach is a nice reward. Overall it was about 10 miles because of the slight detour. Be prepared for mud (at the moment)! Well worth the run.', 'Love this trail! Breathtaking in its views and difficulty! ', 'Amazing trail! My first solo hike, I did 12.8 miles. The trails were easy to follow at most points and beautiful views that range from forestry to meadow views to costal and in between. I will definitely be back to explore this area more.', 'One of my favorite trails. Some fallen trees from the recent storm made it extra adventurous this past weekend (12/18/16). Beautiful as always, with frost everywhere and icy muddy puddles.', 'Fabulous hike. Start from the auxiliary Muir Woods parking lot and you will see signs for Dipsea Trail. Once on it you will wind through the highlands cross crossing the fire road until you hit the woods. This is where it gets a little steep but the trail is well groomed and easy to navigate. I went on a weekday so the traffic was non existent. Took about 5 hours of consistent walking to cover the 10ish miles all the way down to Stetson Beach which is a sleepy town w cafes, etc. my tracker said I climbed 199 stories of stairs and took about 22K steps. Enjoy!!', 'Love love love this trail. It is intense.', 'I guess we did the ""Double Dipsea"" though it was unclear where the true trailhead was so we started from the Muir Woods Visitor Center extended parking lot (free for hikers).  We hiked down to Stinson beach and back.  Took lots of photos along the trail and even enjoyed our packed lunches at the park.  Overall time about 6:30hrs, and AllTrails clocked us with just under 12 miles.  The first 3hrs of the trail was a bit muddy and rainy, we were both soaked!  Come prepared.  It was so beautiful though, especially with the mist!  Can\'t wait to do it again.  Tip:  Pay attention to the trail markers!  The Dipsea crossed with several other trails along the way.IG @niiimz_', 'Amazing', ""We took the Dipsea Trail out of Stinson Beach to Muir Woods then to Muir Beach. All those steps definitely woke me up first thing in the morning. It was a steep hike for the first hour or two going in this direction. It was absolutely beautiful. I felt like once we were at the top of the ridge we were winding up through a magical redwood forest before we saw other hikers. We hooked up with the Ben Johnson trial to get further in to Muir woods. We came upon a lot of other people at that point. It's an amazing trail."", 'A really good trail. Great way to spend the day.  Lots of activities on both end either at Muir Woods or Stinson and you can take Steep Ravine back to break up the monotony of an out-n-back.', 'Loved it but the last part is hard on the knees.Take a map and a lot of water.', 'Loved the trail and the ocean view...', 'The trail is relatively flat and there were some good sights but it was tiring.', 'Picking up the Dipsea Trail at Muir Woods is a great option because the parking is free and pretty safe as well as mostly shaded plus it is such a beautiful area.    The trail is in good condition, steep in parts but very doable even for the occasional hiker.  Bring protection from the sun even on cloudy days.  The trail is usually wide and when you get to Stinson Beach lots of places to eat and shop.  Highly recommend.', 'This was my 1st hike ever and I completed the double bipsea. It was super tough and challenging both physically and mentally. I will definitely go again. I loved the cool drizzle in the  morning.', 'Beautiful views make the hills worthwhile, with a finish at the beach!', 'Tough going in places but loved the views and finished the day at the Parkside  Cafe  and a quick walk over to the beach.

If you can't park at Muir woods, you can start from the beach and do it the other way around"", 'This trail was absolutely amazing. I deviated many times because there was so much to see. I ended up doing over 15 miles because of this. The climb up steep ravine is unbelievable, like your in an ancient rain forest. Then down through Muir Woods, the redwood forest where you feel quite insignificant.an awesome experience', 'Started @ Muir Woods & took Canopy Trail to Lost Trail to Plevin Cut to Alice Eastwood Trail to Bootjack Trail to TCC Trail to (finally) Dipsea Trail to Stinson Beach to Mt Davis Trail to end up at Pan Tol Ranger Station', 'Somewhat challenging but beautiful hike! We parked at the visitor center and had to make our way up the deer creek fire road at the start because of the bridge being closed off for now. It was a muddy climb, but well worth the view of the Pacific and woods. The second half of the hike is down stairs and along creeks that lead you to Stinson beach. We later hiked the (challenging at the start) Matt Davis trail which connected us back to Muir Woods. Great day of hiking.', ""Hiked until the fog rolled in...had a blast!Next time we'll start earlier"", 'Nice view of the pacific when it is not cloudy', 'Great early morning hiking trail.', 'Rough hike but well worth it.', ""It's really worth the time to do this trail if you've never hiked it.  It's probably the most memorable trail of Muir Woods in my opinion.  It was ten years go, but from what I remember the 'difficulty' of it really just surrounded the fact that it was incline all the way up and decline all the way down which stressed the leg muscles (the fatigue shakes on the way down).  But still worth it."", 'Challenging, beautiful vistas.', 'Great trail we did 13 miles to the beach great views and challenging up hills.', 'A lot of tourists and a very crowded trail.', ""It's a long trail to work on , actually I got into the Muir Woods park and started several trail, the trial took me around two hours to finish , the time when I went up to the summit it has sunset, only the top view is very impressive, the other view just some redwoods."", 'A ""classic"" in the Bay Area. Not a particularly scenic or spectacular hike but interesting diversity of surrounidngs including, of course, the viewpoint with sweeping views of the Marin Headlands, San Francisco and the Bay (assuming the fog did not crash the party).', 'This was a fun hike. Pretty much straight uphill to the vista point, then straight back downhill towards Stinson Beach. We started by dropping a car off at Stinson Beach then headed back toward Muir Woods (Fair warning - To get to the beach from CA 101 is very coastal...aka if you get car sick at all, good luck! Going in, dropping the car off, getting into the other car, and heading straight back up the same road made me quite sick). There is a turn off about 2/3rds of the way back toward 101 with a sign that says ""Muir Woods"" this is a much shorter, less winding way, but you\'ll come up to the park from the opposite way. If it\'s really crowded, you\'ll see a bunch of cars parked on the road as you get closer to the park, I\'d suggest to go ahead and park when you get a spot. If there\'s a lot of cars on the road, it means the parking lot and overflow lot are full. We parked a full mile out of the main entrance (oh well, more hiking!). We started within the park ($7 entrance fee) because it\'s just so pretty, then took bridge 4 up to the Ben Johnson Trail. Note: the actual vistor area was extremely crowded (we were there about 10), but once you\'re on the actual trail, very few people are around. Took that us up (and up and up and up) to the Dipsea Trail. Took that one up to the vista point, it was very foggy when we went so no view for us. :(  and then back down into the forest (GORGEOUS!) and eventually out to the beach. There are a lot of stairs you have to climb down and for the shorter people like me, they\'re cumbersome. Not even, old, some are missing, etc. so just be careful and you\'ll be fine. So much fun! And you get to end your hike at a lovely, sandy beach! That is, unless, you didn\'t drop a car off and have to do round trip. I believe there is some form of a shuttle, though we didn\'t rely on it, so I\'m not sure how reliable it is! And you couldn\'t pay me to do that windy drive in a bus :/', 'This is a good hike to get in several different views.  There is a strange part where you have to cross a highway but I have noticed this is the case with several of the state park hikes.

Great spots at the falls for a picnic and very kid and dog friendly. The upper and middle trail isn’t good for strollers so stick to the lower falls trail.

Needless to say, we didn't make it very far without feeling overheated. We decided to try it out New Year's Day. It was a perfect day to go see the falls. I would definitely say it's much easier in the wintertime, but if you go early enough in the summer you should be good and you'll find great spots for swimming. It is quite a bit of a drive from Yuba City or Grass Valley, but I like that because less people are apt to go there.

The reviews are correct that it gets hot along the trail, although there was quite a bit of shade.  It isn't a hike I'd like to do in the summer months; there are plenty of swimming holes in Northern CA closer to my home. It's more of a walk than a hike anyway as there were only a few uphills, etc. Deer, bear, and maybe cougar tracks seen in the dirt trail.  The road in was gravel and washboard but didn't need 4 wheel drive. I was fine in my Fiesta.  Did not see anyone else along the trail.  1 hour in, 1 hour out.  Overall a fun walk and a lovely day."", 'This was a beautiful place to ride our horses and there was some shade, wide trails, and access to water at the falls.

It’s definitely up to you and your enjoyment but due to the heat and very little shade, I recommend getting there earlier. But the sun did feel very nice on my skin ☀️ and don’t forget your sunblock. We took the upper trail that lead to the waterfall. It took us a little over an hour to get to the waterfall then we climbed our way down to swimming hole. The waterfall was very nice but the scenery to the river was gorgeous! I could have spent forever there. One more thing, if you decide to take your pet(s) please check the weather, go as early as possible, and take a lot of water. We ran into a few very hot and dehydrated pets.

I can only imagine the intense heat in summer.\nA couple of drawbacks to this trail:  Cow poop and its smell everywhere until the trail splits into three (about a mile and a half).  Encountered some agressive cows on the lower trail and had to run from them.  Picked up a tick, but got it off before it latched on.

There is very little shade and few options to get into the creek until you are about half a mile from the falls. There are some moderately steep spots, which weren't bad but in the heat seemed mountainous. The falls were very pretty and the pool below them looked inviting but it was a steep climb down to them and back up to get out. Having our dog, we didn't venture down there. We ended up going back to the little pool that we first came to and sat there for awhile to cool down before hiking out. The pool is shallow (an adult can touch the bottom) and felt so refreshing. Beware... there are little fish in this pool that will give you a test-taste. Doesn't hurt but it startled us. :0) My advice: plan to start hiking by 8am. Take plenty of water. Don't stay too long or stay til dusk because 100 degrees hiking out feels like 150. Please, if you take your dog, make SURE they are wearing booties!!!!! The ground is too hot, there is not much shade, and the stickers and fox tails are abundant. We did not and should have (and usually do) known better.

There\'s the bridge you go over once you park and go to the right to start the trail, then after about 20 minutes there is a Y....I would reccomend to go RIGHT, it\'s more shade and along the river I didn\'t realize it until I was coming back. I went LEFT at the Y and didn\'t get a chance to see the lower falls and ended up straight at the upper falls, where I jumped the 90ft waterfall. I would advise against it especially for inexperienced cliff jumpers. So, after jumping I immediately wanted to go home because my body was in shock. If I would have went right at the Y I would have had a chance to explore before the upper falls but the LEFT at the Y will take you on a dry skinny trail with no ""view"" like everyone says and no river access until you reach the top.

I recommend starting very early as a majority of the trail is exposed. Bring your swimsuit and water shoes, if you plan on going during the summer months. We took a refreshing dip in a swimming pool down below the lower Falls. Some of the trail is made up of dirt roads and some of it drops to a single person trail. We saw beautiful scenery and enjoyed every minute of it. We will definitely be coming back again. The only downside is the car ride getting to the trail head is extremely bumpy and must be driven extremely slow.', ""The trail itself was lacking and the last 10 miles of driving was a ridiculously bumpy unpaved road. but The waterfall is gorgeous though!!

The area is closed on occasion without notice for hunters :/ which must be super disappointing to anyone  coming from outside the area to hike. This really is a local hike for those in Grass Valley or down in Yuba City/Marysville. I wouldn't drive from outside the area for this. The local region is HOT (in the summer), low lying foothills and central oak woodland. 80% of the trail is exposed to sun so bring water, hats, and sunscreen. \n\nCattle graze throughout the land, contributing to the already polluted Dry Creek. Mining has left this creek laden with heavy metals such as arsenic and coppr (this area was mined for copper before regulations were put in place). Swim at your own risk. The water is NOT safe to swim in, yet people keep coming. The trail is heavily trafficked, flat and wide enough for ranchers to drive. Some reports of break-ins at the trailhead. Unleashed dogs on the trail are common and sometimes problematic, owners don't pick up poop. \n\nIf you can get past all this, there is some inherent serenity in the rolling foothill woodland hills and waterfall. 5 miles round trip. It's good for a couple hours or less."", ""Incredibly beautiful view! The views make the distance seem like a piece of cake. I am not an avid hiker but I didn't have an issue with this trail, it was a little steep at times but it wasn't bad. Definitely a dog friendly trail, most people kept their dogs off leash but would have the courtesy to get a hold of their dog as you're walking by.

As other have commented, it is not very difficult but it is a decent length at 5 miles.

I try to take my nieces every year and it is definitely doable for kids although they may tire out towards the end but that is to be expected. Very beautiful, especially when the hills are green. It works perfectly if you start the trail around mid-morning and pack a lunch; by the time you make it to the falls it will be just the right time to eat and there are rocks you can sit on for a picnic with a great view.

Finally made it to the falls, about a 2 hour hike from the car.  Beautiful, with more water than expected at this time of the summer.  My sister braved the huge boulders and climbed down to the swimming hole.  Took her a long time!  And she said getting back up was very challenging.  On the way back we found the small swimming hole, the one we meant to head for in the first place!  So at the fork, there's a 3rd option: the road on the very right.

When you get to a large empty area and the wide purple road goes one way and then there are two narrow trails- one marked upper falls and one marked lower falls well I can tell you it doesn't really matter which one you take because you end up coming out at the same spot at the top. If you look around at the top of the falls there is a small narrow trail that leds down to the large swimming hole below but it's steep and rocky. I watched many guys help there ladies down, but if you make it you can definitely go for a swim. On the back side of the falls there is a small semi steep path that goes down to a rocky area that is before the falls falls- a few small water holes to soak your feet. That's where we hung out.

Did not see anyone out there besides on the way back. Very secluded. Overall very pretty. We went on the lower trail and there was a short part of the trail which looked like it was washed away.

Hike down but be careful the rocks are beyond slick - have fu.', ""Drove here heading North on 65.  My mapping program was correct on the route (but way off on ETA because it thought you could drive all the way to the falls itself).  The best route would be through the base (not sure if that is allowed) so the mapping programs all route around it.  I've attached the GPS coordinates for the parking lot on Google Maps so you map from your starting point.  The last few miles are dirt road, but the road is very hard packed.  We were in a regular car and there was no issues.  Just before the parking lot we did see hunters unpacking (including their rifles) and there was signs posted that hunting was allowed on the trail, but we did not see any hunters (or deer).  Also heard no gunfire on the hike, but from the parking lot you can hear the range off in the distance.  The trail itself has great trail signs (as there are some interesting looking offshoots this is important).\n\nThe hike itself was great.  We started off at around 10:30AM and did not see a soul until we were nearly done our hike (perfect).  There were patches of rolling grassland, followed by treed areas, followed by rocky outcroppings.  If you don't like the view, walk a half mile.  The area around the falls is very rugged (which is good, you are in nature) so keep you kids close.  On a hot summer day I would be tempted to go for a swim.  Except for right in front of the falls the trail is very wide and smooth (not any extreme hills).\n\nI would call it an easy and worthwhile hike.  The few miles of gravel road and relative remoteness make for a quiet hike where you can really feel like you are all alone in the world."", 'Kind of difficult to find while driving there, but so worth it!!

Always a plus."", ""This was a fun and easy hike. Getting to the hike location is the confusing part. The parking lot is not marked we just did a lot of guessing. We went towards the upper falls. It's true that this place is haunted since I heard voices and seen things out of the ordinary on the way up and of course my dog sensed it. Got to the top of the 100ft fall. We climbed down to the stream of water & to the tip of the 100ft fall with our Siberian Husky. A bit scary but we were able to manage. My dog loved it by the time we got to the water. The hike down was fairly easy and made a few stops to the other pool of water locations. We decided we will just run down to the car to get a good workout in. Definitely a good place to get a jog in."", 'Easy and fun hike!  Our kids (6, 8, & 12) had a good time.  Much of the hike is on a dirt road with little shade.

As some have mentioned, the drive in is on a dirt road. It may be a bit bumpy but isn't anything that should stop you from going. The hike begins on a gated dirt road and later becomes dirt trail. The stream is beautiful and a great place to explore and find a picnic spot to hang out a have a bite to eat. In the spring the water is very cold, but on a warm day can still make for a nice place to swim and cool off. The waterfalls also make for a beautiful place to stop and enjoy the view. The only downside to this hike in my opinion are the crowds on some weekends. I carried out a backpack full of discarded beer and water bottles the first time I did this hike."", ""The drive in is rocky and long. The hike itself is an hour there and an hour back.

Some parts are out in the open and others are shaded, so make sure you travel with sunscreen. In February there weren\'t many flowers or  leaves on the poison oak - be carefully, even without leaves it can cause a rash! \n\nOn the way to the falls we took the creek trail ( not far after crossing the bridge and to the right). Again there is some cover some out in the open. At one point we had to cross a small creek. Nothing too bad as there wasn\'t much dribbling through it. There were a few spot where we had to navigate over/under trees and some rock climbing to get through.

There weren\'t many other people there other than our group.\n\nOnce you make it back to the main road there are again two trails to get to the falls. Follow the road to get to the look out point and have a bite to eat behind the ""safety fence"" and enjoy the sound of the falls and the views. You can also choose to take the much narrower and steeper trail on the side of the canyon next to the creek/falls. I was told there are some spots of rock climbing and serious prayer to hope you don\'t slip and fall. \n\nAgain there several trails to come back on. If you took a more strenuous one going up take the road back, but it does get a little boring as I said its pretty flat and not always a lot to see.', ""This is a trail definitely one that you can take the kids on and even do some exercise on.

dried up. So summer time is not the time to go! would bet spring time would be best!', ""Awesome!!!! Nobody was there. (on a Sunday afternoon). Keep in mind it's a dirt path off the main road and there's a lot of ditches. When you park, you walk for about a quarter off a mile, then you start going down hill."", 'December on this trail is awesome. No one around, but still able to make out the path. Waterfall is iced over but scrambling up it wasn’t too bad. Really enjoyed the peace and different falls you hit as you climb.', 'Trail was easy to follow. The waterfall was running nice due to the recent snow/rain fall. Had a couple decent photo ops. Overall, if you’re a beginner, you won’t find this trail too difficult.', 'Very nice falls and trails however there are lack of guidance signs to get to the starting points and also to the destination points... people may get lost if they do have maps or offline navigation, trail does not get signal.', 'Visited Bassi today.  Beautiful as always. Not much water but what there was was clear and crisp.', 'Great little walk.', 'Easy enough for the kids! Great hike and such a beautiful spot!', 'I hiked the trail on 8/10/18. I enjoy destination hikes, especially waterfall hikes. I had no idea what to expect at the end of the trail. I was mildly disappointed that Bassi Falls was just a trickle this time of the year. The trail on AllTrails was very different from the route that I took. The trail is in the process of restoration and if it weren’t for trail markings I probably would have been lost. I had trouble finding the trail back to the trailhead. I had to rely on shoe prints and paths that looked to have had heavy foot traffic. Hopefully they make better trail markings for the rerouted path. However, I will definitely come back to see Bassi Falls in all its glorious flow, perhaps in the Spring time.', 'Can be moderate for some due to altitude and heat,  but so so so worth it.  Amazing woodsy beginning and then a drop down to beautiful pools and falls.', 'Walked this trail on 7/22. Pros: probably great for kids, easily accessible from where we stayed, and had some small pools of water to put our feet in towards the end. Cons: very little to see along the way, broken glass along the path, and the waterfall was just barely flowing.', 'Nice trail but very little shade, lots of gravel and rocks and no waterfalls in mid July.  On a blistering hot day you better wear sun screen, have a wide brimmed hat and have a good pair of hiking boots.  Difficult to locate the trailhead if you have not been there before as signage is poor and the elevation will wear you out quickly unless you are accustomed to hiking in the mountains. Very few people for a Saturday afternoon.', ""This trail was really nice.  Easy to follow and most driving on paved road to get there.  The water was not flowing like crazy (it's July, so  . . .), but there were plenty of pools to splash in and get our feet/legs wet.  The only reason I dropped it to 4 stars was that there were a lot of places with broken glass lying around, and I had concerns about our dog.  She was fine, but it was not a pleasant part of the trip."", 'love this trail! take a bathing suit', 'beautiful hike and and great swimming holes. hardly anyone out there on Monday. The waters low but the falls are still flowing and the pools are safe for kids. what a wonderful day!!', 'This was an awesome hike! Easy enough for your dog, and great exercise for yourself. The water fall is beautiful and there’s a few good spots to swim in, as well.', 'things were clearly labeled and it smelled like Christmas tree ', 'Really enjoyed this hike. Went mid-week (6/27) and it was still fairly crowded at the falls. Water still flowing over the falls. The scenery is amazing.', 'Beautiful falls. Easy hike, doable for little ones who don’t like to hike. Spring time when water is moving. Beautiful!', 'Very fun quick hike, no stars guns off of ice house rd so it can be hard to find. The turn off is after the silver creek bridge. Stay to the right. There are two parking areas off the gravel road. The first is easy and best for regular cars, the second lot to the right and down farther is washed out.', 'Beautiful, easy hike for most.', 'Simply beautiful. Loved walking by the water at different points on the path.', 'Nice trail. About .7 in there is a teaser cascading fall where there are some pools to swim. At the Falls itself, there are several swimming pools—wish I had my suit! Falls still running pretty good on June 14.', 'Nice easy hike and beautiful. My children loved it. Be warned to get to the falls is a VERY steep entrance. And lots of rocks at the end. Careful with little ones.', 'Lots of water still flowing!', 'adorable trail and great waterfall views ! easy for all ages... just be wary of slippery rocks and rushing water parts of the year !', 'Awesome adventure trail, short and sweet hike up to the base of the falls, then a fun cairn led scramble up to the top of the granite overlook.  The access road is best in a high clearance vehicle, but I saw some passenger cars at the trailhead.  Awesome spot for dogs to run and explore.', 'I took my two boys 8 and 12, the trail was a  perfect Adventure. we just mosied along took our time,  made sure to look at all our beautiful surroundings and sure enough we came to the Majestic spot. we sat down and had lunch. It was a wonderful hike!', 'Gorgeous, yet very easy hike', 'Enjoyed this trail. Waterfall looks great right now. Very enjoyable walk for beginners.', 'Beautiful right now! Easy trail, no snow. if you dont want to encounter a lot of people go during the week!', 'Beautiful short hike and the end destination is an amazing lunch spot! Took me around 1.5 hours round trip.

Pretty easy but a great hike. lots of different terrains. The falls are fabulous!', 'There is no access to the parking lot until April so park on the side of Ice House Rd. and walk the rest of the way up to the trail access. A friend and I did this hike on Wednesday morning/afternoon in January and we did not encounter any other hikers along the way. It is really easy to get lost but there are trail markers on the trees on the way up. However, there are not as many trail markers on the way back so I highly recommend downloading the offline map. Easy hike with gorgeous views. will be back in the summer for a swim.', 'This trail was beautiful. You can take a short cut to get to the main trail, but I highly suggest you hike it from the trail marker. When you first drive up to the trail there is a very small parking lot (if you start your hike on the trail at that parking area, that’s the short cut). Off to the right there is a road that continues down the park. The real trail marker starts down that road. You can’t miss the sign.', 'This trail was great! It has beautiful views and it was fun climbing through the rocks at the end. Very little snow and only saw three groups of other hikers. Spent most the hike in solitude.', 'Very easy 2 mile stroll from the parking area. Minimal elevation gain/loss. Waterfall was quite full; there’s actually a smaller but still impressive fall about 2/3 of the way. You can scramble up the side of the falls to get to the top with lovely views. I can see this area being quite popular in the summer, but as of this writing there were only about a dozen or so people on the trail and no snow yet. As others have noted, there are places where the trail is easily lost, but if you’ve downloaded the map for offline use you can easily find your way again. There’s actually a pair of cell towers at the top of a nearby ridge; from the top of the falls I had a clear line of sight and nearly full bars on my mobile!Lots of nearby lakes/reservoirs to explore. Happy trails!', 'Beautiful hike. Sometime the trail was hard to stay on. Look for the hiking signs on the trees if you do get off the trail. Waterfall still going strong 11/12/17.

Wanna go camping there.', 'Super easy trail. Great for the kiddos! We needed a little more of a challenge so we climbed up the side of the fall to the top. That was a beautiful view! ', 'Very serene once you get to the Falls!!!', 'Awesome hike', ""There are two primary ways to get to Bassi Falls.   Option #1 follows the AllTrails description.  Option #2 below is a shortcut that some other reviewers have described.\n\nOption #1\n\nDifficulty: 2/5\nShade: Very little\nTerrain: Soft dirt and granite/rock slabs - not too many loose rocks\nOverall rating: 3/5\n\nTurn right when you see the entrance to Big Silver campground on the right.  Travel down the road. It will dead end into a group camp where there is some parking (but not a lot). If you can't park here, you can park in a small lot at Big Silver campground that is about 0.5 miles from the trailhead.\n\nThe trailhead is marked as Bassi Creek Trail.  The trail itself weaves through ponderosa pines and cedars, and interesting rock formations. Even though you are in a forest, there is not enough cover to provide shade, so bring sun protection - it felt VERY hot even though it was in the low 80s the day I was hiking.  \n\nThe trail itself is not very difficult, but on a hot day, it will feel more difficult.  There are few places to rest in the shade.\n\nAbout 1.5 miles from the trailhead you will come upon lower Bassi Falls.  There is a large swimming hole and some smaller ones that you can reach by going off of the trail a little.  It is best to go around closer to the actual waterfall and make your way from there (rather than climbing over the rocks that lead up to the base of the falls).  \n\nDon't stop here though, in another 0.5 miles, you will reach upper Bassi falls which has some of the most beautiful swimming spots I've ever seen.  Crystal clear water, rocks, natural steps into the water...all with a view of the waterfall.  You can also make your way and climb up to the top of the falls.\n\nOption #2 (see my recordings to see this option - it is different from AllTrails)\nDifficulty: 1/5\nShade: Very little\nTerrain: Soft dirt and granite/rock slabs\nOverall rating: 3/5\n\nIf you arrive early enough, you can turn right across from the Big Silver Campground.  On this dirt road, you will see a road veer to the left that travels up.  If you take this road, you will reach a dead end that is the trailhead to a shortcut to (upper) Bassi Fall.  There are about 5-7 spaces to park, depending on how creative you're willing to be with parking on the side of the road.\n\nFrom the trailhead to upper Bassi Falls is about 0.5 miles.  Most of the trail is over granite rock.  There isn't really an obvious trail, but if you keep walking, you'll hear the falls and eventually get to the water. Once the trail open onto the rock, try to stay straight, and you'll get to the base of the falls.\n\nThe rock formations are really interesting, but most visitors will be anxious to get to the water. The trail itself completely exposed.  So it will feel hot.  Once you reach the falls, there are several swimming holes to take a dip in and cool off.  If you arrive early (around 9am), you'll have the place to yourself.  By 10:30-11am, be ready for crowds.  \n\nThe swimming holes are among the most beautiful I've seen anywhere.  I posted several pictures.  About one mile down from upper Bassi Falls is lower Bassi Falls with beautiful swimming holes as well. The ones at the upper Bassi Falls are more beautiful, but the lower falls have gorgeous spots to swim and play as well (see my pictures).\n\nFor both options, bring lots of sun protection.  I wore a hat and sunblock.  My husband did the same.  He spent a lot of time in the water and definitely got some sun on his back/shoulders. I did not need bug spray, but in spring, you might need some.  I did the trails in trail shoes - you don't need hardcore hiking boots or anything because the trail doesn't have much loose rock or difficult terrain.\n\nWhile the waterfalls and swimming holes on this trail are terrific (5/5), the trail itself is more like 2/5.  While there are interesting rock formations, it is very exposed without much to look at until you reach the falls.  This is why I rated it overall as 3/5"", 'gorgeous! A lot of helpful info on this site. Take icehouse road up past Sunset/Fashoda campgrounds. Turn right (across from Big Silver group camp) onto a paved road that turns to gravel. make your first left and if you get there early, follow the road til it ends and park. The trail starts right after where you park. Bring swimsuits! Great for picnicking and swimming. we got a bit lost on the way back but found our way. my 8 year old was struggling on the way back to the car. Our dog had no problem.  My advice is to note landmarks so you follow the right path back to the right parking area. There is a lower parking area but I recommend using the one at the top (end of road).', ""Awsome water falls. Kinda of hard to find where to park. Once you pass the bridge make your first right than your first left and follow the dirt road up. There are no signs that say bassi falls but it's not that hard to find once you see the camp grounds and cars parked. It can be a 4 mile hike round trip but we only hiked about 2 miles round trip. super easy to do with the family of all ages. Highly recommended but also a short hike for the drive so it's 50/50. Alot if water from the snow melt, kind if busy on a Saturday but you can definitely still do your own thing without any problems. Bring swim suits and a water camera for awsome pictures."", 'Beautiful hike. Plan to bring water shoes, sunscreen, and a backpack to carry your things. Also, remember where you enter the falls. We could not find the trail back (we were only lost for a few minutes) but it is a very small path up. We were too excited about the Falls to pay attention.', 'Nice trail but very busy on the weekend', 'Difficult to find the starting point of the trail (right parking lot). But the trail is great and easy. Bring swim suits!', ""Beautiful falls and swimming holes galore! Not at all busy mid week in July...6 cars in the parking lot, felt like we were all on our own most of the hike. Keep hiking up the trail, don't veer off the trail too soon to go swimming. It is well worth the longer hike to get up towards the upper falls and discover some lovely, swimming holes."", 'Easy trail with beautiful running water all along it.', 'Great spot. Beautiful area. It was an easy enough hike for my friend and I to do with her 4 year old and 1 year old twins. Pretty trails and great swimming holes near the falls. We went mid week so parking was fine, although we heard it gets packed on the weekends.', 'Great hike!!  Was a really warm day Kinda hard on dog as parts of hike are in full sun. Still lots of water coming down falls!!  Will do again in fall!!  And snow shoe in winter', 'Easy hike with beautiful views!', 'Hiked 7/3/17, Windy roads, if ur sitting in the back you can get motion sickness. Hard to find, but easy to remember route for next trip. Slow down as u pass silver creek bridge,and you will turn right into the unmarked dirt road right across the street fm Big Silver Group Campsite, there\'s ""not"" a sign that says ""Bassi Falls"".

It was even better. Water running all down the rocks and filling the pools. I did notice a ranger walking around which is great. \n\nDrive up Ice house road and go all the way up past Union Valley and turn right onto the dirt road across from the Big Silver Group Campsite. Then take the first left. We continued up this road a little ways until we found a large area to park in since we were in a large truck. \n\nIf you decide to drive to the top and park in the parking lot, or anywhere close to it, beware it is very tight and hard to turn around in and most likely already full. From where we parked it was probably a 20 minute walk to the beginning of the trail. My 7 and 3 year old nephews went with us and they did great!', 'We had a hard time finding it initially but took a road off the main road and luckily found it!', 'Awesome Falls, Easy hike, Cold water & Cold Beer!', ""Amazing!!  Spectacular!!!  Totally worth it!!!  Very impressive falls!!  DEFINITELY hike to the top of the fall.!!  Don't miss out on seeing these beautiful falls from the top!!  It is a short, but climbing trail, just to the left of the falls.  It is not a super clear trail, but easy enough to figure out, and not far.  Do it!!  When you get to the top, and spend some time exploring and taking in the views and the falls, continue on up along the creek to the upper falls.  Not as big or impressive, but not far, an easy walk, and no reason not to once you are up there!  Hiker beware, the dirt road to the parking area is very rough, and easy to miss, but don't give up on finding it.  After some trial and error, persistence, and deductive reasoning, you'll finding.  Parking is VERY limited, get there early, or you will add at least a mile to your hike!  Do this hike!!  Plan on at least two hours.  Bring water and snacks.  I want to do this one again!!"", 'Easy hike to gorgeous views of bassi falls, highly recommend!', ""Very kid friendly.  When you think you've hit the falls...keep walking.  The actual falls are just a little bit farther.  Great backpacking at the top of the falls with a few established campsites including fire pits.  Get a fire permit, dispersed camping at it's best.  Great day on the river with a gorgeous sunset from top of the falls."", 'After we drove over the bridge on ice house we turned left and parked in the ""cyclists parking"". We should have turned right and drove down the dirt road for a bit. This made it a little difficult for us to find the trail but if we would have driven the right way, there is a sign that says bassi falls. Other than that, the hike was pretty easy (my 4 year old made it most of the 4 miles) and the falls at the end were beautiful. Sitting next to it with the mist felt so amazing.', ""This was my first hike in a long long time. We started at the bottom of ice house road and hiked a mile up until we hit the lower bassi trails (got lost in some places, not used to reading maps XD). Instead of keeping the road to bassi falls trail, we took the lower bassi falls route and enjoyed the scenery. The trees were humongous and the wildlife was cute. We ended at the falls and hung near the water. The rapids were strong so we didn't go in the water, but it was so clear and cold. Tasty too! Best water I tasted! During our hike back we decided to go ahead and hike into the woods and take a shortcut. We stopped at campsites and enjoyed the wind and the trees. Crossed the stream via a downed tree ( isn't Mother Nature nice ) and made it all the way back to the beginning. It was like a 4 mile hike and we are exhausted, but it was fun and mentally pleasing. 5 stars. Do it"", 'AMAZING', 'Great trail!!!  Well marked and mostly shaded.  My Son and I had a blast!  One of our new favorite places.', 'Getting there was not trivial. Google maps send us the wrong way. The hike itself was easy and the sights are A+ right now due to abundance of water.', 'The Hike was well worth it!', 'Went to bassi falls today and it was amazing. The falls were fast n furious and it was fun climbing around the rocks. It gets warm in the afternoon and would suggest not waiting much more into summer. So worth it and would highly recommend it.', 'This hike is one of the best when you consider how simple the walk in is. The Falls look amazing right now (6/3 )with more water than I have seen in a long time.', 'Gorgeous view!

I recommend hiking in from the road instead of parking so you have a longer hike and get to soak in the views. Dog friendly.', 'Hiked this 7/22/16 and it was lovely! Based on ranger recommendations for my car (06 mustang) I parked at the top of millionaires camp (across from Big Silver Group Camp up a dirt/gravel road) and did the 2 mile hike up to the falls. He said the shorter road was way too aggressive for a car and would bury the suspension. It was my first hike and I did really well. Not too strenuous but challenging enough with various terrain and some incline. The falls had some water that felt great. Trail was clear enough and whenever I doubted if I was going the right way there was a trail marker in sight. It was hot but there was partial shade. Not too trafficked either (especially for Friday afternoon/evening with the trail head being in a campground). Will definitely do it again!!', ""Very short hike! But very pretty. In total, the hike was about 3 miles roundtrip. The directions off this app are a little off, the turn off for the trailhead is a little before these directions designate. When you make this turn off of Ice House Rd it's a dirt road that could get a bit treacherous if you're not in an SUV/Truck. Also you cannot park right at the beginning of trail. So park along the side there's a couple turnouts on the dirt road before the trailhead. Still a good amount of water, no one on the trail at all and we brought our dog who loved the swimming and we enjoyed the swimming too!"", ""The trail is absolutely beautiful you're surrounded in a forest. Not allot of people. The trail is marked but you have to look in the trees where it shows a little symbol of hiker, not really hard to miss. I've only been to the lower part but I will be going back to go through the full hike."", ""The falls were pretty. Part of the trail was a little unclear. We parked at Bassi creek parking lot. We thought we'd take a short cut to towering rock parking lot. It's not a shortcut!

Lots of families & dogs enjoying the pools. If you decide to hike to the top, look out, loose granite, slippery.', 'Went on this trail with a group of 9 people. From first time to experience hikers. we wanted to do the 2 miles hike, so we stopped and asked for directions. Long story short make a right on an unmarked road across from big silver group campground. follow the road to the end, and go down the marked path for more of a easy to follow hike trail. We all loved this place. About 1hr or less hike. we got to see 2 waterfalls. 1 Half way there and a big one at the end. easy hike with a little of incline there. great for kids and animals. we went on a Monday and got there at 2-3pm. barely anyone around until 4-5 when we left.', 'Wish there were signs on Ice house Rd saying where to turn for Bassi Falls. Glad i found it. Was an easy hike. And well worth it. One of my favorite short hikes. A great place to take a friend on their 1st hike or to do that 1st hike alone. Its a well marked path also.', 'think there should be a sign off of ice house road that says where to turn to Bassi Falls. But glad i found it. Its an easy hike and well marked. Well worth it. One of my favorites now. Great place to take a friend on a 1st hike.', 'Great Hike!  I took my wife and 3 kids (ages 4;5&8) and we had a blast!

Definitely going back!', 'Beautiful trail with falls, some parts shaded, you can do 4 miles RT', ""Worth going for sure .... Fantastic pools to play around in for kids or dogs and you can climb up the falls 1/2 way. I'm sure there is a way to the top but we didn't look or try hard. Will be back for sure! Not very well marked but you can find it !"", ""We go here every year. The road has gotten bumpier so you may add some distance to your hike depending on how far down you can get your car on the dirt road, but it's a pretty easy hike. The water flow will truly depend on how the winter has gone and how much snow we have gotten. The flow is really awesome right now. Great spot to spend the day for some sun and a picnic, but be advised right now there seems to be a lot of high altitude bees around."", ""So glad we finally decided to take this hike. The waterfall is beautiful and so is the entire area. This post only mentions the 1/2 mile hike to the falls. We took the 2 mile hike from the Bassi Creek parking area (4 miles RT). The longer trail runs near Bassi Creek and offers many smaller waterfalls along the way to Bassi Falls. I would recommend taking the longer route. It's beautiful and an easy hike. Once you get to Bassi Falls there is water everywhere! This is a great hike for kids and dogs since there are plenty of shallow areas to play in."", 'The road is still closed, so we hiked it. This is a great, perfect time of year for this hike.

Little water', 'Easy, pretty short-totally dog friendly, but not much water right now. 8/2/2015', 'Completed', 'If you are in the area early spring or summer this is a good place to explore.The road to the trail head is rugged, recommend at least awd and/or vehicles with high clearance-Dont go down this road if your towing anything.Parking is limited.If you can get there this is a short hike, easy for adults and if you have kids they should be able to complete it without to much trouble, the return hike up is fairly steep.There is a waterfall at the end of the trail and the crystalline clear water that flows into a series of small pools are great to wade in.Leave the fishing pole at home or in the car, I did not see even a brookie here.Some moron- (s) ? left a substantial amount of trash here the day we visted,beer cans-bottles ect. a good way to get yourself a broken nose or worse if I see you leaving this kinda crap laying around- so pack it in pack it out you scumbags! In the spring snow melt trickles over the exposed granite and the small wildflowers are a pleasure to behold, the creek is fairly safe to swim in though a bit cold.This is a great hike if your passing through or live fairly close to the Eldorado National Forest region.', ""A beautiful short hike to a gorgeous waterfall.

As others have said the trail over Granite slab is not marked but if you listen you can hear the falls... just follow the sound. Water flow was low due to the time of year but still beautiful. Many shallow areas to swim /splash in. Just kick off your shoes and cool your feet in the water while you enjoy the beautiful scenery. I highly recommend! ', 'This is a sweet waterfall with lots of room to sit and admire the scene!  Very short easy walk but be careful, the rocks with just a little bit of water flowing over them can be slick!  ', 'I was ready to get going and talked a group a friends and family into this short jaunt.  Like others have said the way to the trail isn\'t marked, but that probably what helps keep it looking nice. We got turned around and found a park ranger at the lake who gave me some of the best directions, go over two concrete bridges, once you go over the second take the first right and follow the road to the end. Those are the directions that got us there! \n\n The trip down wasn\'t bad at all. We were one of the first groups of people, and my cousins 8 and 2 year olds did it quite easily. My brother was a monkey and jumped rocks. Both my brother and grandma decided to climb to the top, which I\'m told required some rock climbing. A friend from work played in the water looking for gold and took pictures. I  took loads of pictures and  just enjoyed the sound and feel of the cool running water.\n\n After a couple of hours, and a large hiking group later, it was time to pack up and head back to the cars, my cousin\'s son  said "" When are we going to come back?!?!"" It was a good trip. One thing to note, try to stay on the original granite ""trail"". We went off trail which resulted in a pretty hard fall on the slick wet rocks - I was bruised on my shins for a week! ', 'Great Falls!! Went on a Saturday, mid April, after a weeks rainy storm. The Falls were beautiful. Not many people there maybe 3-4 families. The Hike was easy. Great hike if you have children. Lots of places to sit, eat lunch, enjoy the waterfalls, the stream, and rapids.  Several places to put your feet in the water and enjoy the breath taking view.', 'This was one of the places that I was fortunate enough to grow up with. My pop use to take us a couple of weekends a month. We have done hiking, camping, four-wheeling, and climbing the falls. When we first used to camp there the site was still a small secret. Over the years the secret certainly grew and it has changed much since I first took in its beauty. ', 'A delightful waterfall!  A short jaunt through a wooded area and then down the rocky hill to the base.  A bit of a drive off 50 to get there, but worth it.  ', ""I decided on this hike at the last minute, not really expecting much. Perhaps it was due to my low expectations, but it turned out to be a very pleasant trip. The drive up Highway 50 to Ice house road was pretty uneventful, but once I got onto ice house road, the directions I downloaded from the internet were a bit confusing. Eventually, I hit a visitor center, and found that I was on the right track.\n\nThe turnoff to the trails is NOT well marked...there is no sign that the falls are even down that road, until about .2 miles when you come to the trail turnoff. The dirt road starts off appearing well grated, but it quickly deteriorates as you get further up the road toward the trailhead. There really isn't a parking lot at the end of the trailhead (It can only hold a few large vehicles) so feel free to find a shady spot to park along the way up the road, because it really isn't going to add much distance to your trip.\n\nThe beginning of the trail head is well marked, and it is a short hike to a granite area where the trail starts to disappear. It isn't very difficult to find the falls, and if you look around and pay attention, you can see where foot traffic is generally headed.\n\nThe falls themselves were amazing. The pictures I saw on the internet before i went, just didn't do the falls justice. There were quite a few people there, and some locals told me that the Falls are currently at spring flow levels, due to recent snow and rainfall. We enjoyed hiking around at the bottom of the falls and exploring some of the swimming holes. It is too dangerous to swim right now...but I can certainly see the potential for when the water levels are lower.\n\nThere is a trail to the left (north) of the falls that goes about 2/3 to the top. There is some rock scrambling involved, but it certainly wasn't as challenging as other falls I have been to....and not enough to deter me from taking my 7 year old with me. We enjoyed the view from the top of the falls.\n\nI did not see much wildlife on this trip, but it was a very short hike, and we were not there at the times that are normally for prime wildlife viewing. I will definitely visit these falls again."", 'Nice, short hike and waterfall is amazing, at least during high runoff season.  Brought the dog who also loved it, water was cold though.  Lots of places to stake out a spot next to the water.  Would definitely do this one again, only with more friends!', 'Tons of water. Super easy hike. ', 'Gotta see this one when the snow melt is high. The waterfall and rapids before it are raging and intense. The trail to get to the base is way easy and short.

Mix of forest setting and open space. Trail well maintained, marked, easy to navigate. Eagle Rock was awesome! Great run back to start off trailhead.', 'Diverse scenery. The eagle rock does not disappoint.', 'This hike, while better in the spring, is always a favorite of mine when I’m visiting family in So Cal and have half a day for the drive and the hike.', 'Great transitional trail from oak woodlands to chaparral. There are some exceptionally old oak which do not fail to impress. Highly recommend this trail when there’s some inclement weather, or just post weather.', 'I loved this hike.  The path is great mix of forest and open areas.  The first part is with good tree cover and you are passing through a forest, parts of it have a enchanted vibe.  Then around mile 2 it opens high bush layout and then changes to open plain with short grass.  I saw plenty of birds, rabbits, and squirrels.  On this day, I only met other hikers on my way back, just starting for the day.  The final prize is awesome.  Eagle rock, as you approach it from afar it does look too interesting, but once you circle around the final turn, you understand!  Loved it!  The hike is little away from things but worth the drive.', 'This was a great hike through varied ecosystems including oak forests, cacti/chaparral, and meadows. We went in early October, and had great weather. Our seven year old son enjoyed the hike as well.There was no traffic noise or airplane noise, just birds and frogs. We saw a coyote and some turkeys, and the hikers we passed spotted a mountain lion. The way out is a gradual uphill climb, making the trip back faster and easier.', 'Fun hike to a very interesting rock formation.  Will do this again in the spring when everything is greener.', ""Beautiful trail! It's a slow inclined to the rock so it is much easier going back. The only thing I wish I knew before going is BRING BUG SPRAY. There were so many flies and bugs getting in our eyes while we were near the trees."", 'Super cute hike!! ', 'perfect early morning hike!', 'I love the trails ', 'Nice little trail. Well maintained and not much incline. Took us about an hour each way (my wife, dog and I) wasn’t too challenging, but very scenic and the destination is definitely worth the trip! Will be doing this trail again next time I’m in town.', ""Incredible trail with beautiful views from desert to forest. Definately worth the trip and bring lots of water! Best to go early before hand. Took between 2 hours to 2.5 hours. Don't use Google maps to get there, use this apps map as Google will bring you to a privet, closed property right beside the rock rather than the trail head. The Trail head is to the right of the fire station about 20 metres. "", ""This is for those of you that have never been here before like me. I got a bit confused where to enter for the start of the trail you have to enter a cattle gate to the right of the fire station by the street.I was hesetent to enter because it looked like private property to me. I did enjoy this hike it's not very hard but it was hot so of course bring a lot of water unless you're a camel. I even got to see a deer and a giant jack rabbit which was cool. I loved the shade in the beginning I bet the open fields are very pretty when it gets all green I will go back in the rain season to see new growth."", 'DO NOT follow the “getting there” directions (do not turn left down chihuahua or go down any dirt road), just keep following the original road all the way down to the fire station, and park at the information center. Trail is on THE SAME SIDE OF THE ROAD as the fire station on the right hand side when facing the building, NOT the side of the road with the info center and PCT sign. Also keep in mind this route approaches the rock formation from behind, so be on the look out for the trail split once you hit 3.2 miles! Be sure to bring plenty of water, direct sun is a killler for 2/3 of the way there/back.', ""Eagle rock itself was super cool!! There isn't much shade cover on this trail, so next time I'd try not to go on a really hot and sunny day. The trail was pretty empty when we went."", ""The eagle stone itself is pretty awesome. The hike is rated moderate but it was pretty easy in 85 degree weather. FYI, there's absolutely no shade starting from the half way point to eagle stone so bring lots of water."", ""Very well-maintained trail, hard to get lost. The first 2/3rd you'll have some shade. The last third is straight exposure through grassland. The approach is behind the rock formation so it doesn't look like anything special. Got warned by a rattlesnake chillen by the rocks, so be cautious. Really easy hike."", 'Fun easy well maintained trail. That starts in shaded oak trees then breaks out into a plains area with a cool rock formation at the end.  Nice scenery only a few people.  Saw pretty good size coyote in the mid of the day', 'A must see up close !', 'Hiked this trail with my dog earlier today and it was great. Trail starts off in a forest section with shade and a stream. You can get a view of some cows along the way as well. Trail then opens up to expansive views throug yt? out a valley that eventually leads to Eagle Rock. Not much shade here. Met some interesting people along the way including a group of guys from Australia do the PCT.  All in all, this trail has everything. Easy trail and well maintained. Will definitely be back!', 'Made this hike earlier today with my 12 YO daughter it was fantastic, ran into many PCT thru hikers and they have helped solidify my daughters love for hiking. Great trail and we even met a couple on horseback, will definitely be back to experience this trail again!', 'I loved this trail. The varying trees, plants, and flowers in each section of the hike were delightful to look at. The cows were cute, the trail was relatively quiet, and Eagle Rock looks just like it’s namesake. I did this hike on a Sunday and at one point had the rock all to myself for around an hour. Highly recommend!', 'Beautiful trail and well maintained, pretty much flat with minimal curve. Round trip took less than 2 hours. I would rate this as easy. Eagle Rock is a must see if you just moved to California. Gorgeous!', 'Delightful short hike, only an hour drive from San Diego.Easy parking, adequate signage. Once above timber line, view is spectacular over the open valley to lake Henshaw  and Palomar mountain.On a warm day the breeze from the SSW will be most welcome once in the plateau and on a cold winter day plan on a warm jacket.', 'Great hike! In love with this area. Outstanding place to park at the welcome center across the fire station! WOW! Take many pictures!', 'Thanks to big bro Marty for turning me on to this gem of a hike!Nice hike, first mile or so follows a seasonal creek and walk through shady oak trees. Next couple of miles is out in the open with expansive views, can see Palomar Observatory, Lake Henshaw out in the distance. Eagle Rock formation is amazing and happy to see no graffiti. An added plus on this trail, it is part of the PCT - hiked this on April 12 and met lots of PCT hikers. They were from everywhere....Denmark, UK, all over US - very interesting chatting with them and hearing their stories. Would not want to do this hike when hot because a lot of the hike is in open area with sun beating down on you! Rate this hike on the easy side rather than moderate. Highly recommend this hike!', 'What a FUUUUN hiiiike!!! I would rate it EASY. Make sure to bring lots of water to hydrate and use sunscreen. ENJOY!!!!', '', 'Stunning views especially in the spring with all the wild flowers. Cows along the trail! Saw a rattlesnake also. Various terrains with shade and a nice strong breeze.', 'Great trail! Small creek with shade for the first part, then be ready for the sun! Full sun to the rock formation bring water! We did this with an 8yr boy and 3yr girl in a off road stroller. Trail is rated Moderate but I rate it as a mix of moderate and easy. I am a 37yr female 40lbs overweight. The shaded parts of this trail remind me of a scene in Winnie the Pooh. Many breathtaking views. Park across the street from Warner Springs Fire Station #52 trail starts at the cattle gate located to the right of the fire station. Trail is well marked til about half way is a bare marker with arrows etched into it Follow The Arrows! I recommend this trail just bring enough water.', 'Great well maintained trail. Did this hike on Saturday and it truly is an amazing hike..don’t let the word moderate scare you away it is fairly easy hike with only a few uphill challenges!', 'Did this trail today, a beautiful clear Sunday.  What an awesome hike!  Arrived around 11am and there were about 20-30 cars already parked along the sides of the road.  It definitely wasn\'t crowded though.  We\'ve been wanting to hike on the PCT ""someday"" and this is a great hike to accomplish that on.  Well marked & maintained trail.  Beautiful scenery that changes from a tree-canopied creekside path for the first mile and half or so, to rolling grass fields until you arrive at Eagle Rock.  On the hike back we saw a couple groups of people on horseback.  It seemed to go much quicker on the way back.  Roughly 3hrs round trip including about 20min taking pix at Eagle Rock. We stopped at Lake Henshaw (like 10min away on the road back) to eat and it hit the spot! Great service and generous portions. Definitely recommended!', 'Great hike today out to Eagle Rock. It was cool and drizzly, especially in the open areas. Directions on this app were spot on. Took about 2.5 hours at a leisurely pace. Beautiful changes in scenery and topography. Pretty easy hike.', 'great hike relatively flat great scenery', ""Great hike on the easy side of moderate.  Great scenery along the whole route and the rock is a perfect backdrop for memorable pictures.  Great for kids.\nOnly word of caution above the usual for SOCAL (heat, plenty of water, snakes) is watch climbing on the granite.  It's a very effective skin remover"", 'This was a great hike and was pretty easy overall. I think the key is to go when it is cool out. Had it been summer this would have been a very painful hike. Lots of landscapes and ending at eagle rock is awesome!', 'Definitely go right towards the fire station to get to the trail. Just FYI...It’s a really flat and forgiving route with a lot of nice scenery. My buddies and I had a good time. Y’all should check it out!', 'Loved it!! But I would say it’s an easy hike rather than moderate.', 'Had an awesome time on this trail today- took us about 3 hours there and back... we stopped a few times for pictures and had a snack at Eagle Rock. Most beautiful in the morning hours!', ""Ratings are wrong this trail is not moderate It's fairly easy with superb views of the landscape."", 'Nice hike with large trees providing shade for most of the hike. Easy to follow trail marked with PCT signs. We parked across the street from the fire station and crossed the road to walk through the cattle gate. The hike was about 6.3 miles round trip and ~900 ft in elevation gain. The Eagle Rock formation was really cool. I would definitely recommend the trip! You can even get some Julian Pie on the way home:)', 'Cool PCT hike. Rock formation is awesome', 'Went dogless as I was unsure of wildlife and temps; saw birds, squirrels, and cows. All dogs we saw were leashed. I will definitely be back with my dogs!', ""Drove up to Warner Springs to do this hike. We've always wanted to see this place in person and it did not disappoint. Moderate hike and easy to follow."", 'Beautiful hike, some of the best landscapes of San Diego. Park on the side of the road across the street from the fire station, enter trail thru cattle gate on right side of fire station. Pretty accurate ~6.3mile round trip hike. Little less than 900ft elevation gain per my gps. Would love to go here again when I have more time, it is a bit of a drive but worth it. It’s so quiet out there and we loved that there were only a few others on the trail when we were. Took us just under 2.5hrs at a steady 20/Min mike pace + stopping at the rock for a few minutes. Seeing the rock formation, there’s nothing else like it. Perfect weather on January 1, probably 70 degrees, a little on the dry side.', 'What an awesome way to start 2018! My 4yo and dachshund both had fun and there were no complaints from either :). A nice, easy well taken care of trail.', 'Fun hike (first time). Started at 3pm on Christmas Day (2017), caught a nice sunset from the Eagle. We were in the dark with headlamps the last 1/4 of the way back, but saw a big Jackrabbit and 2 deer at sundown. Saw a few more in the dark with our lamps. Passed 3 groups of hikers total. just over 2 hour hike with some goofing off. Nice scenery...Some trees, then brush, then fields.', 'Gorgeous Christmas hike. Warm, but not hot. only a few people on the trail. Was told there was a big crowd of people at Eagle Rock, but I got lucky and they all left just before I arrived. Ended up with the place to myself. Yippee!!!', 'Great day hike! Easy trail to follow, great parking at the community center.', ""The journey to the eagle is pretty straight forward and I agree that the scenery doesn't change dramatically - though its still a good easy/mild hike.\n\nTRAIL HEAD:\nso this was really confusing as there were 2 entrances on either side of the road.  the CORRECT trail head is to the right of the fire station, not the one that has the PCT signpost.  I apologize to the 3 ladies I gave wrong directions to.  Oops.  :(\n\nAnyway, at the correct trail head, you'll pass through a pipe gate with a sign that say to close it behind you as livestock roam freely in the area.  you'll pass through three of these gates and you should make sure you close the gates or else you'll be on television chasing around wild livestock.  \n\nThe hike itself is very easy - barely any inclines or declines, HOWEVER, towards the later portion of the trail, there wont be any shade so depending on when you go, be cautious and bring enough water and wear your sunblock.  I started the hike at 8AM and the temperature was a crisp 50 degrees F.  But it felt like 70 degrees in the open area.\n\nOnce you reach the EAGLE, go ahead and mount it and fly over the remainder of the PCT.  HA!  Just kidding but wouldn't that be pretty cool?  I named the eagle Daenarys after Daenarys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons."", 'Shorter hike than expected, and we found good weather aside from the Santa Ana winds this week. Really cool eagle rock, but not very many good views along the way. Try and explore more along PCT if you go!', '', 'Beautiful views! Enter the PCT across the road from the parking area and go through pipe gate (there will be three gates total). Lovely hike through open oak woodland habitat out to the plains and rolling hills. Super windy and exposed so bring lots of water.', 'The ‘incline’ at the beginning wasn’t really obvious — very gradual climb with lots of shade and pretty fall colors throughout. When you reach the open field just before the Eagle, expect no shade. Quite blistering even at 78 degrees. The rock is quite the sight and it was super fun to climb on top of for a photo op. Glorious hike with a brilliant change of landscape throughout.', ""Fun hike but I wouldn't drive 2 hours there to do again. Shade in the beginning hotter than hell once you hit the open field closer to the Eagle. Cool to see in person & climbing it was fun for a photo op. Came in about 6 1/4 miles round trip on my Apple Watch."", ""Took my pupper out here today.  challenging but not brutal.  inclines are pretty gentle and the steep parts don't last too long.  the rock is a gorgeous place to take pictures of and from.  the last half mile or so before the rock offers zero shade."", 'Easy hike and beautiful view. so worth it', 'Great trail. Awesome rock formation.', 'Awesome trail and hike', ""Loved this trail. Fairly flat with a little gentle incline, very pretty trail in my opinion. We parked across the street from the fire station and entered onto the PCT to the right of the station. You'll go thru 3 gates along the way. Follow the PCT trail markers for about 3.25 miles and you will see the giant rock formations on your left. The rock is pretty neat. Mother Nature does some amazing things, lol. Not too many bugs, saw lots of squirrels and one coyote, some shade, total length roundtrip 6.5 according to my Fitbit tracker. Enjoy!"", 'Went on this hike yesterday and it was wonderful! The trail is well maintained and no trash at all on the floor or in the bushes. We saw a lot of cows grazing and even came across a few cows that were on the trail with us! We only saw a few other hikers on the trail so that was a plus! Took plenty of pictures once we got to eagle rock. This was a great hike  for all skill levels.', 'This is the most amazing rock formation!  Took a ton of pictures “riding” the eagle. It’s a great, open hike.', 'Great hike on the PCT to Eagle Rock (ER). GPS recorded 7.01 RT miles and 1,196 ft. elevation gains! The first couple of miles on the trail had abundance of poison oak before trekking on the open range Mesa! The Santa Ana winds were prevalent at ER! The views leading up to ER and on ER were breathtaking!', 'Crazy', 'A bit out of the way but the trail was very beautiful and the eagle rock made it worth it!', 'beautiful views, very few people, and the eagle rock itself was worth the hike. would go again!', ""This was a really great trail. My two kids (boys aged 10 and 7 who hike often) completed it just fine. I would go on a cooler day if you plan on bringing the kids. Once the trail opens up halfway to the rock formation there isn't much shade at all. Starts off in a wooded, shady section by a little creek. Ends up in pastures and fields. Then you head back the way you came. Very easy trail to follow as well. Not too many turn offs and very well traveled. We went on Mother's Day and we passed by some people but I wouldn't say it was busy at all. Bathrooms are available at the resource center across the street from the start point. It's a camping area for the PCT hikers. Be sure to stop inside and donate if you can. The volunteers working there were so kind! They even sell eagle rock tshirts and bandanas in there to support the area for the trail."", 'This was a pleasant moderate length hike. Check weather before heading out due to heat concerns. Nice little stream flowing much of the way. Our dog cooled off by laying in it.', ""I love this hike! It had a great variety of scenery and active wildlife. Lots of birds! I'll be hiking this again very soon!"", 'Great hike! Not too difficult. The weather was just right. It started to rain right when we ended the hike.', ""Great hike but must head out early to beat the heat especially with dogs. Bring extra water for them stopping to rest and drink along the way. Right now there are lots of foxtails and ticks so be sure to check them over when you get back. We left at 7:30a and we're back by 10:30a just before the heat got bad. And of course watch for rattlesnakes. Can't beat the photos on an early morning sunny day!"", 'Just go super early to avoid the heat! Bring lots of water!', 'An easy hike along the PCT and dog friendly.', ""April was the perfect time to explore this trail.  Make sure you say hi to the PCT hikers and ask where they are from.  They like to chat. Bring lots of water.  No bathroom at trailhead, but .4 miles up the road (at the Community Center) they allow the PCT hikers to camp and you can use the restrooms.  If you are geocaching, watch out for snakes among the rocks.  We came across a big one.  We were a little worried about the 85 degree forecast and the Santa Ana wind but the strong breeze felt refreshing and made Eagle Rock not so hot.  The first 2 miles are in shade, the last mile is out in the open.  Great views, you can see the Observatory on Palomar Mountain along the way.  Eagle Rock is very interesting.  One of the better rock croppings I've encountered.  Overall this hike gets a 5 thumbs up from me."", ""Fairly easy hike, steady with not a lot of incline. Walking alongside the vast open meadow is so beautiful and unlike what I'm used to. Flowers are blooming and the eagle rock is pretty awesome."", 'Nice little walk through the meadow, pretty flat overall.', 'Great, dog friendly Trail with many different views. Start off on the PCT by going through the forest alongside a stream. About two miles or so in it opens up to open prairies- we were lucky enough to be here during the super bloom so saw many different types of flowers. The rock at the end is a spectacular eagle. We enjoyed a small picnic lunch. Very lightly trafficked which makes it perfect for a dog. We did see two rattlesnakes so be aware of your surroundings and keep your dog close at all times!', ""Very nice hike, not difficult at all. I took my chihuahua/terrier mix, and he's worn out now! The trail is beautiful, and I found it very relaxing!"", 'muy bonita experiencia', 'Amazing and easy hike :)', 'Beautiful day.  Great hike.', 'Great trail to walk at magic hour.  Not too many humans and a wonderful trail to take the dogs on.', 'I brought my 1 year old in a kids hiking backpack, my 4 year old and my 17 year old. Once out of the safety of the trees and reaching the peak the wind picked up and it was a rough time until eagle rock. It was so cold once we made it to the rock it was everything we could do get back to the car ASAP. When we got back into the safety of the trees all was right in the world. This is a good hike in the right weather conditions. It was too long of a hike for the 1 and 4 year old. When the boys get older this is a must do repeat.', ""Park across the street from the fire station right off hwy 79 and walk across the street to the cattle gate to begin the trek. Starts off a little slow in a forested area, but turns into one of the most beautiful areas I've seen in SoCal. 75% of the 6.3 mile out and back has an incredible view. Hiked this December, so it was chilly, but a beenie and fleece should work fine. It's a good hike to get away from it all. There was only one other group on the trail, probably because it was off season for PCT trekkers.  I will be coming back, and I can't say that about a lot of hikes in SoCal."", ""Great hike! I would say this is a fairly easy hike with a few spots that maybe a little challenging for the less experienced hiker, but nothing frequent stops won't get you through. Trail is nicely marked and well maintained. Nice variety of scenery."", 'Nice climb under the shade of oak trees then it clears and you are under the mercy of the weather.', 'Nice hike.  A change from some of the more grueling climbs.  Flat for the most part with some undulations. Trees at first then chaparral then meadows. Saw a coyote that was pretty easy to scare away.  Hour and a half one way.  I think more like 3 miles one way. Once at Eagle Rock it was just amazing to see this natural rock formation that really looks like an eagle. Ate a cliff bar and a handful of trail mix. One liter of water. You can see Palomar Hale observatory at 280 degrees from eagle rock.', ""This is a good trail if you want to do some flat out hiking through moderate terrain and don't want to make a climb out of it. You start out among oaks along a stream, which was dry when I went there, and emerge in open meadows with varied scrub vegetation. Some people see cattle, I was fortunate to see a deer as well. The rock formation was amazing and I could not figure out if it had weathered that way or got some help from certain wannabe sculptors. Geocachers will be delighted to find a lot of hides on this hike. I found 12 of them.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/QN-hgzlH5FA"", 'A great trail to run with no obstructions or hazards, and a decent amount of inclines to get a good workout in.', 'Great hike, hot day.. A fun out and backer', 'Went early morning about 8 to beat the heat.   An hour out and and an hour back. Nice trail shaded the first half full sun back half. Eagle Rock impressive would go again.', ""Beautiful trail with tons of wildlife. Not a lot of elevation so it's not terribly difficult. Well marked. Hot as heck, though, so bring tons of water and maybe think about going when its not 90 degrees."", 'Great trail with spectacular views and wildlife.  Good workout and had beautiful weather for the hike.', 'Excelente; beautiful day; nice -moderate hike ;I recommend it!', 'Great hike a lot of pct challengers heading north while your going se but great trek', 'Great hike!!! Love it!', 'Easy hike. Scenery changes often, lots beautiful area.', ""Great trail! I found this trail to be easy to moderate. There was some elevation game, and out and back we logged 6.8 miles. There is a lot of shade in the beginning with beautiful trees and a stream flowing alongside the trail. Out by the eagle rock, it's more open with no shade, though. Beautiful sites, east to find, and a great workout!"", 'Great hike! Not difficult. It was 7 miles to Eagle Rock and back for us. My 5 year old did it with no problem. Bring plenty of water. The scenery is just plain beautiful!', 'A must hike in SOCAL.  Make sure you bring plenty of water.', 'Very enjoyable trail', 'Absolutely loved everything about this walk. A very gentle uphill which was manageable even for my 13 year old chihuahua. Woods and Meadows! The cows were a huge surprise especially when they came running at us! But they were friendly, just interested in my dog. They followed us for about a half mile about 10 steps from us! I would do this hike again tomorrow!', 'Easy', ""This 6.5 out-and back trail is well maintained, clearly marked. About every mile or so the landscape seems to change, from lush riparian to desert to open plains, it's a really lovely hike with very little elevation gain. Beware the cow patties."", ""So much fun!!  Pretty views with both sunny and shady spots along the way.   The rock is really cool.  It's a long 6 miles but well worth it!"", 'Very nice rock formation at the end of our long hike. We actually came from Mount laguna via the PCT across the San felipes.', 'Great hike. Not difficult. Good workout. Bring plenty of water.   Like others, it is more like 6.5 miles. Starts in the woods and eventually comes to the prairie. Lots of cows, windy, and the rock is right off the PCT.   I went to the wrong rock formation thinking it was left and a way from the path.\n\nPark across from the fire station in Warner Springs, walk across the road to the gate, open and your in. If you like to golf, combine it with a round at Warner Springs golf club about a mile up the road. Cant go wrong on a day trip.', 'It is 6.6 miles to the Eagle Rock statue and back. Great trail for kids. Follow the PCT crossing over one dirt trail stay straight on PCT. Will come to open land with minimal vegetation and you will see rocks off to left. Take side dirt trail around to back of Rock formation and you will see the Eagle.', 'Really beautiful on a hot fall day. There was shade from the riparian vegetation for much of the hike, and it was not difficult. Saw a coyote run across the path, lots of beautiful birds, and many cows roamed nearby. Eagle Rock is stunning! Almost looks like it was created by a sculptor. The view from the rock is gorgeous.', ""nice trail.  We wanted to go to barrel springs but didn't realize it was as far as it was.  Unfortunately we didn't take enough water.  And to be honest couldn't find the the town.  We ended up out 8 miles to S22.  Oh well next time.  We went labor day weekend and it was pretty hot.  I can see why it's best to go LATE fall through spring.  We should have known when we didn't see any wild life :)  Eagle rock was a nice jaunt.  Well defined clean trail."", 'Love this trail from Warner Springs on the 79. Quick hike to eagle rock. Spotted coyotes in long distance...scary as I was solo. Once you hit prairie, it is gorgeous. Hope to return and head opposite direction.', ""Did this hike with my min-pin on a Wednesday afternoon and he loved it. Plan around 3hrs and an 8 mile round trip to Eagle Rock and back. We parked next to the fire station in a small chain-linked fenced area right next to the road. Weather was mostly cloudy and a bit chilly but I did just fine with shorts and a wind breaker type jacket. We started around 4pm and still got back before it was dark. Overall nice hike, pretty straight forward with some really nice views. Head east next to the fire station through the metal gate and stay on the main path. There will be a couple of black and white signs posted next to Eagle Rock letting you know you've arrived. Took us about 2 hrs to get there, not being in a hurry and stopping several times to take pics. Took us only 1hr to get back probably since it's mostly downhill and we were hungry! You may encounter some PCTers along the way too either camped out or trekking from the opposite direction, just a heads up."", 'Great trail out to Eagle Rock. Not strenuous. Gets windy once you are out in the open field.', 'This hike was pretty easy but so worth it once you are on the trail you will see tons of cows and beautiful blue brids. We parked in the fire station FYI leave them a note on your windshield if you head out before sunrise, so they know who and where you are. Once you get to eagle rock its awesome.  ', ""Great hike.  My son's first hike with his new pack.  He had a blast.    We went all the way to Barrel Springs spent the night.  Walked out the next day.  Started in Warner Springs at 1100 got to Barrel Springs at 1700.  Eagle rock is way cool.  Good source of water just south of eagle rock at two cattle troughs.  There were two more cattle troughs  at about the 6.5 mile mark but were about one mile off the trail.  Plenty of water at Barrel Springs.  All the water needed to be purified.  Excellent hike.  Great back country camp sights.  My 7 month old Boxer loved it."", 'Hiked out to Eagle Rock yesterday. All the autumn colors made this a very enjoyable hike. The first mile or so, surrounded by bright yellows, reds, purples, and greens hiking the woodland area. Then next, a high desert with its own chaparral color pallet, breathtaking! I recommend this hike in the Fall. It is an easy hike out to Eagle Rock, good for all levels.', 'Easy hike on part of the PCT.  Under cover for a portion of the hike then open space.  Not much elevation gain the the Eagle formation is very cool!!', ""Left from the fire station in Warner Springs today.  It's a nice ride on horseback, probably would be a great hike.  We got to see a few cows!  The horses really enjoyed eating algae in the water trough too, so that was a hoot.  The rock is great and there's some shade in the riverbed, which is great on a hot day like today was."", 'This as a wonderful hike and well worth the long drive out from San Diego. ', 'Great hike through trees, shrub, and prairie. Easy to moderate, along flowing stream. Great views.\n', 'Just finished the hike with my 10 yr old. The trail is very clear and has plenty of markers to help you along the way. The rock is incredible. My son who loves eagles likes this tral the best.

Otherwise, it was a great workout and provided a fantastic view!', 'great views from the top i  only came back once but been thete serval times taking different longer rounts', 'this Trail is pretty much all uphill with a few breaks and not any switchbacks and is out and back ...completed this hike not very many stops in about 3. my recommendation is to bring good traction shoes with trekking poles especially going back down if you reach the top of Castle Peak. A lot of loose Rock. I would definitely go again but with someone who was more adventurous and would be willing to stop to take some pictures. stunning views but be ready for sudden changes in weather especially going in October/ November', 'got this one knocked out right as it started to snow on November 21. I wish I had known that you are able to drive in the first 1.5 or so miles past the gate. Also checked out Andesite Peak on the way back.', '2nd time around..get up there to see a fire at around donner lake or hwy 89 yesterday..makes u realize hikers vulnerabilities..great views and great scramble up once you get up past first turret..not a trekking pole hiker but they may come into play on way down..', 'Quite windy today, but beautiful skies and miles and miles of visibility. Trail is in good condition, although a bit loose going up the last 3/4 mile (all walkable if careful)', ""This hike has great views. It's pretty moderate until the last mile, then it's steep. Bring poles, it can be pretty slippery. Lots of loose gravel and sand."", ""I've done this as a snowshoe day hike in the winter, an overnight backpacking with snowshoes in the winter, and a spring/summer hike. All times have been great with different experiences! One of my favorite go-to's when I need a quick hike that I'm familiar with and won't get lost."", 'Fun little hike before the snows return. If actually trying to bag the true summit keep in mind it’s the easternmost crag. Def a bit of exposed class 3 climbing to get up top but we still managed to get up in a little under two hours.', 'Great hike with amazing views! Going down was a little tough/slippery... bring gloves!', 'I have done castle Peak at least 5 times. I have completely circled it and spent a night at Warren lake. I have also done Andesite and Basin Peaks.This is an amazing area. It is loose and steep up the final ridge. Bring poles. Also you can park closer if you have a high clearance vehicle.

Poles would've been a smart idea since it is rocky and slippery in spots. Beautiful views ❤️"", 'absolutely beautiful', 'Lower section is open to high clearance vehicles in summer.  Suggest taking Pacific Crest Trail to the junction near Castle Ridge.  Also note short extension on PCT to Peter Grubb Hut at Round Meadow.', 'THE TRAIL STOPS AT THE TOP!  My friend and I reached the top from the South and spread out looking for a pass.  We found nothing but steep rocky drops and cliffs.  We picked it up a notch by making our own trail down to the valley and summited again from the North side.\n\nIt was a great hike with great views.  But note that this map is not correct.', 'I love scrambles and steep hikes but the trail was so slippery it wasn’t fun. Constantly trying not to fall. The views were pretty good but there are certainly much better hikes in the area', 'It was gorgeous and well worth it. We never found one trail sign though and asked other hikers along the way. There are several other trails to other destinations so it is too bad it has no signage.  The only one we saw was the PCT marker.', 'Great hike 8/23/18.  Two 60+ year old women did the hike no problem.  Not as rocky or slippery despite my fears after reading some of the reviews.  That being said, I left my dogs (2 Border Collies) at home.  Would not recommend bringing a dog.  Hard on their feet and they could literally fall off a cliff if you’re going to the very tippy top.  Plus it’s very sun exposed.  Made it all the way up to the top Castle Peak and then continued on the the ridge over to Basin Peak and back down on the PCT past Peter Grub Hut (very interesting).  Total miles probably close to 9.5.  Unfortunately my phone died toward the end of recording the hike.  Would do this again.  Incredible views.', 'There is no trail at top where there is a lot of exposure. We turned back and did not do the loop. It is a much longer hike that way.', 'Great hike with amazing views. Things to know: Take bug spray. You’ll be happy to have it in the first mile or so, before you get into fast elevation grades. Obviously, you needwater, glasses, and suntan lotion. I don’t like poles, but I’d think most people do.The hike is 3.0-3.1 miles to the top. After the first 1.5 miles it gets much steeper with incline grades of 30-60 percent. Those don’t relent for almost the entire way to the top. At the top you have to do some very minor rock climbing to get to the top. Amazing views and feeling of accomplishment.For those who are in very good shape it’s probably  not that big of a deal. For the weekend warrior it’s a great workout but it’s not going to be easy, but you can do it!Also, anyone who takes a 4 year old on this trail is irresponsible in my opinion. It’s way too steep to think taking a small child on the last mileof this trial is a good idea.', 'Amazing hike!  Starts off fairly mundane...but then steps it up and is very challenging but worth the pay off at the end!', 'Beautiful, challenging trail. Dangerous in one part. I recommend starting this like Frog Lake Overlook Trail. Ie — Pick up the PCT at the campground on the south side of hwy 80 at the castle peak exit (bunny hill drive).  Follow this under the 80 and pick up the summit lake trail. This first section is VERY picturesque — a nice start to the hike. And the entire hike to Frog Lake overlook is superb. God trail, good coverage, great views. Frog lake overlook is quite breathtaking.  Then you traverse to Castle Peak. Pretty easy even though the trail is NOT moderately trafficked. Hard to follow in many places — but the ridge-line is there as a guide and the terrain is easy going. BUT THEN you hit the big rocky step that goes up to castle peak where the three towers are — and the trail disappeared for me. This area is DANGEROUS from my POV.  The rock is very steep and crumbly. There are numerous areas that might be the trail — many lead to sketchy or exposed (small) climbs — and some of these just dead-end causing back tracks.  I was “on” the GPS trail — but it wasn’t there. Just scary cliffs, climbs and dead-ends. I eventually scrambled off “trail” down about 100 feet and around some of the worst parts — and then hunted and pecked my way back up to the plateau.  From there smooth sailing.  The easternmost tower is climbable from the east face (exposed class 4 climb about 50 feet). Middle tower is easy to climb right up the center.  All views are impressive. Tops of the towers very exhilarating. The walk down is pretty — but very little cover and  loose footing at places from heavy traffic.  To extend the hike a bit, link up with “hole in the ground” trail before joining the last part of the Castle Peak return. Then walk down and under hwy 80 in the road and follow bunny hill drive to the campground.', 'Easy trail to the base of the mountain, but a bit of a scramble to the summit. Worth it for the views', 'Fun and challenging hike!  The trailhead is located right off of I-80.  Plenty of street parking.  I would recommend trekking poles as the downhill descent is steep with loose rocks.  Lots of interesting rock formations with spectacular views. Dog friendly!', 'This was a super fun and easy trail! We went early in the morning and it was very chilly at the top, so definitely prepare for that.  At the top, you can see two ridge lines; make sure you descent to the correct ridge line it’s easy to get them mixed up! There was a little bit of snow but it was mostly melted. There was a nice view at the top and there were lots of cool rocks and things to see all the way up.  I definitely would recommend this hike! It’s a great trail for if you don’t want to drive all the way to Tahoe but want to do some good hiking!', 'one of my favorites', 'Hiked 6/20/18 with my 9 & 4 year old. At the bottom mosquitos were out, but disappeared after leaving the road and starting on the trail. Wish I had brought bug spray though. Poles would definitely have helped toward the top! Windy at summit but great views. Took us 4 hours with the kids but without them could have been much faster!', 'once on top of castle peak there is no trail that I could find.  I had my phone GPS and Garmin Fenix GPS and while they indicated I was ""on the trail"" there were several points where the ""the trail"" was a cliff!   there was a lot of snow on the backside of the peak so its possible the trail was on the backside buried but I couldn\'t find it and had a harrowing experience backtracking.', 'Beautiful hike. There is a little bit of snow left and the wildflowers are still in bloom as you aapproach the summit. Poles may be helpful as you get to the top due to the loose gravel. Super windy at the top of the peak in the mornings; however, the views are amazing!', 'Climbed on 6/9/18. Trail has decent amount of water running down from the last bit of snow melt. At the second parking area ~1mi in, there’s packed snow on the trail for 1/3-1/2 mi. Pretty much clear to the summit after that.', '6/16/18 Got to the trailhead around 8 and there were only a few other cars on a Saturday morning. More by the time we left but not crowded. Still patches of snow on the ground in some parts but nothing major. About 3 hours round trip with a stop at the summit to make coffee and eat a snack. Beautiful hike.', 'Great hike!  Still a good bit of snow in some parts.  Make sure your boots are water proof and prepare your quads for a good work out on the last mile of the ascent to the peak.', 'Yessssum ammoooozing hike yezzz', 'classic Donner hike with a couple challenges, some steap ones though. amazing view from the East tower which is the true summit and maintains the hardware to prove it. pretty busy hike on the weekends is the only downside.', ""App keeps closing on me, the activity is snowshoeing, I went in shoes that vented and my socks were wet. There is still a lot of snow up there. There are trails on the snow made by snow motor vehicle that you can't really miss. It's really peaceful and beautiful up on the peak where you can see mountain ranges in 360°. It was cloudy so it for chilly for me. Would definitely go again when the snow melts!"", 'Hiked up the peak yesterday. The snow was well packed, needed snowshoes only on our way back. Great hike and wonderful views!', '', 'Had a great sunny day today. Snowshoes the entire trip.  I will be doing this again.', 'Super fun in snow! Went snow shoeing with my best friend today, and it was a beautiful view up at the top! Not too difficult, the steepness is pretty gradual until the end. Would love to see it in the springtime.', 'Amazing hike. Pack warm, waterproof hiking shoes and trekking poles', 'Do this hike in the summer then come back and do it in the winter, it’s so amazing to see the change in the terrain. Such an amazing hike I recommend it to everyone', 'Convienient and amazing!!', 'Castle peak cut short to one of the false summits. 1-2ft snow up past the pass. Skis/snowshoes needed after about 1.5 miles in.', 'Lots or snow and pretty tough incline to the summit. But great views!', 'Breathtaking in both senses. Very well worth the time and energy. I may have taken a hundred photos along this trail. Although I approached Castle Pass from the rest area.', 'Great workout and amazing views but a bit slippery.', 'Wonderful hike with views 360 degrees Terrain was rocky and scree in places was slippery but worth the effort', 'Wonderful trail, please stay on he trail. Be sure to make for an earily accent to avoid possible afternoon weather, able to get to summit, it is the last turret!', 'Amazing views and a great workout.', 'Incredible panoramic view from the summit.  Well worth the journey which is almost entirely uphill.  The trail is clearly visible and easy to navigate.  Scaling the outcroppings at the summit should be done only with great caution and experience.', 'Great hike but steep in places.  Bring trekking poles.', 'Mostly dirt trail with a gradual incline that leads to steep incline towards the top where trail turns to shale, gravel and large rocky steps. Bring poles or grab a walking stick. Area is exposed to sun and wind, bring layers and sunscreen. Nice hike with gorgeous views.', ""This hike is definitely for experienced hikers. I'd recommend going when it's about 50-60 degrees because most of the trail is in the sun. We ended up hiking about 2.5 miles more than the actual hike because we parked before the beginning of the actual trailhead. Oh well! If you have hiking sticks (especially anyone with knee or ankle issues), I'd recommend them, but my husband and I did the hike without them."", 'Great cool day for this hike... loved the entire thing. you pop out off the trees pretty fast and follow the knife edge up for some great scrambles and even better views. If you are in the Truckee area I say pop out and knock this one out. Keep a solid pace to get up there in a little over an hour so you can spend your time scrambling from turret to turret of the this unique castle and take in the views.', ""Loose gravel, a lot of sun exposure. At the peak there's a lot of rocks to scale and a great 360 view."", 'fun hike.  you can make a loop of it, sort of...', 'I started at the trail head. Instead of going to Castle Peak I walked another five miles on the Pacific Crest Trail. Beautiful!', 'Easy access to the high country.  Difficult due to elevation at the top plus loose gravel.   Poles are definitely helpful. Beautiful fields of wildflowers and amazing view at the top', ""It's an amazing hike, but bring your sunscreen, most of it is in the full sun."", 'Good hard trail after you get to the saddle. There is still some snow on lower level prior to saddle. Great views from the top!', 'Amazing scenery along the trail, the prize is at the top with spectacular views. There was a good amount of snow still on the ground mid-July. Would recommend water proof shoes/ good tread/ ankle support and two walking sticks. You will use them on the incline and decent, which is very challenging due to loose rocks, dirt and steep terrain. Expect several slips coming down, it’s steep. As you get closer to the top, the climb becomes more difficult depending on your age, stamina, and whether altitude affects you. We saw several persons over the age of 60 and they did it. We also saw a group of kids (10-14 yrs.) from a nearby camp heading to the top. My group found the hike to be “hard” during the last part, mostly due to the altitude and steep incline. Took us 4 hours to get up with many photo stops along the way, an hour at the top for lunch and 2 hours to get down. We were taking our time. Lots of bugs/mosquitos at the beginning of the trail, recommend bug spray. Lots of standing water due to snow melt near the entrance. In our opinion, it was a very challenging hike but worth the sore feet, scrapes and bites. The views are stunning. FYI- we observed fresh bear tracks in the snow mid way up.', 'Still some snow on the first part of the trail...otherwise was a fun and amazing hike to the top.', ""As others have mentioned snow is still on the PCT part of the trail which is not that strenuous. However this shouldn't cause any issue with staying on the path. The snow gets slick as it melts so between that and the loose ground/rocks closer to the peak boots would be recommended. Poles will make the decent from the peak much easier as well. The 360 views from the top make it all worth while."", '07/09/17 Started mid day, round trip took 3 hours including a lunch break at the summit. The hike to the pass is moderate. Still some snow on the ground but the trail is easy to follow. Recommend wearing waterproof shoes. The elevation gain from the pass to the peak is strenuous. The views at the top are great. All around a great day hike.', 'Nice hike. Great views from the top. Still some snow along andesite ridge but clear once you break off from the PCT. Snow melt along the trail would provide filterable water source.', 'Snow at lower levels among the trees.  Once on the ridge dry.  Loads of people on the trail today - July 3rd.', 'Fantastic hike and breathtaking views. Still a lot of snow in July!', 'I just did this hike in the deep snow. I was almost completely unprepared for it and it was great! Everyone I passed had skies or snowshoes and hiking poles, but I just had my leather boots and some determination. It took me 2 and a 1/2 hours to get up and only 45 minutes to come down. I loved every minute of it. It was all worth it when I got to the ridge.', 'The trail is all covered with snow. It is difficult to go to the top the last 200 yards. It can be icy too.. it took us a longer time to hike this trail because of snow.', ""We didn't make it all the way to Castle Peak as we made it about two miles out and then headed back. Lots of fun, great views!"", 'Really enjoyed this hike. Easy going at the beginning and gets increasingly difficult. The last push is very steep and rocky. Slipped on the loose rocks on the way down a couple of times. Hiked through packed snow about 1/3 of the time but it was sunny and warm the whole time. It took about two hours getting up, at a leisurely pace, and about half the time down.', ""The hike was not as challenging as I had thought it would be.  It was iced up pretty good and with out shoe chains or crampons it was slick! 35 mph wind on top and 34deg at the bottom. \nI think I'll go back once we have some fresh powder and shoe in when less people are around."", 'Good hike. Only 4 stars because if the long fire road run in. Last part is steep but not as bad as it sounds. The last scramble is a true class 3. Great views and interesting geology.', ""Not too bad until you get to the final haul up the peak, then it's a killer, but the view from the top makes it completely worth it!"", 'Awesome hike', 'It was an awesome hike! One heck of a haul to the top!', 'Constant incline, fun journey, almost perfect view (seeing 80)', ""Nice hike, strenuous but not too difficult. I could see several other peaks I'd like to hike next time"", 'Great hike and work out! Trekking poles definitely help coming down as some of the rock/ dirt is slippery! It does get windy and a bit chilly on the ridge and at the top. Definitely a trail I would do again!', 'Caladros. Stupendous view.', 'This was not good.  Boring.  Better trails in south lake.', 'Awesome view at the top.   Relaxed and ate some lunch and took a little nap...', 'The views at the top are amazing', 'Great my 10year old did it with no problem!', 'Great up n down. Very loose footing along the last mile to the top, hiking poles are highly suggested.', ""Gorgeous panoramas. Challenging hike especially along the top ridge where it's very loose."", 'Awesome.  3 miles out and 3 miles back.  Last mile was best.  Hiked across the ridge line and the cool wind made it a delight.  Dual hiking poles made downhill loose rocks very helpful.', 'A great hike with fantastic view. Be prepared for high winds along the ridge line', 'Great trail.', 'Stunning views on this beautiful hike. Decided to do it instead of Shirley Lake hoping for less crowds and it worked. We parked along the road and walked 1.5mi to the trailhead. Great way to warm up before hitting the steep hiking trail. It gets steep and is rocky, yes. I would have been in trouble with out sticks. Made it to the tippy top. Oh! The wild flowers are giving a spectacular show right now.', ""really nice hike.  moderately busy on the way up.  the hardest part of the ridgeline is pretty slippery so make sure you wear some shoes wth good traction.  there's some great views and the area is very relaxing and quiet!  castle peak is one of my favorites spots so far and what's great is there's many more trails to keep the challenge going.  I also climbed Andesite peak on the way back and that is also extremely slippery.  enjoy the hike!"", 'Very difficult hike in the sense that it is fearful and exciting. I broke my ankle at the very top last summer and had to hike all the way down on my own with broken bones. This hike is very sketchy coming down because it is very loose, gravely, and, steep (but so worth it, beautiful & amazing!!!) so be prepared to take it easy. Depending on where you park your car will greatly depend on your mileage. Enjoy!', 'One of my favs always and forever. Great views of Tahoe. Any time of year is good. A great snow shoe hike.', ""This is actually a very nice trail with great views from the top. You don't really get to the very top unless you bring climbing gear or have very large juevos.( did I spell that right? ). The reason I only gave it 3 stars is that for about 90% of the trail you get to enjoy the background noise of Interstate 80. It's not overly loud, but it's there. A definite drawback if you want solitude, though not a reason to skip this trail."", 'Hiked from the parking area with the dog up Castle Peak then across to Basin Peak and down past Peter Grubb Hut and back. It was very windy as usual, with tiny patches of snow on the North sides of the peaks, but well worth making the trip up before the mountains get their winter coats.', ""Jumped on trail at rest stop east of Boreal. Trail head to the right of building. Ended up walking about 8.5 miles to top of Castle Peak  About first 3.2 miles was variable terrain, mostly shaded. Beautiful wooded forests. Came across 4 trail runners. We decided to stay on trail rather then going down to dirt road that is identified as Castle Peak. Much more quaint trail, less exposed. Last mile or so, up to the peak, is a pretty good incline, very gravelly, rocky. You get to an outlook, thinking it's the peak, to realize you have maybe a quarter of a mike more to climb. It's worth it. Panoramic views. Wear good shoes; walking stick helpful. GPS navigation on Alltrails came in extraordinarily helpful as there are many trails branching off of trail."", 'Great hike. First mile and half you share with mountain bikers, equestrian and maybe a few rogue trucks, second part is straight up hiking and rewards are awesome at the top of the peak.  Strongly recommend good grip hiking boots as lots of skidding on little rocks. Went in August and it was a little smoky obscuring view just very slightly. Plan to definitely return in June for more clarity and see the windflowers.', ""Great day hike!  I was lucky enough to have a vehicle that could take us all of the way to the base of the Andesite Ridge, and we started out from there..\nSeeing parts of the PCT is really fun, but, then the climb up was just breathtaking..there are a few stops along the way with some shade, but, once you climb above the treeline, you'll be exposed to the sun for the rest of the day...there's some neat hidden backpack spots hiding under rocks for protection.  Great 360 views from the very top..well worth the effort."", 'one of our favorite! great for training, lot of climbing to the peak, loose rocks last mile or so. have gone up the ridge and gone the PTC through Round Valley which is more forested. Hv hiked in snow and warmer weather. hike along trail to Peter grub hut, hike up to Andersite peak,endless trail possibilities in such a beautiful area!', 'Great hike, even in March during a dry season.', ""Excellent day hike. Some snow but you could walk on top of it. Wished I'd had a good map to identify more of the visible peaks."", 'Took my teenage girls for this hike and they really enjoyed it. They are looking to go back and bring friends. The view is amazing. Next time I will hike over the basin peak and walk along the ridge back to castle. Very enjoyable.', 'Started the hike around 10:30 am and finished by 12:30. We were hiking quite fast and there is some snow and ice right now but the trail is able to by hiked with just running shoes. There were kids hiking it to but to the North side to the top a lady did slip down the snow about 20 feet so stay focused on where you put your feet. 48 F degrees on this Sunday. Well worth the light haededness and the view on top', 'This trail is a fun hike or snowshoe trek depending on the season.  The trail begins at the entrance to Castle Valley.  The beginning of the trail is marked by the glacial carved granitic outcrops along the way, and after a mile or so the andesitic volcanic deposits replace the granite.  Here, the two predominant rocks of the Tahoe Sierra are present:  granodiorites of what geologists call the subjacent series, and more recent andesitic volcanic deposits of the superjacent series.  The ridge tops here, including the turrets of Castle Peak are the younger volcanics.  From the top of Castle Peak, rainfall on the west slope enters the Yuba  basin where it drains to the Pacific under the Golden Gate Bridge, whereas rainfall on the east slope enters the Truckee River basin, where it flows to the Great Basin in Nevada.', 'Highly recommend doing this trail in the winter with snowshoes.  I did it on a clear calm January day and the views were spectacular!  We even glissaded down parts of the mountain. Super fun!', ' Awesome hike.  Make sure to watch your step as you go up the mountain. The trail is really soft with lots of loose rocks.   It is well worth it when you get to the top it is an amazing view.', 'Great easy to get to hike.  Incredible 360 degree views.  Careful of the east side since it is a bit if a drop but this is one of the easier climbs in the area.  A use trail not far from the summit will take you to basin peak.  Also options to hike in several directions from castle pass.  The road into castle valley is not too bad but you do want a high clearance vehicle.', 'An easy-to-get-to climb for a view of most of the northern Sierras. From the start: everyone seems to park at the end of the pavement on the road there, you can apparently park further on but don\'t try the dirt road without high clearance. There\'s a map at the trailhead showing the area, note that the section of this trail after Castle Pass isn\'t shown on any map, you just turn right at the pass and follow the user trail along the crest of the ridge. The climb is extremely steep rock and gravel with no switchbacks and not much traction. There are at least three ""summits"" here, all pretty close to the same height; the first you can get on top of, the other two are vertical pillars of jagged andesite, and the back side of the mountain is a sheer cliff. Visible northwest is the rather wicked-looking Sierra Butts viewed edge-on, and beyond that is Mount Lassen, 100 miles distant. We could also see the Sutter Butts, west at 80 miles, and hints of the coast range beyond that. A good trail if you just want to climb a mountain for a nice view.', ""This was a beautiful hike. Gorgeous view and very challenging.  There's a great camping spot 100 ft from the peak under the ledge facing the west side of peak. Built in fire fit! Coming down was challenging because of the loose rocks and scree.  It took a little longer so bring trekking poles!  And make sure your shoes have some tractions. Also, saw some beautiful butterflies, and lots a mosquitoes, they got me really good through my pants even! Bug spray is a huge must have! "", 'From the Castle Peak trail head off of hwy 80 at Boreal Ridge Road.  I hiked the fork of the Pacific Crest Trail, which is basically going the opposite way if you look at the map on this site. This trail was so nice!  At just a little over 6 miles out and back I was able to hike to the Lake Angela, Lake Flora, Lake Azalea.  There are short ascents then descents so you get nice heart exercise.  All at about 7200 ft above sea level.  I highly recommend this trail.', ""I hiked this in the Summer several years ago solo, grapped a peak and then got a little crazy and clambered all over the castle peaks and came down on the other side - so it wasn't an out and back for me.  Grabbed some geocaches along the way.\n\nGreat views of Sugar Bowl and out to Tahoe and down towards Round Valley and the Sierra Crest"", 'Ok hiking in the snow is no joke! The elements are far harder then summer/spring hiking. Non the less it was pretty amazing. The view is so pretty. ""Snow Shoes!"" A must and cant stress it enough, even if you have to take them off at certain points and strap them on you pack. I say this because we took a wrong turn, and ended up in knee high snow for over 30 min, and it zapped us of our energy...not cool! Not all places at this time of year had alot of snow, but some places could be like Quick Sand :(  Great hike though.', ""Made to top of castle peak after 3 try's . Once you make it to saddle have lunch then push to top . It not easy snowshoeing to the peak."", 'This is best described as a moderately difficult hike, but clearly worth the effort once you reach the ridge. The only tip I would offer is to carry sunscreen as there was little protection from the sun. Aside from that, expect a great workout and enjoy the views!', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '',

This adds 2 miles to the hike. Right now because of the heavy rain last week the water is really flowing and so beautiful! There are many stream crossings to get to the waterfall so be ready to get your feet and lower legs wet. We hiked with our dogs and children and it was a great time! Very beautiful hike and i highly recommend going soon to see this volume of water.', 'Great waterfall hike!! Easy 1 mile to Falls from camp ground. If u park in upper lot & take trail down it’s an extra 1.5 miles RT. Also lots of shade. Has options to add more miles on upper trailhead. Sunset Ridge can go on for miles...', 'it was fun!!', ""my wife and I did this with our infant and dog. the road was closed so we parked by the nursery at the bottom of the hill and made a nice 5 mile round trip. once you get to the camp site it's only half a mile to a really beautiful little spot. don't forget to be prepared to carry out your trash, there are only trash cans by the camp site!"", 'Great hike overall. Some inclines and downhills but nothing to step and unmanageable. I haven’t hiked in awhile and it was more on the moderate then easy side in that sense but for an avid hiker should be a breeze. Once you get to the streams half a mile before the waterfall it gets pretty shady  but also fun navigating the trail. I’d definitely go back again!', 'Beautiful hike with a lot of shade from trees.  Similar to Eaton Canyon but with a smaller space to hang out at the ending waterfall.  Great for kids!', 'Waterfall looked nice. Not crowded.', 'The gate to the road that leads to the campsite was closed, so I parked right outside of it. I hiked up and started through the Chaney trail. The trail was not packed at all, considering it was a Thursday. The hike was short, nice and easy hike, I would definitely go again!', 'This is by far my favorite hiking trails. Def a hidden gem! It’s hardly ever crowded. It’s a beautiful trail w/ lots of shade. There are crossings so get ready for the possibility of wet shoes. Fairly easy trail. You do need a parking pass. Leads to a waterfall.', 'fun & easy, brought my 5 month old pup and my friend brought her daughter. saw a lot of families with 4+ year old kids, so the hike is generally easy. the stream is very pretty. you do have to cross it a few times to stay on trail. there is a great water flow at the falls at the end right now. so pretty!', 'Fun, easy hike that ends in a beautiful waterfall; not too many people. I parked off the road and hiked down on the trail which was scenic but its a single track trail so watch/listen for bikers. I especially had to be careful because I had my dog on a leash. For some it may be best to park in the lot by the campground. All in all a great way to get in some exercise and enjoy the outdoors.', 'If you park all the way down the hill at the campsite, then walk through the site, the sign from the campsite says that the falls are only 0.5 miles away, making the whole trip from your car and to the falls and back a flat, short, hike of just a little over 1 mile. We went on a Wednesday afternoon and only ran into a few other hikers as well as had the falls to ourselves. I liked how there were pamphlets on the local birds available to take from the info board in the parking lot. We saw the last of the fall color, some squirrels, and beautiful, clear, water since it had rained a week prior. If you’d like a short hike and are okay with crossing some streams, this little hike is very beautiful and time well spent.', 'a lot of people', 'Great easy trail, very populated during weekends.', ""Really nice, small, waterfall for very little effort. The hike up through the creek is great. You weave to either side of the flowing creek. The creek has a nice shallow flow, with crystal clear water. You're in the shade almost the entire time. Would def come back during the summer.\n\nThis hike can probably be accessed from Milliard Camp parking lot a bit further down the road, since the GPX route takes you right through Milliard Camp anyway. This might be better idea for some, as the section between the marked parking area and Milliard Camp is single track and is accessed by a LOT of mountain bikers. We were there early Sat morning and prob had about 20+ bikers passed us."", 'nice little fun trail.', ""Glad to mark this 1 of the list but won't do again, mostly because of the crowds. Too many loud kids, music blasters & ill-prepared walkers. The lower parking lot was open on 11/25/18. From here it's no more than 1.25 miles round trip. From the upper lot & road parking there is a lot of steep road walking that wouldn't be worth the effort."", 'Three stars is because it’s so dusty. You couldn’t access the parking lot because the road was closed due to fire danger. So I parked along the side of the road walked up the hill a bit and found a place to enter. Once he and I had a Tonna fun and it wasn’t crowded at all then again it’s a Wednesday morning. Straight up I went and the rundown was very easy. If you got an hour and a half to kill go knock it out.', 'The waterfall (in November) was pretty small but the hike was nice, not a ton of people, and easy to get to, would recommend', 'Fun and easy hike and the fall was beautiful.  The parking lot was closed because of fire season. The incline from the parking area was the hardest part and added a mile to the hike. When the parking lot is open I would recommend for children.', 'really super for kids and dogs.  wonderful hike', 'lots of logs, boulders and streams to jump through. my soon to be 4yr old had a blast!', 'Love this little trail!', 'Nice shady short hike.', ""It's fun, constantly changing, has a running river, lots of trees for shade and big rocks. Pretty dusty tho."", 'Love this shady hike!', 'Easy and very nice. Rock, woods, very small rivers... A variety if elements to enjoy. The ride.

The best part is that a majority of the trail is in the shade, perfect for a summer morning hike! Get there early because parking is quite limited and you need an adventure pass."", 'small trail that goes through campground to waterfall', 'This is a nice low impact hike. Very kid friendly.', ""Short, beautiful, oak-shaded trail to a waterfall. Rated easy, but I would not wear flip flops or take my grandmother on this hike: uneven terrain, some uphill. But if you're somewhat prepared and in shape, well worth doing."", 'Easy short trail.', 'Awesome', 'fun and easy. Only mistake came on a holiday, to many dogs and people.the falls were lovely.', 'Great fast and refreshing hike. Yellow desert vegetation up above, but a lush green garden in the canyon where you get to hike. And a great ending.\n\nHighly recommend for any one looking for a quick, rewarding hike.', 'Really short, accessible and easy.', 'Such fun and easy trail. Good for dogs or kids', 'great trail to go on especially for beginners. took our 4 year old daughter she had great time. was a little tricky to find. there is a camp ground at the trail head and a small parking lot. the lot was full when we arrived had to park on top of the hill about .5 miles from trail. even with parking a bit away from the trail it was still worth it.', ""I love this trail alot!  I came up here for one of my first hikes back in the nineties as a young kid!  The hike is shady, which is perfect for a hot day.  Compared to the nearby Eaton Canyon falls, this is less traveled for some reason, even though it's slightly shorter and easier.  The area next to the falls is a wonderful oasis with some rock climbing hooks along the walls of the canyon.\n\nI put together an episode of my vlog on this trail.  Check it out here:\nhttps://youtu.be/kDgEFBlkoww\nI also put together a playlist for anyone to bring on the trail with them :)\nhttp://sptfy.com/15I8\n\nHave fun on the trail!  Hope to see you out there some time."", ""Went this past Friday! Such a short & pretty hike. The waterfall wasn't flowing too much but still pretty. Went early and completely avoided any crowds. No trash either!!"", 'Great beginner hike. Took our 4 year old they they were able to easily navigate through the crossing streams. Short hike that is shaded and goes along a running creek. Once we got to the waterfall is was pretty crowded though. We did however go on Mother’s Day. Lots of families.Overall great local hike. We are definitely going back and packing some water shoes and extra pants.', 'Easy hike for all ages, the trail was mostly shaded with several stream crossings. The waterfall is majestic, with a huge rock crowning the top of the falls.', 'This hike is beautiful and short if you want a quick escape from the city. When the stream is high, there are many crossings that require either jumping or using rocks as steps to get across. When we visited today, the stream was low so crossing was easy. When you get to the falls, there aren’t many places to sit and relax, so we just turned back after taking some pictures. The hike itself was easy once you get into the canyon. It’s the incline walking to and from your car that gets you!', 'Super fun trail! Great for walking or trail running.', 'Great for beginners. Enjoyed the waterfall.', 'Wow, so happy to find this hike. It’s perfect for my 4 year old and what a great payoff! The waterfall is awesome! Obviously better after some rainfall. The trail is easy to begin and gets slightly more difficult. The trail is almost totally tree covered so hiking is shaded all times of day. Good trail for dogs also. Limited parking and it’s posted that you need an adventure pass but I’ve parked there 3 times and never been cited.', ""Gorgeous trail & waterfall! wasn't expecting to come across a campground, & definitely wouldn't mind staying there for a night.. we did see a young rattle snake on the trail, so keep your eyes peeled "", ""Very buggy this time of year. Was swating bugs out of my face the entire way. Extremely shaded. Expect to pass through many rocks for the last .5 mile to the waterfall. Isn't a waterfall you can soak your feet in. Not many rocks to sit on. It was nice to touch the green moss along the waterfall. Overall not my favorite in LA county."", 'best part was the serenity along trail..so quiet and peaceful..short easy hike..had to walk over a few logs on the trail overall good trip', 'Excellent little hike. I little chilly in morning but excellent scenery, a good flowing waterfall today too!', 'Beautiful after a rainy day! Will definitely come back.', 'Loved the trail!! Great for small kids and pets. Rest area with bench tables and restroom is available at the beginning of the trail. Recommend bringing your own paper or wipes and restroom not in the best condition (door doesn’t lock).Took additional trail (Sunset Ridge Trail) on other side with amazing views overlooking Downtown LA. Other trails connect on top of Sunset trail if you have extra time and energy.', 'One of my favorite easy hikes near LA.  There are never too many people, there’s always water and the terrain is shady. It starts at a nice small campground and ends at a pretty waterfall. If you want to continue to dawn mine you can. Love this hike', 'Easy hike, pretty, lots of water, nicely shaded and good for dogs. You can make the hike harder if you want to.', ""Beautiful trail mostly shady so it was nice even on an 85°+ California day. It's about a mile each way from the campground. The way in is almost entire uphill, and a bit rockier than I initially thought but not too challenging and lots of fun just watch yourself. Saw plenty of kids and dogs along the way so definitely kid friendly and such."", 'There was no internet in the woods, so I was not able to record or map where I was going. I went here with my mom and siblings (11 and 12 yrs). People said there are two trials here, one gets you to the very top and one is a shorter path. I had no idea where those are, so I just followed the sign for Millard Falls. It was fun. Easy hiking through the woods. I think it\'s a great walk/adventure to have with your families:) Either get here early in the morning or late around noon when people are leaving for lunch because parking spaces are VERY limited. Some people were parking at the ""No Parking"" areas. Back and forth from the parking lot to the falls takes about 1:00.', 'Great hike for families. Short hike that does include a bit of “Adventure”, creek crossings, downed trees, and rock climbing. Definitely recommend that for children under 5 you have an adult to hold hands and narrow and loose rock areas. Took a 3 & 4 year old boys and they crushed it. The waterfall was small with a small creek at the top, but perfect for chilling and eating lunch. If it’s warm enough, definitely bring a change of close for kids and even some water shoes as it’s pretty rocky. Parking: make sure to drive to the lower parking lot. It will save you a 1.5 mile walk uphill at the end of the trip. All in all an easy family hike.', 'Great, easy little hike. There was a decent amount of water at the falls and in the creek. Not too strenuous. Saw lots of kids and dogs along the way. When we came back, we diverted at the little concrete spillway, crossed it, and then went left up the trail that passes below the cabins. It was an easy hike up a wide, open, sunny path, and from the top, we could see the entirety of DTLA looking all magical and far-away. It was also nice to warm up before going home. We parked at the parking lot at the very base of the hill and got there around 8:30am, so it was pretty chilly from the lot to the falls in January.', 'Relatively easy going in.. make sure to stop at the first sign at the fork and do a 180... the dirt path with an arrow pointing up is the trail.. it’s ok you are going the right way... awesome views.', 'Went on a morning hike to the Millard Falls. We parked on the 2nd parking lots towards the campground. It was a very easy hike with minimal stress. There’s a trail but its not a very marked, dirt trail. Its very nice to do a rocky and quick hike with kids to explore and dogs too.There’s very little water but it’s still worth the hike (35min-1hr - depends how fast/slow you go) because you’re completely surrounded by the mountains.', 'This is a very easy and peaceful trail.  My 8 year old had no problems and we saw a toddler making his way through.', 'Hiked from the top parking lot. Watch for mountain bikers on the first downhill. The hike up the canyon has a lot of boulder and downed tree hopping. Its a bit challenging, but fun. Nicely shaded. Not too many people. Mostly families. My dog loved it.', 'Took my 6 and 8 year old on this hike and they loved it! We parked down at the lower parking lot. The hike itself is about 1.5 mile but it took us about 90 mins to do it .. we stopped often to enjoy the scenery and climb over the many rocks and look at the creek and the fallen trees... we really enjoyed this hike. At the end was a little waterfall that, although small , was peaceful and relaxing to sit and watch while eating a light snack.', 'Quiet. Easy. Serene.', 'My kids (4 & 6) first hike and now they are in love! They want to go back every weekend. Perfect for the whole family!', 'Perfect trail to take the kids out', 'This trail was a nice surprise.  We brought our parents here for an easy hike and they loved it!  If you follow the map, it adds mileage and some elevation.  We parked at the first parking area and walked down the road to the bottom parking lot.  This was a mistake.  Follow the map along the trail the whole way and it’s a great hike.  We did on the way back and it was a bit of a work out.  Don’t follow the sign to Millard Canyon, that just leads to the lower parking lot. The waterfall was flowing a little and there’s a lot of shade.  We encountered a few mountain bikers, and they were great about sharing the trail.', 'The map for this is incorrect. The map shows the trailhead way up on what is a paved road. Follow the road to the bottom to get to the parking lot for Millard Canyon Falls Trail . It comes in at 1.66 milesRT, so a really short and easy hike. Went in late Nov and there was still some water trickling down the fall. Overall a nice outing, but I was wishing for more mileage .', 'Easy hike but be prepared for several stream crossings. Your shoes might get wet. My kids loved going in the falls in the summer months. In December it’s still a fun hike but water is COLD!', 'Easy trail though you do have to cross the stream on several occasions, climb some rocks and climb over fallen trees.  Still able to see some water at the waterfalls.  Not too many mosquitoes, but enough to require some repellent.  Went on a Thursday and only saw one person at the falls, and no one on the trail.', ""This trail should be upgraded to a moderate trail as the path is hard to find at times and there are places you have to climb. I didn't make it to the waterfall today due to trees being in the way and no signs pointing the way."", 'Beautiful, but short, hike to a nice waterfall.  Passes can be purchased any any Big 5 store as well as ranger stations.  Other outlets sell them as well.', 'Get an adventure pass before get there! There are signs posted in the parking lot that ""vehicles must display pass"", but no mention of where to get one.Nice, easy hike. Go early before it get too crowded.', ""This hike was beautiful. It lacks a star just because it's not as long as I would have liked it to have been. We went out, found the falls and headed back to sunset ridge to get more of a hike in. The terrain had us sweating immensely, it's a lot of crossing over the creek. Watch out for rats. All in all pleasant hike."", 'great and easy trail.', ""This hike was a lot of fun. So many Creek crossing. Trail got a bit confusing at some points but I understand that volunteers are  working hard to clear it after it's reopening. The waterfall had plenty of water this year and there were a lot of spaces for the kids to play in and explore."", 'Amazing hike! Great for beginners two friends took me up here and it was a spur of the moment thing but it turned out to be an amazing experience, the waterfall was completely empty and at sunset it was beautiful!!', 'Might have had a better experience a couple months ago when there was probably more water  flowing.  It is mostly shaded so it could be a good one to do when it is hot.  I guess we should have parked in the 1st available parking area but we continued on and parked in the main lot near the campground and our RT hike was only 1.3 miles.', ""This was a pretty awesome little trail. Although I passed multitudes of people to and from the waterfall, it was by no means crowded. I was able to take plenty of photos of the falls in all of its glory without random individuals in the shots. And if you're up for a short moderate/hard challenge, immediately to the right of the waterfalls base is a trail that'll take you up to the top of the waterfall. It’s definitely worth checking out before the water dries up."", 'Great trail. Maybe slightly harder than easy, which to me means ""no problem doing it in street shoes without exhausting yourself"".  The effort level was easy, but there were a few parts with narrow dirt paths on canyons edges where decent footwear is better. Other than that minor note, the trail was great and almost empty on a weekend with a pleasant waterfall and pool at the end.', 'Great Trail! lots of shade', 'Cool waterfall and plenty of shade.', 'Fun short hike! There was water at the fall, lots of shade throughout the trail, and good for all ages. I will definitely go back.', 'short trail.', 'Short and sweet, I logged 1.6mi out and back from the trail sign. Water was great!', ""Chose to do this one arbitrarily after Sunset Ridge Saddle loop. Since it was only .8 miles from Sunset's entrance I figured I'd check out the fall. The short hike was pretty fun with all the mild stream crossing and rock climbing you'd have to do. Waterfall wasn't immensely impressive but it seemed to have attracted a decent crowd."", 'Nice easy shaded trail', 'Pretty intense for a first trail in Cali.', ""One of my favorite hikes! lots of climbing over rocks and logs. Path is easy, can't get lost."", ""This is a very short hike, not just mileage, but it feels short too. Thus, the loss of a star.Parking: Park at the first tiny parking area, which is the starting point for a few other trails too. You can go further up the road to park at the camp site if you want to cut the trail even shorter, but seriously, this is already a very short hike. Adventure pass is required, so come prepared.From the first small parking lot, head past the gate and a little way up the road. You will come across an informational sign regarding the Mount Lowe Railway on your right. Turn left/around and you'll see the sign directing you down a single person trail leading to Millard Canyon Falls. This extra bit of trail before the campsite at least adds a bit to the hike, and it feels like a little lush tunnel. At the bottom of the trail, you'll pass the campsite. The bathrooms here are disgusting, so don't plan on using them. The campsite itself is full of trash too. A bit of a shame. Head straight ahead past the camp and you'll come to the creek. Don't cross it, just turn right and you'll see the trailhead sign. At this point, you can't get lost.You cross the creek a few times, but it's easy to keep your feet dry right now since the water isn't flowering very high. There's a bit of washout debris to climb over and smallish rocks/boulders, but this short trail is seriously easy.The waterfall was flowing, but not as impressively as it can get after a good rain or on the first warm weekend after the snow season. I've heard it's basically a trickle or nothing in the summer, so no complaints here.Lookout for the California newts. Saw quite a bit of them in the various creek pools.I visited on a Monday at about 10:35 am, and it was lightly trafficked. Had the waterfall to myself for maybe 15 minutes, and shared it with other hikers for another 15. I had my dog with me, and saw many others with small children."", 'Easy hike.

The views of the canyon and the mountains above it are beautiful. I missed the waterfall though (apparently there's a turnoff for it). Overall it's an easy hike, but it seemed harder than most 3-mile trails based on the first mile-and-a-half alone. I also hiked it in 80-degree weather, so the heat was a factor.

I went from sunset ridge down the bike path into the Millard campground through a little kinda rough small trail. It's about a half mile walk up to the waterfall which due to drought was not putting down much water.. Still had a good time. Lots of ppl in the area.

I have been walking this canyon since I was a boy. I love the forest and the wildlife in this area. There had always been something magical about this particular area.

I was raised in San Fernando Valley and as a young man I love waterfalls and read books about caves and outdoor adventures, This was my local choice for an adventure and shared it with many friends and now I'm sharing it with you. I'm sorry I do not have the mileage to these locations. Once you have come to the falls your adventure has not ended but really begins! Along the right side of the falls is a trail that leads to the top of the falls after you get that beautiful view then head farther up the canyon as you do you will find a natural slide that as kids we spent hours here wearing holes in the back of our cutoffs! Continue up the canyon and you will find a short level mine on you left, this is where we camped many a nights. As you continue farther up you will find old mines (all closed) and machinery. This hike close to the city will make you feel like your far away from civilization. I rated it 4 stars based on it's location, I graded on a curve, for the LA area this is a do not miss!

The trails are maintained very very well.', 'Gorgeous, well maintained trail with lots to see. Beautiful views and varied terrains make this one an excellent trail. Good for all levels of hikers.', ""Took the shuttle in (stop 6)  and hiked down the trail to the falls. Shuttle is $8 per person round trip. The trail can be pretty heavily trafficked at times, especially in the summer , especially around the shuttle stops. Between stops, the traffic on the trail decreases significantly, which leads to a very pleasant walk. \n\nReaching the Postpile Monument is quite interesting with a trail going to the top and another at the bottom. The view at the top is nice but not worth it if you're pressed for time. The trail at the bottom offers more interesting photo opportunities. \n\nHiking to rainbow falls is fairly easy. The trail is well maintained overall and not heavily trafficked. The crowds do increase quite a bit when you reach close to the falls as the views impress. The viewpoints in a couple spots are quite good.\n\nHiking back up to the bus stop (stop 10) is a bit hard. It may be the elevation that adds to it but it's harder than any other part of the trail."", ""Had to take the shuttle in, I think 8 dollars round trip, but I think you can drive in before 830am but the road is narrow and buses are hard to get around. 10 dollars per car at the entrance pass the adventure center. Dogs need to be muzzled. Try not too take your dog if she/he is aggressive. Bus drivers don't like to take too many dog per trip so you may be asked to take the next bus. The drive is 30 miles. I have a lab so she barely fit underneath or in front of me. If you have a dog, make sure to get a seat. They have standing room but it's hard with a big dog. Stop 6: Devil Postpile-0.5 miles; Rainbow Falls- extra 1.5-2miles (trail to lower falls is closed 2018) two viewpoints top of falls and lower falls viewpoints. First viewpoint to lower viewpoint is steep so climbing up is a pain.  Trail itself is ok. Kinda up and down in elevation but not too steep. Well marked trail. Can deviate to the river to play in the water with dogs. You can also hike to the Mina--- Falls. Stop 10: The other way to get in or get out: around 1 mile from rainbow falls. This trail is mildly challenging from falls to the stop so it's easier to walk down from this stop but you just see the falls. You are mostly gaining elevation coming back up. Pretty with wildflowers and Forest trees. Passes the PCT trail.  There is a resupply general store here and a little restaurant that is heavily overpriced ($10+ hamburgers and $10 milkshakes) The adventure center has tickets for the gondola and kid challenge structure/ rock wall. You can get a combo of gondola and shuttle 37 dollars each. Morning is best for gondola. No lines. But the food up there does not open till lunch. Summer time is for mountain/dirt bike and a beautiful view at the top. Construction at the top. The museum is nice for kids.Cons: due to recent fires air quality and visibility was sub par."", 'Very busy trail at the end of July.  Yosemite Valley was closed due to fires.  Which explained the heavier crowds in Mammoth Lakes.   As on all trails, take plenty of water for everyone in your group.  Try the west side of the river. Much fewer people.', 'We started at the Rainbow Falls trailhead off of the Red Meadows Shuttle stop #9 which is a shorter hike than this one (1.3 miles one way so 2.6 round trip) You can change it up on the way back and take the Reds Meadow Resort path back to Shuttle stop #10 which is recommended to get out because it is the last shuttle stop and usually fills up the shuttles leaving the area. The trail to the base of the Falls is closed now for 2018 for rerouting and restructuring and will reopen in 2019. Air quality was fine despite the fires but it was dry, hot and windy so bring enough water. The waterfall was beautiful and well worth the hike  according to my seven year old!', 'The waterfall is worth every step it took to get there!!', 'I made the hike to Rainbow Falls with my husband, two year old and five year old. We got dropped off at stop 6 for Devil’s Postpile.It took us a little longer than expected to complete the first leg of the trip (about 2.5 hours) so we decided to take the shortcut back to Red Meadows to make one of the last shuttles back. Mostly flat, sandy paths, with a little uphill/downhill incline on the way there. However the “shortcut” to Red Meadows is steep so be prepared! Devil’s Postpile and Rainbow Falls were pretty cool to see but I am not sure I would make this hike again, a little underwhelmed. We heard bears on the way back which was a little nerve wracking but no actual sightings. Still giving this trail five stars since it was so beautiful and would recommend this overall.', 'Great for a day hike! Loved seeing the rainbow falls and then hiking down to the lower falls to get in the water. Very refreshing with great views the entire time. Brought our pup too. Should note that your dog has to be muzzled for the shuttle ride to the trailhead!', 'Great trail, great views of the Forrest fire that occurred in 1992.  Scenery is unique.  The only steep part is at devils post pile but there are a couple trails to get to rainbow falls.A lot of young families hiking in from the lodge trail head.A lot of work is being done at the falls to kind of “commercialize” it.  And yes, the falls create a rainbow anywhere you view it.', '', 'Tough hike for me as a beginner, but worth it. Bring water shoes for lower falls area. The rocks are sharp if you want to take a break and swim.', 'We started at stop 6 and hiked to Rainbow Falls. Not much shade because there was a fire in the region years ago and trees are growing back. The walk was worth seeing the falls at the end and there really is a rainbow!', ""This is a really fun afternoon.  we started at stop 6 for devil's postpile.  Did the postpile then go up top of it and there's a trail entrance for rainbow falls. as someone else noted it is a sandy walk and can take it's toll. the falls are cool. go to lower falls the trail isn't bad and the river and small falls are great. Then back to stop 10. it ends up in the 5ish mile range. Tiring due to elevation and sandy trail, but totally worth it. Bring water and bug spray and a hat."", 'We took the shuttle to stop 6, hiked to the bottom of the postpile (so unique!), then took the short loop to the top of the postpile (definitely a worthwhile perspective). We continued the trail to the aptly-named rainbow falls, and went an additional ~1/2 mi to the lower falls, where we found a lot of swimmers. On the way back, we hiked to shuttle stop 9, which shaved off a short distance. Fun and unique hike.', 'Summer months are hot up here so make sure you bring lots of water. It’s easy to get distracted and venture off trail since the infamous PCT and JMT run through here.', ""A simple walk through some beautiful forest!! Devil's Postpile was too cool with a nice little shaded area to eat lunch before the rest of the hike to Rainbow Falls. The trail is very sandy and therefore can tire you out a bit so just pace yourself because, although not difficult, we met with a few older folks on the trail that didn't find it to be so easy -- if that's the case for you there are two spots to cut the hike short and head up to Reds Meadow Resort, and you'll still see some amazing sights! Myself, my wife, my 12 year old daughter and 6 year old son did great but we were certainly tired at the end! Rainbow Falls is breathtaking, a great reward at the end of the hike! Just save your strength since you have to then hike back up and out 1.3 miles to the resort and/or shuttle."", 'Beautiful in June! Shuttle drops you off at .4mi from Devil’s Postpile. After that, it’s another 2 mi to Rainbow Falls. While its kid-friendly, the trail isn’t stroller-friendly. A jogging stroller is fine if you are comfortable exercising with one. There are many sunny spots, so make sure you’ve got a hat.', 'Great easy hike for the family and kids. Great swim by the waterfall depending the on water level', 'A Picture is worth a thousand words..but real life is priceless. Seeing pics of DPP does nothing for being there in real life. :)Lots of trails to branch off and choose your route..but it all eventually heads back to the parking lot. Some hills...but most pretty easy to navigate. There are a few spots with steep steps. Camp style bathrooms in parking lot. Road curvy & fairly narrow..suggest leaving the trailer at home.Lots of great photo opps in road & hiking trail.', 'Beautiful easy hike. The Postpile is fascinating and the hike to the falls is easy. Signage is excellent and the trail is dog friendly.', 'Absolutely gorgeous. I have so much fun on this trail. I never miss it when I visit Mammoth. Make sure you smell the trees (trust me)! I remember when I was a kid, I got to hike down to Rainbow Falls, right across the rocks, right up to the falls. But last year when I went, it was blocked off. Not sure if they’ll open that path again. I hope so. Anyway, on the way back, instead of going back to the Postpile, I went to Red Meadows and took the shuttle back from there for different views. There’s also a market.', '', 'Great trail..', 'Overall the hike was decent. The scenery along the trail was pretty boring. Lots of burnt and cut down trees from the fire 25 years ago... the falls were pretty but I wouldn’t say the hike is worth it. There are many other hikes in the area that I would recommend over this one. For people that hike often, this hike is underwhelming... but if you don’t get to hike often, this hike may be a good one as it is not strenuous at all. (Except one or two short uphill climbs).', 'A ""should do""... to see it.  But a bit crowded for the avid hiker.', 'Beautiful!', ""Loved the hike. It was hot outside but my favorite waterfall in the history of my California hiking trips. Even on a cloudy day when the sun peeks out the rainbow appears. If your tired from the hike and don't want the 2.5 miles back, keep right and follow the sign that says shuttle 9&10 0.7mls BUT it's uphill to some parts of it. Worth it all"", ""There were many people on the trail, but it was fine.  It is a little bit steep and seemed a little bit far for my 75 year old mom . She's kind of fit. Overall it was gorgeous and very enjoyable for an afternoon adventure!"", 'A little strenuous for me but lots of shade and great views!', 'Short hike worth the view! Bring lunch or a snack and watch the waterfall while you eat on the big rock at the destination.', ""Started at Ranger's Station and hiked to Minaret Falls then back to Devil's Postpile which was spectacular! Took the trail to Rainbow Falls but veered off to enjoy the bridge over San Joaquin River. Then back to Rainbow Falls which was gorgeous! The trek up to Red Meadows was tiring and kind of steep. But at least there's a small general store (cold drinks and ice cream too), tiny restaurant and clean bathrooms waiting for you before taking the shuttle back. Loved this hike!"", 'For the short hike the destination on this trail is a must.', 'Hiked this trail 2 days ago.  Hiked it the opposite way.  Started at Falls trail head and ended up at the Ranger Station near the Devils Postpile trail head.  I would recommend this route.  It was moderate downhill at first and then a gradual climb out.  I preferred this to the gradual downhill and then a moderate climb out for 1 mile.  The road was fully open and shuttles were running.  No snow issues on trail or road.', 'Great hike, but super busy trail.  If you want a more isolated hiking experience from Devils post pile to the falls, wait 15 minutes after the shuttle drops off the busload of people at the Devils PP trail head to let the crowd go ahead, and start on the trail before the next shuttle bus drops off.', 'Hotter than I expected but beautiful view! And we walked down to the lower falls and got in the water. Super fun little hike.', ""Loved it. Went from Devils to Rainbow to Red Mountain but if you come back to bus stop 10 it's all up hill."", ""Getting to this hike (and many others in the area) is a struggle right now, because the road to Devil's Postpile is closed due to snow damage.  Bikes are allowed on the road.  The bike ride down to Devil's Postpile is awesome, because it is all downhill (about 6-7 miles).  As you might expect, the ride back up is not fun.  Because the road is closed, we had both Devil's Postpile and Rainbow Falls to ourselves.  Both are impressive. The trail is fairly easy, but there isn't much shade between Devil's Postpile and the falls, so bring plenty of sunscreen and water.  We also hiked down to Lower Rainbow Falls, which was farther from the upper falls than expected, but worthwhile."", ""Very nice hike!! I highly recommend it, it is beyond beautiful and for the most part is shaded except for when you cross through the part of the woods that burned down a while back. Seen lots of deer. If you like getting wet go below the bridge that horses use to cross (I stop there every time) I've done this hike once a year for about 5 or 6 years now-I am currently 17 so yes it is kid friendly. We've never taken our dogs. If you are starting from devils post-pile and you want to get wet before the long journey go through the meadow it's very pretty and cold water is refreshing (I usually stop there on the way back). Everyone should do this hike"", ""Just wanted to throw a tip up here that wasn't obvious from reading recent reviews. As of mid-May 2017, you can't access the postpile from Mammoth Lakes at all. The 203 is completely covered in snow starting at the Mammoth Mountain Main Lodge and going east towards the postpile. (The US Forest Service site does mention a road closure, but it's always a pain to interpret those notices unless you're familiar with the area.) I don't know if there is an entrance to the monument from the west, but if you're planning on coming in from the east, definitely give the Mammoth Lakes Welcome Center/Ranger Station a call at 760-924-5500 to check about access."", 'Easy trail!', 'Great views of the waterfall!', 'Did this hike with my wife as our warm up for the backpack trip that followed a few days later.  Nice trail and quite busy with people of all ages.  The falls are great in early summer.  Camped out one night at Minaret Falls campground.  Doing so allows you to be able to drive down the road otherwise you have to take the shuttle.  The trail takes you past the Devils Post pile first, then continues down to the Falls. We hiked on the trail that brings you to the top of the post pile when we came back from the falls.  Neat to see the Basalt columns from on top.  Nice easy walk and can be hot during the middle of the day', 'Lovely, easy hike. Completed it with a friend in October 2016, not too hot or too cold. I like harder hikes, but this is great for the family, or a half day trip', 'Magnificent.', ""This hike is great! I really like how you park, buy a shuttle ticket at the ski resort and the bus takes you on a huge loop around the park. There are many short hikes you can elect to do, just hop off at the stop( they give you a map at the ticket window). When your hike is complete, just wait for the bus to haul you out or to the next trailhead.  Devils post pile is one of the hikes and it's a great one! Once you reach the post pile, continue down the trail to Rainbow Falls. When your done, head up the hill to the bus stop. There is a store and restrooms.  It's a cool hike that's on a well used trail."", 'One of my favorite hikes! Rainbow falls is gorgeous and  devils post pile is mesmerizing.', 'Beautiful falls! The actual hike to the falls is relatively flat and family friendly. Watch out for sharp rocks below the waterfall, someone cut open their foot while I was there', 'Very nice hike', 'awesome', ""Went here after the Devil's Postpile, it was a nice trail and offered some more amazing views once you got to the waterfall"", 'It was a great and rewarding experience. The view was amazing and a good workout to boot.', ""Amazing hike, it never gets old!!  It's super smart to go very early in the morning around 5am so that you yourself can drive down there and park wherever you want.  I have taken the bus down there and i had to stand the whole time and quite frankly, i think any Californians or hikers will admit that having to stand in a packed bus isn't our cup of tea and we're not used to it.  Also there are MANY tourists that you can avoid as well.  Get up super early when it's still dark and drive down to Devils Postpile and catch the trail.  You have to be at the entrance before, i believe, 7am or else they will not let you in!  At this early in the morning, you can't see the rainbow at the falls because the sun doesn't hit it yet, but it is worth it.  You might see one or two people, and it is so calming.  Birds chirping and the sun rising, nothing beats it.  This is amazing compared to the hundreds of people trying to get a peak at the waterfall, and hundreds of people on the trail alone.  But whatever you end up doing, enjoy the whole experience!"", ""Beautiful hike with nice views. Waterfall had a good amount of water and we even saw a rainbow. We walked over the top of Devil's Postpile which offered more views and a closeup look on the hexagon patterns. Total distance including hike back along the road was 5.9miles"", 'Easy stroll for the average person. We hiked here off of the PCT as a quick detour. Crowded ... But beautiful.', ""We went in the evening, after 7pm, when you didn't have to take bus anymore and could just drive down the parking, right next to the Devil's Postpile. This way we were almost completely alone on the trail and were able to marvel at the monument in relative solitude. \n\nDuring the day it's possible to take the bus to the Devil's Postpile stop and then it's only 0.5 miles to the sight, a little more if you want to go on top and see the hexagon squares on the surface.\n\nMore photos: https://csgirllife.wordpress.com/2016/09/15/devils-postpile/"", ""Probably more spectacular earlier in the summer, but the trail was great for my husband, dogs & me!  The falls we're still nice, just not as full as the photos I've seen and no rainbow."", 'The scenery going to the falls is outstanding! We decided to connect to the Pacific Crest Trail and get off the beaten path on our way back to the falls, which was well worth it. The trail going back to the bus stop is all up hill so caution should be taken for people with health conditions. Over all I think it is worth going to see.', 'Nice family trail. Always very crowded. Still very beautiful and great for kids.', 'Nice trail. Easy and almost flat. The waterfall is gorgeous. Mind the sun in summer - not a lot of shadows towards the fall.', 'This was a beautiful breath-taking hike.  This time of the year was perfect since it was not too hot or cool.  We took the trail also to Rainbow Falls.  There was some steep hills to climb but overall it was a moderate hike.', 'Go in the morning to beat the heat of summer, but go in the afternoon light if you want to see beautiful colors on the monument and rainbows in the falls', ""We only did the hike from Red's, Easy hike from there, although trees are burnt out from forest fire years earlier, could get warm mid-day,  Stairs to the bottom of the falls were closed, wish we would have known, would given a higher rating if we could have gotten down to the river!"", ""This hike was tough for me. I'm not used to the elevation and it was really against me on that hot day. It's mostly in the sun due to the fire years ago. Wear a hat and sunscreen. We had two camelbacks (5L total) between two kids and and two adults and tapped them both out by the time we got to the shuttle pickup. My 7yr old did pretty well on this hike. Definite times of complaining and wanting to give up, but he was so happy he went on when we reached Rainbow Falls. My husband hiked this with our 29lb 3yr old on his back in a carrier and did it with relative ease. It's definitely worth continuing on after you reach Devil's Postpile."", 'Easy hike. This place is such an interesting thing to discover.

Since, I\'ve done this walk a bunch of times and it is always interesting to see. Definitely hike up to the top of the postpile. The view is beautiful and the rock ""tilework"" is amazing to see. Even though I am in pretty good shape hiking-wise, the climb to the top can still be a bit tough for me. It is much easier to hike to the top from the north (closest to the ranger station) as it is very steep but quick (like a really long flight of stairs), whereas the south side hike is very long, but is steep enough that you wish it would end. The ranger station sometimes has some pretty interesting exhibits for kids and the interested.\n\nThis trail is very crowded, so don\'t expect solitude. The bus can be a real nightmare when it is busy. I\'ve had to stand and hold on for dear life most times I have taken the shuttle this summer. Shoulder seasons and weekdays after school starts (late-August) are much less crazy.\n\nTip: To increase (though not guarantee) your chances of getting a seat, hike to Reds Meadow Resort and get on the bus there.', ""This hike is a must do for people that have never been to Mammoth. The falls can be accessed from the designated trailhead, Reds Meadow, or Devils Postpile. If you're in shape and only want to pay for the shuttle once (you can drive in before 7am and after 7pm without having to take the shuttle), you can start at Devils Postpile, see it, and then continue on to Rainbow Falls.\n\nThe trail is very sandy (like the beach), and due to a fire in 1992, there is very little shade. Sunscreen, sunglasses, or a hat, and water is a must. This can make the hike a bit of a slog, but the destination is worth it. Climb down the stairs to the falls where you can take a dip in the chilly water and take a lot of nice pictures. People rarely go to Lower Rainbow Falls, but it is an interesting sight. Lower falls is not as impressive as the main falls, but the rock formations *are* impressive. The hike back can be pretty challenging because of the previously mentioned sand and sun... but is also uphill. Just take it at a comfortable pace."", ""beautiful hike and amazing scenery! the day we hiked was busy, and I felt like I was the only one on the trail saying hello to people (don't understand why people don't acknowledge one another when hiking...) - but everyone that we were around was courteous and called out people for leaving trash on the trail too! worth the bus ride down & buying a muzzle for the dog to ride the transportation!"", 'Crowded trail, not that impressive.', ""Dogs allowed.

I tried finding this particular hike among the prefab trails on this website but it doesn't exist. Total miles were just under 10 miles.  Started at 10 am at Horseshoe Lake to trailhead for Mammoth Pass. Hiked up the mountain for the first 0.8 miles, then leveled off, then started the very slow descent into Red's Meadow. Had lunch at the cafe at Red's Meadow resort's small cafe, then hiked on to Devil's Postpile. No hikers on Mammoth Pass (just two riders on horseback). Didn't see anyone until we got to the stables at Red's Meadow Resort. Talked to several hikers doing the Pacific Coast Trail (from Mexico to Canada)--and boy, do I admire these hikers! I would do this hike again because you get several phases: 1) beautiful forest; 2) forest growing from 1992 fire with fantastic views of the Minarets, Devil's Postpile, etc., as you look westward, and 3) the valley portion including Devil's Postpile. Took the shuttle back to Mammoth Ski Resort, then took free shuttle down to Mammoth Village.

We head down the other side and towards Rainbow Falls. Interesting sights along the way including the regrowth from a fire over 20 years ago and all of the trees down from the 180mph winds in late 2011.  Once you get to Rainbow Falls there are so many photo ops!  For those with strong knees, take the 100 steps to the bottom and dip your feet in the water - the mist from the falls feels great!  I do recommend going a bit past Rainbow Falls to Lower Rainbow. It is very pretty and there are fewer people.  A great place to sit and relax before the trip back.

The trail was connected to the Devil\'s Post pile trail so there were quite a few people on the trail but all in  all a decent hike. It was in the middle of summer so it was pretty hot when I went up but once you reach the falls and go down to the base of the falls it is really cool you can play a bit in the water and cool off. The trail itself is really easy to follow and you can see where wild fires had taken their toll on the land, but you can also see all of the new growth as well so that was pretty cool to see. On the way out the steps down to the falls are about 6"" to a foot high so I had some pretty so we had pretty sore thighs later but it was worth it. \n\nI really liked going down the falls and seeing just how the falls has been cutting into the mountain.

My favorite is to start at the Devil's Postpile Ranger station and hike through to Rainbow falls. This route will take you by Devil's Postpile, which is an awesome example of Columnar Basalt, on your way to the falls. To shorten the hike you can also begin at the Red's meadow resort to shorten hike but will miss the postpile. The Rainbow Fall are so pretty.

last week although it was awesome I wish I was more prepared. Make sure you have spikes as some parts of the trail are covered with ice. As for the peak make sure you take walking poles and gators so your feet won’t get wet.', ""Trained like mad at 20% incline on treadmill - did a couple of 11,000 vertical feet weeks and one 22,000  foot week. And then ran this with my 22 year old son.  Took off at 7:11 AM, got to ranger station at 10:30 refilled water and filled out registration left the station at 10:50 and got to top at 12:20.  Ouch. It was so funny, my son's hip flexers stopped working and he ran like Charlie Chaplin the last five miles.  It was my I T bands that were killing.  Weather was perfect.  Cool and dry. Salt encrusted completely by the end. What I would do differently - take moister snacks.  The cliff bars were gag dry and hard to eat while running, and test your hydration pack.  Mine was leaking air by the mouth piece and so I was drinking mostly air.  Had not used this in a few years and it had lost its seal.  November - but far the best time to do this if it has not snowed yet."", '...pretty much what everyone else said. Yes, the first mile can be a little much but really only because you’re just getting started. Yes, the last two miles (the traverse) to Long Valley are the most difficult. Yes, the blazes (white dots) that mark the trail can be missed real easily, so definitely get the Pro version if only for this hike. Once you pass 4300’, keep going. If you turn around you’ll walk into a furnace and chances are you’ll hurt yourself more than if you just keep going up.Take the chance to enjoy the sunrise on the way up. The views are really what make this hike so epic — enjoy them while you’re up there. When you hit the summit, take a look at the cabin but don’t be a douche and trash it. If you have extra food consider leaving it here for other hikers in emergency situations. When you’re done, have a beer. Chances are you’ve never deserved it more.The rest is all just my technical notes, so don’t read on if you’re not interested.Do not read the following and think that you can do what I did. It was somewhat stupid, and I’m extremely lucky NOTHING happened on my hike. I am an experienced hiker, but definitely not at such high altitudes. Maybe train a little before this one, it’s a doozy.Unfortunately, I have a problem stopping once I start. Fortunately, I don’t know how to quit once I start. I started this hike at midnight, but had no intention of going as quickly as I did. I went through 2L of water on the way up. I hit Long Valley Ranger Station at 7:45am. Once I got there I had 3 kid-sized oatmeal bars, and a handful of jerky. I refilled my reservoir to 3L, and stretched a little.Started towards the peak around 8, but went much slower on the second half. I hit the summit exactly at noon. I took a break in the Peak Shelter where I changed out of some of my layers, and ate some more jerky. I left a few oatmeal bars in the emergency locker......started down to the tram around 12:30, and went slowly, again. I ran out of water one mile from the tram, but it was shaded and just knowing I was about to finish kept me going. Hit the tram at 3:30, and then I hit the bar for a beer.I started the hike in two wool shirts, longjohns, heavy wool socks, zip-off pants, a hoodie, gloves, and a beanie. A headlamp (the brighter the better) is an absolute if you’re hiking at night. I had my rain gear as well as a tarp in case a storm blew in suddenly. Hiking poles are a lifesaver, and maybe invest in some athletic knee braces. A wide hat and sunscreen will be used the second half of the hike and you’ll be glad for them.I took 12 kid-sizes oatmeal bars, two big bags of jerky, a small bag of jerky, two pro-bars, and a bag of pistachios. I had 3L of half water/half Gatorade and carried two extra bottles of each with me. I seriously only had four of the oatmeal bars and didn’t even finish the small bag of jerky, but I’m glad I had more than enough in case it was needed. I killed the drinks, and wish I had taken just one extra water bottle.If you read this far, nice. Again, don’t do what I did. Take it slow-ish. Stop every once in a while to rest your legs, and eat a little. Take goo with you if you’re like me and have a hard time eating solids while hiking. Refill at the ranger station, and use your common sense. If you get to Long Valley and you’re tired, or hurting, take the tram. It’s an awesome hike, but it’s not awesome enough to hurt yourself or risk others safety saving you.', 'Not an avid hiker but in good shape. This hike is no joke. Started at 2am and it was such a blessing finally seeing the ranger station after the continuous vertical slope. Did this without poles and that’s the one thing I regret not using. Bring lots or water and gel packs. Started cramping on the last vertical stretch before the ranger station. I wouldn’t recommend doing this hike unless you have trained for it. I won’t be doing this hike again for a long time!', ""Goes without saying, this hike is beyond intense and belongs on any serious hiker's bucket list. We did C2C in November which is a little late but there was no snow yet so we actually had a 40 - 60 degree range the whole time. Just to state the obvious - headlamps, layers, gloves and at least 6L of water/Gatorade, calories (plus emergency supplies). Super awesome hike though, beautiful scenery throughout and a huge sense of accomplishment once you finally hit that tram. Be safe!P.S. this fortunately did not end up being the case for us, but if you end up missing the last tram at night, the ranger recommended sleeping in the bathroom of the ranger station which is heated and protected from the elements. Just throwing that out there!"", 'Awsome hike. After the second time  I did it.', 'Amazing hike experienced with my five experienced hikers. Started 2:30am at the bottom in palm spring and reach to the summit by 1pm then heading down to the tram exactly 6pm to catch up our ride down. We finished 23.3 miles total.  Most challenging hike so far. Stick pole is a must and good headlights. When you reach to the rangers station dont forget to refuel yourself and rest. heading to the summit is strenuous due to some thin air because of the high elevation. hydrate enough and eat energy bars will help. Recommended for advance and serious hikers.', 'Bring treking poles, it is all up hill.', 'Blows your mind. Tough cookie. Train Hard. Carry lots of Water. Start as early as 1 am.', 'Went cactus to tram and left at 2am. Got to tram about 10:40. Got lost once. Thank goodness for all trails gps to get us back on track. Read the hiking guys directions and have his landmark pictures ready. Easy to get lost in the dark. Had 6L of water and used all of them. Absolutely hardest hike I’ve done. You are climbing for 8 hours straight and the first mile and last 2 are brutal. Make sure you are properly fueled before you go. I crashed a bit in the first mile because I had nothing before we left. The valley is a beautiful sight when you get there!! Good luck!', 'Incredible hike! Extremely challenging and not for the faint of heart. October is the perfect time of year weather wise - cool at the bottom and no snow on the top. I recommend starting long before the sun rises to allow ample time to gain altitude before the desert floor begins getting hot. Packing list Hiking boots or trail runners (trail is in great condition and has excellent surface)All Trails Premium Version with GPS map tracker (it is challenging to navigate the first 4-5 miles at night and the turn by turn nav makes all the difference)Headlamp with extra batteries just in case 1G of water (Minimum amount. I drank 1.5G before the ranger station where there is a refill tap. This water is heavily chlorinated but potable) Camelbak will make your life much easier along with extra bottled water to refill it.Food (This hike is extremely challenging and requires you to keep your caloric intake up to make sure you don’t bonk before the top) Wind jacket or shell (The peak can be quite cool and windy. If starting later in the year Dec/Jan I’d recommend a light down jacket as well)Activity tracker to monitor distance Hiking poles (I did not use these nor did I bring them during the hike. I felt they weren’t required for the ascent and there is minimal descending to the tram station and therefore not really required. Pack as light as possible. It is 17 miles to the peak from Palm Springs Art Museum the majority of which is straight up! Any extra weight is a huge disadvantage.', ""Amazing hike. We got a late start and camped halfway up the mountain in some random spot. Went to the top on day 2 and took the tram down. This hike is an aggressive workout, especially if you're carrying gear. No water on trail in February. Not for the faint of heart. I would recommend."", 'Completed Cactus to Clouds.. Beautiful views and sunrise, also super intense elevation gain and temperature change. Bring layers for the top, there was already snow on the ground. First 8,000 feet climb on Skyline was unbelievably difficult. Next 6 to the top peak was all about keeping going. I would recommend eating every few thousand feet at least, we did every 4,000, with water hydration backpacks for water throughout, and trekking poles are a must. Took us 11.5 hours from the bottom to the top back down to the tram. Brought 1 gallon of water, 1 liter of Gatorade, 2 cookies, trail mix and 2 sandwiches, for each of us, was perfect amount. Have fun! Enjoy the views and the success of summiting!', 'killer hike. GPS map of trail and trekking poles were a game changer.', ""Great hike! Did it to the ranger station as a training hike for GC r2r2r. The first couple and last couple miles are tough and easy to lose the trail....especially the last couple. Started at 4:47 am....finished 10:39 am. Would come to do the full Cactus to Cloud. Wouldn't hike back down. Much easier too lose the trail and risk injury going down!"", 'I did this trail on October 12th which seemed like the ideal time of year to tackle this hike. The average high in Palm Springs is 91 in October, but it doesn’t get that hot until around noon, and since you’ll be climbing, you never really have to worry about the heat.\n\nI got off to a later start than I had originally planned and left the trailhead at 6:45am, right at sunrise. No headlamp hiking for me. And honestly, it was a lot better than hiking in the dark. Even with the white dots lining the trail to the picnic tables, I still made a couple of wrong turns and had to use my Garmin GPS to get back on track. And then, after the picnic tables, the white dots pretty much disappear. There are a lot of tangents and spur trails that can easily take you off course if you aren’t paying attention to a GPS unit. I can’t imagine how much longer the hike would take in the dark. Also, the best thing about hiking in daylight are the views. When the sun is rising over the Coachella Valley, it’s a gorgeous sight to behold.\n\nIt took me 6 hours to get to Long Valley, and like everybody says, the last 2 miles up are brutal. When you combine the steepness of the trail with the fact that you’re now at elevations of 6,000 to 8,000 feet, the exhaustion really affects you. My legs felt heavy, and I felt like my entire body was moving in slow motion. When you finally reach Long Valley, it’s a huge relief, not only because the worst part of the hike is over, but also because you know you won’t die. The throngs of day hikers and school children on field trips are actually a welcome sight.\n\nThat said, you still have another 11 miles to hike. My biggest mistake was not refilling my water at the ranger station. By the time I had finished my lunch at Long Valley, I had 2 liters left and figured that would be enough to finish the hike. But even though the last 5.5 miles to the summit aren’t steep at all—at least compared to the 9 miles you’ve already done—the elevation and the exhaustion really take over. I was really dragging on those last few miles to the top—I could tell because the day hikers who saw me were like, “Almost there, dude. Keep going.” By the time I reached the summit, my 2 liters of water were almost gone.  I feel like another liter or two would have helped out enormously.\n\nBut the euphoria of reaching the summit gave me the shot of adrenaline I needed to finish the hike. It’s an amazing 360 degree view. And because it was late in the day, I had it all to myself.  The views on the entire trail are great, but the summit really is the cherry on top, and it makes the entire 10,500 foot climb worth it.\n\nThe remaining 5.5 miles back to the tram will take a couple of hours, but it’s on a very nice downhill grade—you won’t be killing your feet or your knees. Because it’s an official park trail that is heavily trafficked and well-defined, it is very easy to follow.  Honestly, I would save the night hiking for the evening hours when you’re coming down the mountain because the San Jacinto Park trails are much easier to follow than the Skyline Trail—just be mindful that the final tram ride down the mountain is at 9:45pm (non-summer hours). Upon your arrival at the tram station, treat yourself to a beer... or two... or three... or four at the bar on the third floor. You’ve earned it.', 'Great hike! Very long and tiring', ""They weren't kidding. This is a serious trail. I couldn't get there at 0100 because I had to work Friday and I'm in 29 Palms. I hit the trailhead at 0300, temperature was 91 in Palm Springs. This trail is tough to follow in the dark, and there are some very dangerous drop-offs and narrow ledges. I highly recommend downloading the trail through the Pro version and following the GPS. I could have saved myself some wasted time and energy. The first couple of miles and the last 3 before you reach the tramway are very steep. there are some portions before the tram that were legit 40% inclines. I was down on all fours many times. I didn't manage to finish. Reaching the tramway was all I had. I took 4 liters of water and a liter of Body Armor and it barely lasted me to the Ranger Station. I wish I could have started at 0100, it might have let me get to SJ Mountain. As it was, I was proud of the effort. I only saw 2 other people on the trail. You have to be a bit nuts to try this one in July, I guess."", 'Amazing and brutal. I recommend starting at 1:00am.', ""I almost died. don't do this hike on 3 hours sleep.I think most people can do this. there is no real steep part, it just zigzags a lot. it's really long though so make sure you can handle walking for 12 hours."", 'Done on November 5th, 2017. Started sharp at 1am with full moon. We made to the top around 1pm. Last 2-3 miles where way less steep, but tiredness and elevation made us slow down a lot (big lunch break at ranger station). There was frost on top. With full moon and cool weather, I think is any serious hiker can do it. Easier than Iron Mountain!\nOnce you get at the Tram (bottom one) go to the cafeteria/coffee area (even if is close) to the back on the left side of the room there some multi-charging phone cables to charge phone (in case need to call a ride to go back to the museum)', 'Second time I’ve done this hike, I’m ten years older now and felt every bit of it. This hike is relentless. It’s not too difficult or technical, but it does take planning and tenacity. All in all,I went through 5 liters of water, 4 Cliff Bars, 1 protein bar, 2 goos, and a pack of rehydration salts. Started shortly after midnight and summitted around 1 pm with a large group moving at a slow pace. Started with 3 liters of water and still had about half a liter when I refilled at the ranger station. The key to this hike is timing, you have to get out of the valley long before the sun comes up.', 'We did the hike on May 27, 2018. We started from the trailhead near the museum at 4 am, reached Long Valley just past 10. After long break and lunch at Long Valley, we arrived the peak at 2 pm. We were back to Long Valley about 4 pm. The changing views along the way and the view at the summit is impressive. But the challenge is not as great as we feared before the hike. I think it is slightly difficult than the Rim to Rim Hike in Grand Canyon. But it is well easy than the R3, which we did last year.', ""Amazingly beautiful with a ridiculous view at the top. Hard hike but definitely not as hard as the mythology behind it would have you believe. Mostly requires the right prep. Both me and my buddy were in ok shape and trained for a few months. Did Iron Mt. one week out to test ourselves and parts of that we're actually tougher than C2C. Lucked out with amazing 85f weather on memorial day. Started at 2am, hit long valley by 10a, the peak by 2:30 (I was dragging from elevation nausea), back the tram at 6. 16 hours total but we took LOTS of breaks. Brought 5.5 L of water (didn't need it all on the skyline but best to be safe), 1 gatorade with extra salt in it (my buddy did salt pills), ate 9 GU gels, 3 clif bars and a banana. The biggest thing is just to keep fueling/hydrating yourself and taking the GUs almost hourly was a huge help I think. I got a Charley Horse in my quad pretty early on but was able to work through it. Used a GPX on our phone and had a Sat beacon for emergencies. GPS is huge help for the first 3rd of the skyline which you will prob do in the dark and has a lot of splitting. After that the trail is impressively well maintained and clear, and the notch at the top of the skyline trail is all switchbacks so it's hard but not awful. The push to the summit was the worst part for me. It's not steep but it just takes forever (lots of traversing) and by that point you are exhausted. Def need warm clothes for the summit. Hooded windbreaker and gloves were lifesavers.\n\nBTW, as we were cresting the notch at 10am 2 trail runners ran past us the opposite direction having already summited mid-C2C2C. We had seen lights ahead of us early so they prob started just before 2a and looked fresh as hell 22 miles in at 10. So yeah... goals."", 'We started C2C on Saturday morning at 3am.  We hadn’t done any similar hikes before.  It is the hardest hike we’ve done so far.  It was consistently steep from the start until you reached Long Valley.  The view at the peak was worth it.  For us, there were three essentials for completing this hike (aside from food and water):  hiking shoes, offline map, and a phone charger if you are using your phone for the offline map.  It is easy to get lost so a gps is a must.  Per person, we brought 1 gallon of water, 32 oz of Gatorade, 3 GU gels, 5 granola bars, and 2 sandwiches.  We didn’t have to refill our water at the ranger station since we had plenty of supply left when we got there.  It was so cold and windy at the peak so I’m glad I brought a sweater.  Overall, this is an awesome hike for experienced hikers. Plan ahead and check the weather.', 'Started at  3 am made it to the tram at noon and after grabbing lunch at Peaks restaurant and wandering around made the peak at 4 pm.. Alllllll day hike, the majority of your pack weight should be water. In case you get hung up in lower elevation. You’ll need salts too. Great hike all in all.I had to turn off GPS though because I didn’t want to drain my battery life for pictures and such.', 'This was all worth it! I loved the transition from desert to forest! It feels like two different hikes! We started at around 4:00 am made it to the top in 11 hours and got back to the tram at 5:00 pm.', ""Whoa. 11,000 ft of climbing! Started solo at 4:30 am with a headlamp, climbed and climbed for a little less than seven hours to hit the summit. (+ an extra two hours / 3000 ft of descent back to the tram and some french fries.) Despite a ton of experience on similar terrain -- especially at the lower elevations, the trails aren't that different than those I run in Scottsdale - I did have a little trouble finding the optimal route at times. Nothing serious, just added a bit to the growing paranoia one sometimes get when hiking unknown trails alone.  Gear-wise, I brought a 70oz Nathan pack for water and like 20 Gu-type packets. I tucked a somewhat heavy technical hoodie into my pack and tied a light long sleeve shirt around my waist, but I ended up only using my long sleeve shirt for a few mins while I was chillin' (literally) at the summit.\n\nDifficulty-wise, I'd put it in the same class as a Mt Whitney or a Pike's Peak or a Grand Canyon R2R. BTW - current record according to Strava? 3:35!"", 'Amazing transitions from valley floor to high desert and into a true alpine ecosystem. Stout hike', 'First trail I’ve done on the West coast. Very challenging of course for being an east coast mountain guy. Started at 2345 and reached the tram station around noon. Reached the peak around 1600, and tram station around 1900. The toughest trail I’ve done and felt like it would never end. We didn’t get a chance to see the Mt. at day light before we hiked so taking the tram down made us realize how monstrous of a mountain/ hike this was. All in all I loved the challenge and learned the true meaning of “hike your own hike! Bring 4-6 L of water and a first aid kit, it become very useful. Tracked a total of 22 miles', ""April 28, 2018 - No snow, a bit windy on top but a wind breaker was enough\n\nGreat hike, and very strenuous. I did the C2C2C, so I didn't take the tram down - according to my GPS going to the top is more like 16 miles so alltrails seem a bit off (2x=32 and about 11500 total elevation change). It's the hardest trail I've done so far. It's possible but quite a challenge 4AM to 7PM, without much stop other than refill water. And I'm a decently fast uphill hiker. The view is nice, and it is special to start in the desert with flowering cacti, get to tree level, and having this wonderful view up top. Also by starting at night, you don't get to see much of the desert at first (if you start early enough) but you get to see it if you go down. \n\nSo if you are looking for a butt kick, go for it, either up to the ranger station, up to the peak, or even C2C2C. The good thing is that thanks to the tram and ranger station, you have a way out if you tackle more than you should have. And you have refills of water (at least it was possible when I did it). \n\nRegardless of what you do, you should know that starting at night is THE way to do this - I started at 4 AM and I think most people start at 3. The trail is decently marked, and it was full moon so I didn't use my headlamp (except after being flared by other hikers). Having a GPS is nice anyway to not lose any time wondering, but not an absolute must-have. By starting early, you get to be already up 3-4k up already, so it won't get as hot once you are in the trees. The other thing to know is bring a lot of water, but when I did it, you could refill water at the ranger station. I brought about 4 L, and drank all day about 13-14 L to give you an idea. \n\nIf you want to try to go the whole way, here are the time to give you some idea if you are late and should bail. As I said before, I'm a decently fast uphiller, so it's good to keep in mind when planning your day.\n\n4:15 AM start\n9:15 Ranger station (+water)\n12:00 Peak\n2:45 Start decent from ranger station (+water)\n7:00 Back to palm spring"", 'Awesome! Great variety. Go from desert to pine forest to cold summit. Very physically demanding. I started at 5:30am, reached the ranger station at noon, and the summit by 3pm. It is a super tough hike to get to the state park. It is much easier from there on. I packed about 3 liters of water and a bottle of Pedialite, plus plenty of snacks. Seemed to work out pretty well. I had about a liter of water left and a little Pedialite by the time I got to the ranger station but I am good about not drinking that much so you may need more. I stopped every hour and a half to two hours for a drink and snack. You can refill water at the ranger station and also you need to fill out a permit there to keep going. I took the tram back down the mountain. Seriously though, if you are not in pretty good hiking shape, this may not be for you, but if you are, definitely go for it. It is a fantastic hike, and I personally felt super accomplished when I reached the summit of San Jacinto. Not to mention the view at the top was amazing. I would def do it again, only if I did I would hike it all the way back down.', 'Love', ""Preparation and patience is key for this hike.  I suggest starting around 3am because it does get quite hot even before sunrise below the 4300 feet landmark.  Bring 4-6L of water for the ascent on the Skyline trail section and take ample breaks if you feel fatigued.  While I strongly advise sticking to a routine of cardiovascular exercise in the weeks leading up to C2C, reaching the summit is a very attainable goal.  Be smart, but don't be too intimidated by what you might read on this site or others. The San Gabriel Mountains provide many great hikes at moderate-to-high elevations to help train for this endeavor."", 'Toughest trail Ive done yet. Good training tool to get in shape, crazy shape.', 'Hard and Rewarding hike.', ""TLDR: This is a very challenging day hike worthy of its reputation. With proper training and planning you too can check this one off your day hike bucket list. \n\nSo long as you can COMFORTABLY complete the prerequisite hikes like Baldy via Bear Canyon, Big Iron (San Gabriels) and San Gorgonio via Vivian Creek, then you'll be fine tackling the 10k feet of gain and somewhat long distance of C2C. If you are not comfortable with those hikes, then don't attempt this or you may be in trouble...\n\nThe real challenge of C2C is the heat. The climb starts in the desert so plan accordingly. That means monitor the weather forecast closely. Carry more water than you ever think you'll need. Keep your diet in check IE don't eat garbage or drink alcohol beforehand.\n\nI've read that you need to run marathons or ultras to complete this trail. That's all BS. Sure ultra runners train on Skyline, but you don't need to be that hardcore to complete it.  All you need to do is train with similar day hikes and BE SMART. Doing something stupid like not respecting the heat of the desert can literally get you killed."", '4/21/2018 Trail is in good condition.  No problems as long as you are well conditioned, well prepared.  Trial is well marked with white blazes.  Wild flowers in bloom.  Saw a few deer.  Summit with scant snow in sections.  No special equipment needed today.  Water refill at ranger station.  Easy 2nd peak bag Miller Peak 10400’ right off the trail near the summit.  Look at your maps if you want some more peaks to play on.  Great day, great trail, just be prepared.', 'Want to start off by stating we were unable to hike to the peak, as the winds were blowing so hard it made it difficult to stand let alone hike, with that being said the skyline trail is all that it is advertised as, tough, strenuous, tiring and demanding. We started around 3ish with our headlamps blazing the path. We kept a sharp eye out for the painted circles on the rocks to help guid our path, even still we made a couple wrong turns, and we were watching for any snakes which have been reported in the past couple weeks. We stopped a couple times to takes in the views of Palm Springs at full darkness, pretty cool. We made it to the series of pick nick tables with out any problems, hacking was moderately difficult. Reached the rocks with the spray painted written mileage and no water for the remainder of the hick, continued up switchbacking up the side of a hill finding a great spot to watch the sunrise, awesome views, came across the first of two emergency boxes, then two our surprise, stumbled upon 3 dear, they kept their distance, but they did not run and hide also. Once you reach the picnic benches no more painted dots to guid your path. The next few mils was going up and over ridge lines, not bad hiking, saw our first view of the tram, the desert landscape is amazing, with bushes blooming flowers of all different colors, cactus blooming, lots of Cholla cactus close to trail head, be aware, lots of manzanita bushes and lots of yucca plants. Trail is moderate. Then the trail changes drastically, the major up hill accents starts, winding back and forth, definitely leg burner accents. We were in a manzanita Grove which felt like it would never end. The trail became more rocky for sure, pasted the second emergency box and what was called flat rock, not to impressed. The clouds started to come in and the wind began to pickup. By 7000ft, small snow flakes began to fall with the sun shining. I knew it was going to be a cold hike so, took a lot of warm clothing, and I used every bit of it, but I stayed warm.    The trail was becoming more rocky, and the snow falling made the rocks a bit slipper at times. The incline seemed to have increased, my legs were feeling tired and I was having to stopped periodically to catch my breath, the higher we rose wind seemed to be hitting stronger and the snow flakes were increasing at times. We stopped for a quick and her comes the 64 yr old lady, just the happiest person, I asked when she started, 2 hrs after us and she looked she could run up the trail, haha. I asked her how much further, she said about 20 min, yeah for it was, me it was more like 35 min.  By this point my legs felt like jelly, with the wind blowing and snowing I could not wait for the end, The trail at times became hard to read, lots of down limbs, scrambling over rocks, lots of switch backs and fairly steep at times. We finally crested the top, the snow had stopped but the wind was howling, put on the rest big my cold gear and headed to the tram, the worst part is climbing the concrete path to the tram. Went straight to the bar ordered a beer to celebrate our first cactus to clouds hike. After nearly 8 hrs I was tired, my legs acked, my feet were tired, but I would do it again in heart beat. Gear I took, 4.5 liters of fluid, one of those liters was Gatorade, a variety of snacks, emergency kit- matches, lighter, compus, knief, whistle, backup maps, first aid kit, small rope, clothing- gloves, Beanie, hat, Balaclava, windbreaker, plus the layers I had on, extra head lamp, hiking poles, charger for my phone. If you have any questions feel free to ask, thanks for reading, happy trails.', 'Intense! But worth it all the way.', 'Just finished. Started at 3 am. Hit the tram at 8 and the round trip back to the tram by 1pm. Some brief rest breaks included. It was adrenaline inducing to walk through the desert at night alone, quietly climbing. Around 3 miles in, I noticed a pair of big red eyes staring at me when I was scanning near the trail with my head lamp. It was a bear.about 15 feet off the trail just sitting and staring. I kept moving and it did not follow. No need for micro spikes or crampons. I did the entire push wearing only shorts but I carried full winter clothing just in case. Full moon. Great adventure best shared with a like minded acquaintance', 'I appreciate all of the information from the members on this site.  \nAny advice on traveling down the trail from the tram to the museum?  Any dangerously steep areas?', 'Great climb. Get up early and watch the sunrise over Palm Springs. Met a rattler 90 seconds.', 'Two friends and I decided to give the Cactus to Clouds a go during our time in Palm Springs.  Before we made the trip down we did a lot of research on the hike as we really wanted to be sure we knew what we were getting into and that we were prepared for the trail conditions (reviewing blogs www.sanjocjan.com, trail reviews, weather forecasts / conditions, local outdoor stores, correspondence with the ranger station). We downloaded ""The Hiking Guys"" GPX file as reference and the route / map were fairly consistent (with a few minor discrepancies).\n\nWe started at 4:00 on the Saturday morning and made our way up to the Tram by around 9:45.  Highlights for this section are definitely the views, rock formations and passing through 3 distinct climate zones.  We were rather surprised once we got to around mile 8.5-9 as we had expected the climb around Coffman\'s Crag to be this vertical wall (based on some reviews) but in general the pitch was a lot easier than we were anticipating.\n\nOnce we reached the tram we made sure to touch base with the Rangers with regards to trail conditions as well as any groups we had come across (some better prepared than others).  After filling our the park permit we proceeded on to the summit.  The trail from approx. 1 mile away from the Tram to the summit is a combination of ice (in the lower elevation) and soft snow at the summit.  Navigating the trail proved a little hard than earlier but the GPX file kept us pretty true to the general trail location.  The upper 2500\' in elevation is a good challenge (both mentally and physically) as the elevation effects everyone different. For me at around 9500\' I was feeling the effects (little nauseous and light headed) but we continued on and reached the summit around 1-1:30pm (what a spectacular view from the top...you truly feel like you are on top of the world).\n\nAfter hanging out on the summit for a few minutes (grabbing a few needed photos) we started the journey back to the tram (which is where the micro spikes and poles really came in handy).  We reached the ranger station / tram at around 3:40pm and handed out permits back in to the rangers...and then made our way to the bar to grab a well deserved pint (and Pepsi as I was LOW on sugar). \n\nThe views, different climate zones, local flora, fauna and everything else along the way was spectacular but what truly makes this hike so amazing is the journey with the friends.\n\nSidebar comment (and a very frustrating observation) is how many people we saw on the trail between the Tram and the Summit with no water, no protection for the elements (sweatshirt and tights), improper foot ware (gym shoes).  The weather was nice but up there it can change in an instant. I would say probably 70% of the people we saw on the trail were under prepared which puts the Rangers at risk everyday (on our way down we saw 3 Rangers heading up for a rescue as people couldn\'t descend in their shoes).  \n\nThe number one reason for rescues (as quoted by one of the Rangers) is ""People with their heads up their Ass"".   If you are going to try this hike (or any other hike) please respect the Mountain and the conditions.  We were lucky enough to have solid weather but were prepared for much worse.\n\nCactus to Clouds is a great trail and worth the adventure (but definitely not as physically challenging as we thought).', 'Skyline park was open did not attempt to summit', 'First weekend on November with clear skies. Christine and I started sharp at 1 am from the museum. Took us 16.5 hrs to reach the summit and back down to take Tram. Took a lunch break and refill water at ranger station. The trees and sign at summit had frost, but prefer that that hike up in 3-digit temperature. Long hikes like this one, I always try to do it on full moon (less stress on my vision to find path and avoiding rocks). Like many people mentioned, last part will test you mentally and physically. Moved some rocks and branches to mark trail were trail was not very clear. If possible, do the same to avoid getting people lost and the sake of local rescue personnel.', ""Very tough but very rewarding. The last quarter is quite steep and challenges your mental toughness. Aside from needing 2-3 litres of water, it is only worth the weight of bringing energy dense foods to minimize what you're lugging up the 8,000 plus vertical feet. For example: Carrots. Are. A. Bad. Idea."", 'I did this hike with Seth and John in November and while it was a wonderful day spent hiking in the sunshine I realized at about 5500 feet that I had completely underestimated the physical and mental requirements that this trek required. Let me advise potential hikers to do a few things before doing this trail: 1. do get more than 3 hours of sleep  2. instead of drinking beer until bedtime the night prior, drink water 3. do eat a hearty breakfast; do not only drink a large mug of black coffee with an excessive amount of coconut oil. 4.do bring snacks that are appetizing and delicious; do not bring a whole summer sausage and a block of sharp cheddar cheese that will inevitably become as warm as the desert you are hiking in. That being said, we started our quest in the early morning (2:30). If I remember correctly we started off at around 400 feet, only 10,000+ more to go guys! The early morning part of it was really cool and as we got higher in elevation we noticed to the lights of Palm springs dotting the desert floor and the grandeur of the mountain revealed itself as the sun slowly rose. San Jacinto is huge so appreciate its beauty but don\'t let it intimidate you. I remember at about 5500 feet the trail goes from very strenuous to ""what the f***"" as the grade takes a sharp turn upwards and it does not let up until you reach the ranger station. Hydration is key to this hike. Kudos to those who have done this hike in the summer. I brought 3 liters of water and was sucking air from my pack by the time we made it to the ranger station. Once we made it there we used about 30 minutes to refill water, and eat some grub. The families with young children, the elderly tourists, the teenagers in jeans and tennis shoes that may have taken the tram up to the ranger station did not seem to understand the pure exhaustion that was painted all over my face and in such a beautiful environment, I understood but I didn\'t let their bright, smiling faces get me down so we pressed onward toward the summit which at that point is still 5 or so miles away. The ranger station is really the only easy part of this hike and the remaining five miles are still very strenuous but the views along the entire route are awesome and a well-earned reward each step you make towards the top. Eventually we did it make it to the top, where Seth valiantly fought off some altitude sickness to have our picture taken by one of the many visitors that shared the peak with us that day. We spent about 30 minutes at the top before we began the 5 mile journey back to the visitor center where we reveled in our accomplishment over some cold grog that we found at the bar in the restaurant that is located inside of the visitor center. I don\'t remember exactly how long the entire hike took us but we estimated that we hiked from 2:30/3 a.m. to about 5 p.m. I highly recommend this hike but just prepare for it better than I did and you will be fine!', 'Did this in November. 3 am start time, lost the trail once or twice in the beginning but it gets more defined as you go up. The trail is not challenging, if there were snow on the route that would change things dramatically. That being said, the forecast called for clear sky’s but light flurry’s of snow did come in around 8:30 and went off and on throughout the day. From trail head to the top and back to the tram took us 13 hours.', 'Hardest day hike I have ever done!  I was not in the best of shape so it took 14.5 hours for me to summit.  I was cramping out towards the end of the first 8000 ft. I stretched out at the ranger station and gutted the rest of the hike out. I want to improve my time and do it again in October which is when we went in 2017.  I do not recommend doing it in the summer months. No water until the tram and I used every drop of the 4 liters I carried with me by the time I got there.', 'Awesome hike for the serious, well prepared only. Super steep, long, and treacherous at upper elevations with snow. Very challenging, very rewarding. Cold beers at the tram station are on me! Enjoy', 'This hike is brutally tough. The worst of it is all prior to Long Valley, but it doesn\'t get easy after that since your legs will feel like sludge from the Skyline Trail section. By starting early in the morning, like 2 or 3 AM early, you\'ll have the opportunity to view an incredible sun rise. Bring a head lamp and follow the white dots painted on the rocks, especially at the beginning of the hike. This is one hike I highly suggest using a GPS for. Download someone\'s confirmed gpx file for this and use that for a guide. There are several cutoff ""trails"" off the main drag of the Skyline Trail that will cause some confusion as to which trail to follow; stick to the white dots and follow the footprints while often checking your gps to confirm your path. Since most people start in pitch black, a map and compass doesn\'t offer much assistance.', '', 'This is by far the hike I am most proud of completing. I lost the Skyline Trail within a mile of Long Valley and spent an hour wandering around lost. I hiked overnight in August. Read as much as you can before the hike to prepare, and make sure you hike with others who are adequately prepared.', 'Started out @ 0600 got to the tram by 5. This was a very intense trail, let it be known I carried over 30lbs when I started out. Tip:Go light bring at-least 4L of water. Start early to enjoy the sunrise and kick some a$$!', ""I wouldn't say it's best used from March to October. But I'd say in late fall (when it's no longer hot and just before snow falls) and early spring (when snow has mostly melted at the top and before the desert heat comes back)."", 'Hiked this beast with 3 buddies on Veteran’s day this past weekend and wow what a humbling experience.  This hike is as intense as it gets no joke.  Went with an avid backpacker, an ex army paratrooper, my brother inlaw who hikes regularly and myself I exercise 3-5 x per week/hike regularly and we all agreed it was the toughest day challenge of our lives.  We did half dome in June in a day and this was like hiking up to half dome twice and back down once.  No training can prep you for this journey unless you spend all day training for iron man stuff.  C2C is actually over 21 miles not 18 as stated here.  It’s 10 miles from museum to Tram station (8000 feet elevation gain) and 5.5 more miles up to san Jacinto (2600 feet elevation gain) and 5.5 miles back to tram.  Once you are up a couple miles there is no turning back and you’ll be stuck in the desert until you climb to 8k feet elevation.   The first couple miles are steep but you’re fresh and will put them down no problem.  It doesn’t really get much easier going up through the desert and mile 8-10, after flat rock, you will be in for torture with the free for all steep grade scramble to the top.  Once you hit the top of skyline trail you will feel like you just climbed through hell to heaven.  The rest of the hike to San Jacinto was forgettable for me, pretty monotonous albeit with some solid views towards the top.  Perhaps i was just over not sleeping for almost 40 hours and hiking for 15+..  Unbelievably hard to continue on that final stretch after the skyline trail battle and with the altitude but we made it.  Views are incredible starting at night watching the city lights and night club sounds slowly fade below you, watching the sun rise from 6k or so feet over the city and the Salton Sea was absolutely amazing i swear you could hear a pin drop it was fantastic, and the landscape changes as you go from desert to mountain were remarkable.  Advice: Go in a group, take 5L of water and refill at tram station, do not hike in summer unless you have a death wish or like stepping next to snakes at night or taking breaks on rocks that snakes hide under, take two meals/snacks/salt tablets/energy gels, bring clothes to accommodate the weather changes as it’s like 20-30 degrees cooler in long valley and up Mt san Jacinto (having sweat drenched shirts when hiking in the cold is no bueno).  Hiking poles are an ABSOLUTE must too.  This is an insane journey and a bucket list item for the insane like myself.  Truly a day i will never forget the rest of my life.  Be prepared and go kick some ass!', ""It's amazing but you better be prepared for a loooong hike. When you see and hear the tram it's NOT over , it goes another 2 hours so just know mentally to keep treating till it evens out. Worth it but very hard because of the elevation which makes breathing hard and it never stops going up! Bring enough water and food. Not good if you have bad knees or if you are in bad shape. Again, prepare!"", 'There’s a reason why this is the 5th hardest day hike in the US. The first 8 miles are difficult, but definitely the last 2 miles before reaching the tram station take the life out of you, it has a very pronounced inclination and wears you out. After the tram station is really easy to go up since you only gain roughly 2000 ft elevation over 5.5 miles. We started hiking at midnight and we enjoyed the cool night temperatures of palm springs and had breakfast while enjoying the sunrise from ~6000ft elevation. In general it has beautiful views and you can see how the vegetation changes with the altitude gain. Bring a minimum of 6 lt of waters, plenty of snacks, protein bars, and 2 meals; also wear layers because the change in temperature between the base and the peak is pretty dramatic.', ""Great hike! And yes it's hard. The mileage from the museum parking to the tram is 15+ miles, not 11 as most sites say so be advised."", 'This trail will provide a memory that will last a life time. Completed in 1969 no GPS no rescue boxes, little water. only the will to complete. Thank God for a patch of snow to provide energy to make it. Be prepared and stay strong.', 'Starting at 330 to try and clear most of the low desert before sunrise was key to a successful C2C for my group. Trail is easy to follow for the first ~2m, but after that we relied heavily on our GPS to guide us back to the trail until the sun came up. The final push at Grubb’s Notch on the Skyline Trail is as tough as it is exhilarating. The trip from the tram to the peak is not very difficult, but after Skyline, it felt like it was never going to end! Drank 3L on Skyline and 2L during the the hike up from the Ranger Station. We hiked for just over 15h and enjoyed most of it. :)', ""3:15 am start.  Carrying 6 liters of water, no food.  Have been training without consuming any calories during my hikes on the Bear Canyon Trail of Mt Baldy, and I wanted to see if I could do it for C2C.\n\nI should have ditched 3 liters of water to make the ascent to Grubbs Notch easier.  That last 2 miles is grueling and the extra weight only makes it worse.  Took 6.5 hours to reach Grubbs Notch and begin the 2nd phase to Mt. San Jacinto.\n\nThere is a water-refill at the Ranger Station.  Make sure you register because a ranger was coming down the trail and checking people to ensure they carried their receipts on their person.\n\nThe trek through Long Valley up to the summit is no picnic, but it feels like a leisurely stroll compared to the Skyline Trail.  9.5 hours over 16 miles, 10,250 ft. climb to the summit.  12.5 hours to complete the 21 mile total for return trip to the tram.  Next time I'll carry less weight and improve the time.  Be prepared to wait up to an hour in line before you could board the tram down for the descent.  I was not able to get reception on my iPhone 7, nor was I able to connect to their WiFi so coordinate with others knowing that you might not be able to communicate.  Plan ahead.\n\nI highly recommend using Iron Mountain and the Bear Canyon Trail of Mt Baldy as your training hikes to prepare for this beast.  And minimize the weight you carry!\n\nI consumed 3.25 liters of water, only.  No food or energy drinks.  I highly recommend experimenting with using fasting to induce ketosis as your source of energy.  Less weight to carry, lower water consumption, no stops for chow.  For comparison, I am 6 ft. tall and 165 lbs., 58 years old."", 'An amazing trail! Come prepared fitness wise as it is very challenging. Come prepared with enough fluids and food. Be patient as it’s a long day of hiking. One of my favorite hikes I have ever done.', ""Loved this hike. beautiful time of year to hike it.  We left at 4:15 AM and I'm glad I had the GPX tracker as we lost the trail several times.  Made it to San Jacinto peak at 1 pm and down to the tram by 4. It was hard but not as bad as the reviews make it out to be. Great experience."", 'Almost a week later and I still cannot believe I completed the infamous ""Cactus to Clouds"" hike in Palm Springs. Rated the ""Fifth Most Difficult Day Hike in the United States"" by Backpacker Magazine, the hike starts on the desert floor of Palm Springs (near the cactus) and gains thousands of feet of elevation leading to San Jacinto Peak (up in the clouds). I woke up at 1:00am Sunday morning (10/15) to meet at my carpool spot by 2:00am. Kiyomi, Jessy, and I headed to Palm Springs and arrived in time for our 4:15am start. Sure it may have been pitch dark but with the desert sun, it heats up quickly and we had to climb as much as possible before the sun would start scorching us. One of my fellow WTC students, Charles, arranged the hike and although I had been incredibly hesitant I decided to give it a go. After all, I thought I was going to stop once we arrived at the top of the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway.  So at 4:15am we started the ascent and there was no turning back. Literally, no turning back... Once you start on the Skyline Trail portion of C2C, you are committed to climbing 8,000+ feet in ~9 miles. Turning around is simply not an option as you would descend into an inferno otherwise known as the desert heat.  The Skyline portion was not terrible until the sun started heating up the exposed trail. I was carrying three liters of water and a 32 ounce Gatorade and reached the tram with about half a liter of water to spare. Water is not available until you complete the Skyline Trail (arrive at the tram). I was thankful for all the snacks I brought - especially the bananas which I am certain helped avoid cramping. Our group of seven reached the tram around noon (we took a lot of breaks) and enjoyed a break while eating lunch. I felt like I could make the push for the peak - another 5 miles and ~2,500 feet of gain + 5 miles back - so myself and five others departed the tram and headed for the peak. My body started feeling it about two miles from the peak. But, with great determination I continued on. After all, I hadn\'t hiked ~12/13 miles just to turn around two miles from the destination. Four of us reached the peak. I was overcome with joy as I scrambled up the rocks and caught sight of the ""Mt. San Jacinto Peak"" sign at about 4:30pm.   ""Set your goals high and don\'t stop till you get there."" Well, I followed this quote and reached the summit. Unfortunately, what goes up must come down. The trek back to the tram was exhausting - both mentally and physically. My feet were aching, my muscles were sore, and the sun was setting faster than we were descending. It was time to put the headlamp back on; we started the hike with it and we finished with it as well. Reaching the tram around 7:00pm, I had never been so happy to end a hike (and that\'s saying something!!) We waited for the rest of the group, took the tram down, hopped in an Uber, and returned to the Palm Springs Art Museum where we had left the car 14+ hours before.  My Fitbit said I walked/hiked more than 68,900 steps/28.4 miles on Sunday - more than most people walk in an entire week. It was exhausting and I seriously contemplated calling in sick to work yesterday as my body felt like it was ran over by a semi truck but I did it. I completed the ""Fifth Most Difficult Hike"" in the entire United States. I had hiked from the Cactus to the Clouds. I completed the trek to San Jacinto\'s boulder-strewn crown in such a way that is only 800 vertical feet shorter than the climb from Everest basecamp to the summit and comparable to doing more than a thousand flights of stairs. This hike was no joke and everyone even thinking about attempting it should do their homework and check it twice.', '10/21/2017 grueling but rewarding trail. Do your research, there are many great resources online. Let me say that again: do your research, and check out the incredible resources that are online for free. Unfortunately I did not stop to enjoy the scenery through the pain...\nStarted at 1 am, got to the tram area by 9 am, summitted just before 1 pm, got back to the tram just before 5. Surprisingly, I had pretty consistent cell service (AT&T fwiw) all the way to the tram. I hiked solo but I (correctly) suspected that there would be others hiking that day; I saw two other cars of hikers in the parking lot and one other solo hiker. Took just under 6L of fluids with me, which turned out to be far too much since I was quite chilly on the skyline trail, and I only drank about 3L of fluids on that stretch. It was my first time hiking in the dark and I forgot that I\'m scared of the dark...would not recommend but I made it through. Again, it was reassuring that I knew that there were others on the trail 10-30 min behind me, since I lost the trail a few times, and once I lost it quite badly. I use AllTrails for GPS nav, but I\'m sure that there are other great apps and gadgets out there. Timing wise, I passed Rescue 2 before dawn and hit Flat Rock around dawn. \nLeaving the tram area, I felt pretty great, since I was open to stopping at the tram if need be. By the time I got to the divide, I was still feeling fine but hiking slowly. The last two miles to the summit and the descent were hell. I was completely exhausted and starting to feel the effects of elevation, which made it feel worse than even the ascent to Grubb\'s Notch. I descended at about the same pace that I was hiking uphill, and I had to stop for a nap at the divide on the way down. I definitely was having a bit of a temper tantrum because I was in a lot of pain, so kudos to my boyfriend for being patient and very encouraging.\nAs preparation for the hike, I had been doing some big hikes all through the summer, and this was the last peak in the ""SoCal Six Pack"" for me this year. I had done Gorgonio via Vivian Creek about a month prior, and hadn\'t been at elevation since then. Admittedly, I did not prepare as much as I could have in that month leading up to the hike, but I did stick to a workout regimen the week before (Friday: squats 3 sets of 10 reps at 135#, 1 set of 20 reps at 135#, Saturday: 3.5 mi run, Sunday: 100 body-weight squats, Monday: rock climb and run, Tuesday: 3.5 mi run, Friday: 1 mi light run). I was only sore for about a day afterwards; my calves were the sorest but my quads looked amazing haha. The last caveat is that I am in my 20s so a short lead up and quick recovery are privileges that I understand I will probably not enjoy for too much longer. If you build up those muscles and prepare yourself (especially mentally!), you can do it!', 'Amazing hike. Started at 0300 and we were at the summit and back to the tram in 13.5 hours.', ""Be Prepared!!! We started the hike at 1.30 am and finished at 3pm... we did take a long break at the tram station after completing the Skyline trail before going up to the summit. But its a long day.\n\nSkyline trail (from the desert floor to the tram station) is practically straight up for about 6 hours the last mile or 2 is the worst as you are already tired and it just gets steeper. It is also quite easy to lose the trail so you really have to pay attention to the white dots painted on the rocks and notice the stones on the ground trying to block off a certain path. \n\nI would have been happy to stop at the tram station but we ended up summiting so we could complete the Cactus to Cloud trail. The last 2 miles back down to the tram were never ending. I'm glad I did it but don't think I would want to again (not for a long while anyways) \n\nIf you are planning on doing this hike make sure you can handle hours of steep elevation and know it will be a very long day -  then you should be good. Happy Hiking!"", 'An adventure for a lifetime. It was a very difficult and long hike. Hikers should be mentally and physically prepared. I’ll do it again someday!!!!!', 'Got lost at the very start was not a good sign even with headlamps. At sunrise it was spectacular views of Palm Springs. Drunk lots of water.', 'The Mountain Beckons:\nCactus-to-Clouds hike is considered one of the hardest day-hikes in America. The route to the top covers 16 miles one-way, with over 10,000 ft. of elevation gain, rising from the desert floor of Palm Springs and reaching San Jacinto Peak at 10,834 ft. The route is a combination of certain trails, starting with the short Museum trail for about 1 mile, continuing up the unmaintained Skyline trail for nearly 10 miles, followed by a 6 miles well-maintained trail to the peak. The extreme climate change, from the blistering heat of the desert where temperatures can top 120 degrees, to the frigid reaches of the peak, poses its own unique challenges. The hike can be attempted only during certain time of the year where one must factor the heat and the snow at both ends.\nAn aerial tramway takes visitors from Valley Station at 2643 ft. to Mountain Station at 8516 ft. This provided an easy way down on the way back from the peak. The last tram leaves Mountain Station at 9:45 PM so that is the hard deadline to finish the hike. We later found out that the tramway closes for annual maintenance during September and can have a delayed opening in October. Non-expert hikers start their hikes from Mountain Station instead of the Museum trailhead, as there is no water to be found on the Skyline trail and turning back would mean descending into the hot desert.\nI had done the hike to Mt. Whitney with my brother a few years ago, so we were eager for new challenges. We contemplated doing the Cactus-to-Clouds hike in the first weekend in October which was close to a full-moon night. Our plan was to start our hike in the night, which would give us some respite from the heat as we climb up and reach the snow-free peak by the afternoon. Then we would take the tram on our way back, ending the 22 miles long hike.\nSo, we flew into Palm Springs on Friday, Oct 6th by late morning, when the temperature was already hovering at 90 degrees! After picking up our rental car and stopping for lunch, we headed to Palm Springs Art Museum trailhead to scope out the place. Then we went to Palm Springs Visitors Center to get some information about the route and the tram. We talked to some helpful agents who shared their experience of hiking on that stretch. Then we proceeded to Valley Station which was a steep 3.8-mile drive. After looking at the lay of the surroundings, we headed to our hotel where we checked-in around 3 PM.\nWe decided to catch a few hours of sleep before we would start the hike at 9:45 PM. That would give us a 24 hrs. window to complete the hike. We only managed a couple of hours of sleep before we got up and headed to a neighborhood Walmart to purchase food and water for the hike. Back at the hotel, we took another short nap after which we drove to the trailhead. We parked our car in a free garage opposite the Art Museum, and precisely at 9:45 PM started our hike by turning on our headlamps. The temperature at that time was 80 degrees.\nThe trail from Museum trailhead starts climbing immediately and it seemed to climb for ever and ever. We looked for the white dots on rocks to follow the trail that we had read about. It was confusing at times as there were multiple trails going up but we followed the most widely used trail. Once, we reached a cliff-side and realized we were on the wrong trail and backtracked only to find ourselves heading downhill. Fortunately, that was the correct trail as we found some signs marking the trail. Some of the side trails had been cordoned off with small rocks and twigs by other helpful hikers since there is no official trail here.\nAfter hiking for nearly a mile we reached some picnic tables where we stopped for a short break to catch our breaths. The city lights down below were shimmering in the heat of the desert and we could hear all sorts of sounds of the city. This stretch of the hike should have given us a good idea of what to expect ahead. This would be a good turnaround point. But we pressed on, knowing we had the cover of the night to escape the desert heat. Initially, there was no breeze but as we continued climbing up we felt some light breeze which was refreshing.\nDrinking water from our Camelbaks, we kept on going, and soon crossed a trail junction which put us on the Skyline trail. The next milestone for us was the 1st Rescue box where food and water is stored for hikers in distress. The light breeze had turned into a steady wind but it still felt good. With heavy eyelids, we kept on climbing up, making sure we stayed on the trail while avoiding brushing against cactus and other thorny plants. At one point, I ended up going in the wrong direction and took a tumble while backtracking. That woke me up and I stayed alert for any wrong turns. Many times, we checked our progress on Alltrails to make sure we didn’t drift away from the main trail. \nWe had not come across any other hikers so far but around 2:30 AM we were overtaken by a solo hiker with small backpack a', ""I really appreciated everyone's reviews before I took on this hike. They are accurate when saying this is tough and you have to start early.  I know a few people that have done the complete trail in 6-9hrs, but if you're like me, and you like to stop for pictures, and food, expect to take anywhere from 10-12hrs.  The first 4000ft. are tough, but the last 3000+ ft before you get to long valley are sooo much more tough.  This is not for the faint of heart, or people that are not willing to climb a few boulders haha.  I stopped at the tram station because it was cold and rainy, and I left my rain poncho at home that day, but I still feel victorious.  I've done the hike to the summit a few times from the tram so I can say this... The last 2000ft to the summit are bearable and most enjoyable, especially if you take a little pause at Wellman's Divide for pictures and a little snack.There's nothing like that feeling of accomplishment when you've reached your destination, no matter how hard the journey is.  Can't wait to do this again!"", ""I have read many reviews that describe this as a hike to do for the challenge, but not for the beauty. Many call it ugly with a lack a scenery. I completely disagree. This was the most beautiful hike I have taken yet because it goes through every aspect of southern California. It was an absolutely amazing day for me from the first step in Palm Springs where nothing can grow, to a few small cacti about a mile in, to larger cacti, to small shrubs, to large shrubs. Then around 5000 feet, a few 10ft desert trees, then a couple of tunnels through the trees. At about 7000 feet, I crossed the first pine, then surrounded by pines, then into that glorious meadow of grass and pines, up the mountain to the boulders and chilly air at the peak. It was incredible to walk through it all in one day. Here is the standard warning - DO NOT DO THIS UNLESS YOU ARE EXPERIENCED!!\n\n For preparation, I hiked all minor peaks in San Diego (Woodson, Iron Mtn, El Cajon, Cowles man - plus the other 4 in the park, etc...), then I hit the LA and San Bernardino mountains (Gorgonio, Baldy, Cucamonga, Ontario, San Jacinto from Idyllwild). The best prep for this was Mt Baldy on the Bear Creek Trail. If you don't know what it's like to hike 6000ft in 6 miles, then don't try this. After that, I did a 20 mile hike in temps ranging from 100 down to 80, back up to 100 on the decent. If you don't know what it's like to hike in heat, don't try this!! \n\nSupplies - I brought 6.3 liters of water (including 1 small bottle of gatorade to celebrate at Longs Valley) and drank all of it in the first 10 miles. I then refilled 4 liters of h20 at the ranger station and drank 3. I consumed 2 bananas, 3 cliff bars, 2 pb&js, 1 bag trail mix, 1 bag beef jerky. I had zero cramps and zero altitude issues which I credit to advil and salt tabs. I eat 1 salt capsule every hour during the strenuous times, then 2 advil every hour over 5000 feet to combat the swelling brain. ?Doesn't salt dehydrate you? - You sweat out salt and need to replace it to keep your body in balance (electrolytes). \n\nHighlights - Saw a herd a bighorn sheep about 2 miles up. They were only 100 feet from me and scared the hell out of me originally. It was still dark and I saw only their green glowing eyes. I first thought it was a couple mountain lions and pulled my spray out (and released the safety for the first time). Then I saw many more eyes and heard hooves. It was really amazing. Sunrise was breathtaking. Miles 8-10 are torture. standard hiking uphill is 600ft/mile gain. Very difficult is 1000ft/mile. The last 2 miles before the valley are 1250ft/mile. Reaching Long Valley is the real accomplishment here. Oddly, I was greeted by 4 elderly women who appeared to be dressed for a polo match. When I cleared the top, I saw a hundred non-exhausted casual strollers wandering around the valley and felt like I was in the twilight zone. After a short celebration, I realized 11 miles still awaited me.\n\n From the valley to the top is a cakewalk though, compared to the original beast played. It's like an 11 mile victory lap. Plenty of deer around, so keep your eyes open and camera ready. Beware of the killer attack squirrels. One guy actually did have to kick a squirrel off of him. Views from the top are amazing. \n\nTimeline - 4:15am start. 83 degrees. 6:45 sunrise. I was at 3000 feet. 80 degrees 9:45 - I was at 6000 feet preparing for the brutal 2 miles ahead. 12:15 - at the valley 4:15 - summit. 60 degrees 7:00 - tram for beers/burger. \n\nNote - I brought 2 shirts and kept changing them out every 2 hours. Soaked through them very quickly. Also brought 2 socks to swap out along the way. Keep your feet dry!! \n\nanother note - Alltrails seems to be about 20% off on their distance calculations. I have used multiple apps on various hikes/rides as well as gauged this against know distances. It's just off. This is a 21 mile hike, not 16.7."", ""It's a great hike with great views! What a workout! This is good training for Whitney or The Mt. Whitney climb will prepare you for this!"", ""Who's done Whitney in a day and how does this compare?"", 'I want to put this on here so that you can plan your trip accordingly. The Palm Springs Aerial Tramway will be closed for annual maintenance Sept. 11 - Sept. 30, 2017 with a tentative reopening date of Oct. 1, 2017.  During this time, you will not have a tram car to take you to the valley floor, so you will have to hike back down on your own.  I recommend that you do not do this hike during this time period.', ""This trail is amazing, but do be careful.  I did the trek Thursday 8/17/17. I brought 4 proteins bars, 3 bananas, 70 ounces of water in camel back and 60 ounces of Gatorade in bottle (Colleague of my wife did the hike a few years ago and encountered solo hiker at mile 7 whose camel back had leaked out and group had to spare water) so I was spooked.  I left, despite everyone's warning, at 6am.  Several people said that I needed to get to 3,000ft as quick as possible to avoid the desert heat, so ran/hike the first two miles.  The trail markings after mile 1 at times were nonexistent.  I got lost at mile 2.3 about 20 minutes but luckily the ALLTRAILS app saved my butt.  MapMyRun couldn't triangulate my gps coordinates and I was going to have to turn around, but low and behold AllTrails app maps was able to load and showed me right where I was; I had made a left instead of a right!!! Once back on course I began to jog/ brisk walk the next mile.  At that point I had climbed enough elevation and the weather from there on out was very pleasant.  After mile 7 the nature of the hike begins to change.  It's steep and the air is thinner. I thought the trail was 10 miles, so I saved up a ton of energy and was going to jog the last mile.  At mile 9 I began to jog and at 9.22 both legs cramped on the inner thigh from knee to groin. That stopped me dead in my tracks, but it was weirdest thing because I had saved all this energy and then had to awkwardly limp hike the rest of the way.  My dreams of a sub five hour trek were over.  The last two miles were magical, but challenging.  They ended up taking 2.5 hours, but it was so much fun. 7.5 hour finish.*** I did this trek solo under perfect weather conditions and it was challenging. I'm a pretty avid trail runner and had been seriously training for this for two months.  I spoke with rangers after I finished and they were quite vocal about how dangerous that trail was, especially solo.  This trail is majestic and pretty, but it's no joke.  If your planning to do this take the warnings to heart! ***Cramps stink, I still have them a day and half later, but it was so WORTH IT!"", 'Did this on Aug 5 2017. Started at 1:30 am. Did it as a C2C2C that is from museum to San Jacinto peak and back to museum. It was hot when I started (90F) and hot when I returned (105F). Note that at the start once you are up 3 miles or about 3000 ft the temperatures are nice. I consumed about 6L water (electrolyte enhanced with Mg/Ca/K/Na + lime juice) the whole R/T. While coming down the last 5 miles are hot but bearable as there was some breeze and the mountain offers some shade. I did buy a perfume bottle for a dollar from the dollar store, filled it with water and used it as a mister - worked great for the last 5 miles on the way back.', 'Amazing , tough but worth it. Prepare for it', ""Absolutely incredible feat. Hardest thing I've ever done, and maybe my proudest accomplishment. I'm a desert local and would warn you, though -- take the heat seriously! The high in Palm Springs was 95 the day we hiked, plus we started at 4am, and I was still near the upper limit of how hot I'd want to be. Pack more water and than you think you need. But if you're in shape and prepared, give it a shot. You'll be glad you did."", ""very nice run out of water by the bench. I'll conquered the summit by November."", ""DO NOT TRY THIS HIKE UNLESS YOU ARE IN BALLER SHAPE! If you can't comfortably run a marathon or jog all of mt baldy, this is dangerous and is not with the helicopter rescue. Also, do not do this hike during the day. The heat will melt you and make it miserable. My experience: got to the museum around 5pm, left immediately. It was 111 degrees when we started. Had about 40 lbs on me, about 6 liters of water, snacks, some other random stuff. Around 8 pm it cooled down and became awesome. The moonlight guided us the entire way. Managed to slam the first 8,000 ft of elevation gain by about 1am. The trail is easy to follow. It was 33 degrees up there, and windy. Took a little nap at the ranger station, and at 3am cruised up to the peak. Watched sunrise from the summit, words can't explain! There is a reason John Muir calls the 'the most spectacular view god gave to man', and he calls everyone out from the grave by saying 'you aren't a mountaineer if you haven't done the cactus to clouds trail...'. You really can't appreciate this hike unless you start from the bottom. It was incredible watching the lights of Palm Springs slowly fade into the distance while grinding through the night. My feet got some gnarly blisters but beyond that our legs were pretty happy so we did the entire hike back down. Total distance, over 35 miles, total net elevation gain, nearly 25,000 ft according to my watch. Took about 17 hours of hiking, plus a nap and a nap at the peak. I didn't take any breaks going up or down and I suggest you don't either, keep your momentum going. Result: a special accomplishment and sense of pride knowing you did the 'hardest/most elevation gain day hike in America'. And some gnarly blisters. Body feels great though. Being 21 kicks ass sometimes. Advice: DO NOT try to do cactus to clouds to cactus if you aren't into suffering a little. Take the tram down and enjoy. Also if you do take the tram down, arrange some ride from the tram to the museum. Also, don't be a Judas and raid the emergency boxes... don't even try this if you're gonna rely upon those boxes. Carry your own water and suck it up if you get thirsty. Thirsty is not an emergency. Also, again, DO THIS OVERNIGHT. It's amazing! And protect your skin. 6 liters of water should be enough just hydrate before. And no matter what, you're gonna blister, so suck up the pain and smile, and enjoy a badass hike. And leave your phone at home, pictures won't do it justice and you can't enjoy the summit without doing the hike so just be free and off the grid and enjoy. Good luck!"", ""Cactus to Clouds will undoubtedly be the most difficult trail that most day hikers will ever undertake.  The relentless vertical gain cannot be fully appreciated until it's attempted.  The crux of this hike will be from around Rescue 2 to the tram, where you've already climbed about the equivalent of a vertical mile, but are still around 3,000 feet below the tram.  Rest and food can be had at the tram, but if you don't succumb to the temptation of riding it down and calling it a day, you're still nearly 2,000 ft short of your goal, and you're feeling the altitude now.  Descending that same vertical back down to the tram after summiting will reiterate how challenging descents can really be when you're tired.There is no way to prepare for C2C beyond doing hikes of equal vertical, which are few and far between.  It easily rivals Whitney in a Day, and many will debate which reigns supreme.  Anyone who doesn't do serious daily vertical as a matter of routine will struggle heavily with this hike, that's a promise.  Nothing from the bottom to the tram is particularly pretty, other than the city lights, and climbing San Jacinto from Idyllwild or from the top of the tram after riding it are far more sensible and enjoyable experiences.  Nonetheless, of you want to claim that you've undertaken the most difficult day hike in America, you'll need to complete this and Whitney in a Day to have a leg to stand on.  Although standing up after either will not be guaranteed."", 'This Is The Best Hike Ever...45 Minutes At The Peak  ""Definitely Worth It"" I Love This Trail...( make sure to have a compass, map, flash light, protein bars and plenty of water) one more thing LISTEN TO THE RANGER', ""Difficult, and not just because the vert, but also because the training dayhikes, like, Telescope, Iron, Grand Canyon, Villager and others, were far, FAR, more beautiful and rewarding.

Yes, there were some flowering Yucca and a few other flowers, but in general, it was just a relentless, beige, hot, exposed death slog. Started around midnight. consumed 4 liters of H2O.

Departed at 0715 and made it to the steep frozen snow slope just below the tram station. Hikers just ahead had tried to cross and scared themselves badly. Could probably have found a route around, but one of our group was ill and unsteady on their feet. Made an about face, returning to the trailhead at 0745. A strenuous day for sure. Snow may not be an issue in a few days, but right now you should carry crampons and/or ice axe and know how to use them in order to safely negotiate the last ~0.5 mile.', ""I read the information at the trail head and saw that this was a trail for intermediate-advanced hikers. I'm almost intermediate (hiked about 4 trails novice-intermediate prior) and I pushed myself for a total of 1.2 miles In and Out. Not much I know but it was a tedious trail on Skyline with some shifting shale and rocks going up an incline. I enjoyed the views over my new city and the wild flowers are in bloom. Abundance of different fragrances to entice your nose. I pushed myself to the top of the .5miles up and relished in my inactive bodies strains and pains...one small mountain at a time.

The 2-3 miles before Long Valley are covered in significant snow. I'm not sure I was on the correct trail, followed footprints which involved some serious scrambling, very steep ice/snow sections.  Crampons are a must, along with good trekking poles and gloves.\n\nEdit: I now realize I ascended Notch 1 rather than the correct trail. Be careful following the footprints and stick to your GPS."", 'Great view of the valley. Trail head is easy to access from downtown Palm Springs.

This time early January, was quite snowy near the tram and just below Grubbs Notch so we stopped at the tram (9 miles from Ramon Rd trailhead in Palm Springs)and decended, plus there is not enough daylight in the winter to do the complete trail even if snow levels allow.    Wild flowers in late March and early April are great. The last two miles before the tram are very steep and count on your progress slowing by half here. Wouldn't recommend for casual hikers."", 'I only went part way, great work out for the legs. a fun steep path that was dirt with rocks along the edges. great view. going to hike it further tomorrow.', ""Well it isn't easy, that's for sure.  Start early, bring water and a headlamp, and be prepared for huge temperature swings.  This is an epic hike and typically and all day affair.  The combination of length and elevation gain in this hike make it a real will tester.  There are harder hikes, but this one is up there."", ""I did this hike with my gf on 11/11/16.  We did a bit of the hike the day before, up to 1400 ft, which helped get our bearings straight.  We left from the museum trail head at 2:15am.  We took plenty of water (6L each) and I drank 4.5 L by the time we reached the tram/ranger station (11:45am) (we both refilled there).  The final ascent to the summit isn't bad at all (as far as steepness/grade is concerned); but after the long day, we were a bit beat.  We left the ranger station at 12:30pm and got to the summit at 3:30pm.  We didn't stay at the summit long, just long enough to take 5-10 photos.  We reached the tram/ranger station at 6pm.  It was a very strenuous and long day, but the overall experience and sense of accomplish upon reaching the summit = well worth the effort.  I would recommend buying souvenirs from the shop upon first arriving to the tram/ranger station...as the shop closes at approx 5pm.  All in all, this is a great hike.  Make sure you are training to do this, or at least are in great shape.  It's not a hike to underestimate.  Supplies: GPS watch, headlamps, hiking poles, electrolytes, Gu, Turkey jerky, PB&J sandwich, mad water in a camelback.  Make sure you have food that you can eat while up there.  I tend not to like large heavy meals while hiking, and tend to get fuel from things like Gu and jersey etc...as opposed to a hoagie.  Find what works for you."", ""I hiked this as my first hike/climb in California. It was not too hard but then again I do hike at least twice a week. We started at midnight and finished at 7pm . You gotta be prepared for a long day but just know this is a great trail, great views throughout the way, great workout too. Bring enough water to take you all the way to the ranger station at about 8,000 elevation by the tram station. At ranger station you can refill your water and you may want to buy your souvenirs too. I made the mistake of not buying and wanted to wait until after my return from Summit if Mt San Jacinto. The store was closed by the time we got back, they close at 5'sh. Bring a good camera too. There's amazing views at the top."", ""Like others have said, this hike is no joke. I wouldn't attempt it unless you've prepared significantly for it - i.e., you have been hiking for months and are fit. It took us around 17 hours (much longer than expected) because we had different levels of physical fitness in our group. \n\nMy takeaways from this hike:\n- it's take mental toughness to get through some long stretches of the skyline trail, mainly between mile 5 and Long Valley, but the sense of accomplishment when you summit is SO worth it!\n- even if it's not hot, you will sweat a lot. Consider that when deciding which layers to take with you. I had to take my shirt off to at certain times because I was shivering from the wind hitting my soaked shirt. The hottest it got when we did this hike this past week was around 75 degrees, but considering how much physical exertion this hike requires, chances are you'll be sweating a lot.\n- pack electrolytes because you'll be losing much salt from the sweating.\n- I went through a gallon of water for the skyline portion of the trail, then about a half gallon more after Long Valley (refilled at the ranger station) \n- it's better to overestimate how long it'll take you that way you do not chance missing the tram. We had to take more breaks than expected because it took some in our group to get used to the altitude.\n- the trail back to the tram from the peak can be a bit easy to get off of, pay extra attention especially if you're returning at night.\n\nThis hike was definitely a bucket list type of hike for me and only recommend it for those who are absolutely committed to it and have some serious motivation to do it. \n\nHappy hiking!"", 'I completed a partial recon hike during daylight hours just to become familiar with the trail prior to hiking it on the 23rd. I stepped off at about 0700, it was already almost 80 degrees. I hiked up 4 miles just a bit short of the 4300ft marker. I had a map that showed distances to specific markers on the trail. I found that none of the distances on the map matched my GPS. For example, Rescue 1 is marked as being 2.1 miles. My GPS had it at 2.6. Based on the time it took to get to it, I am inclined to say that the GPS has the correct distance.  It got hot really quickly and the heat (up 95) took its toll during my 8 mile out and back. There were more people on the trail than I expected. Most of them just hiking in a short distance, and others doing some trail running. Neither going up to the top. If you attempt to hike this make certain you are prepared and you start early. We are starting at 0315, next week.', 'What an awesome challenge! You must be in shape and experienced before attempting this hike. If you have never hiked this trail before, I strongly recommend doing a daylight pre-hike first. I hike the first four miles up the week before our Sunday hike, just so I could become a little familiar with the trail prior to starting off in the dark at 0315 Sunday. It is pretty easy to get turned around on the trail. Especially in the dark. Our starting weather was perfect. About 70/75 degrees. The temps went up a little, but by the time we were at 6000ft, we had easily beaten the heat of the desert and the temps started going down. When we made it to the peak it was raining, the winds were about 30/35mph and the temps were around 35 degrees with the wind chill factor. Make sure you have a map and compass, and a GPS tracking device. There were about three or four other groups doing C2C today as well. We played leap frog with one of them most of the way up. I took 6 liters of water and was down to my last half liter when we finished. I also used electrolyte tablets twice during the hike.', 'If you are up for a challenging hike this is a good one.  I really enjoined it, great views.', ""If you like a challenge hike and would like a good workout then this day hike is for you. Two friends and I hiked the C2C2C.  The tram was down for maintenance until the end of September so we did the complete 30-31 miles up to the peak and back down the same route and had a great time.  As others have mentioned:1.  Be physically prepared.  If you plan to take the tram down then it is less risky but if no tram, it is going to be a long day.  We started at 3:20AM, and made it back to the museum at about 7:15 PM, just as the sun came down.  We purposely waited and timed the sun so we end the day at sunset to avoid the heat as much as possible.  I have done multiple same day 10,000 ft climb and descents the past month before attempting this hike and did a Mt Rainier summit several days before our hike.  All I am saying is to complete something similar before doing this hike.2.  Have plenty of water.  Minimum of 4 liters but 5 to be safe. You can always stash them for others if you don't use them.3.  Have GPS.  You can go off trail in the dark if you don't have GPS.  Though trails are easy to find during the day but at night it's harder, especially when others have created many small paths that goes off to the side of the trails over the years. Many of the side trails you will discover during day lights they are good short cuts to the switchbacks.  4.If you do this along have a PLB.  You will lose cellular phone signals along the way up.  You will get signal at SJ peak.5.  Have fun!"", 'Good challenging hike. Steady uphill all the way to the tram. This is a good training hike for Mt Whitney and Rim2Rim2Rim Grand Canyon.', 'Fully understand what you are attempting here.  This is not for beginners and quite difficult. Prepare for possible significant temperature changes from bottom to top and extremely steep grades throughout. This hike affords little respite from the relentless trek to the summit. If you make it to the tram the rest of the hike seems like cake.   I went thru 6 liters of water on this hike in mid June. The views are not spectacular for the difficulty of the hike but if you leave early enough you catch a beautiful Palm Springs all lit up.', ""Sorry, but this wasn't the hardest hike I've ever done and the scenery was most certainly not the highlight. It's just a trudge uphill with views of Palm Springs, and I don't like cities. Once we got to the mountain part of the hike, I was much happier. The cactus-to-crowds portion is just something you do to say you've done it."", ""Amazing hike! Start no later than 3am, and bring lots of food and water.

Essentially staying on any well worn trail will get you to the tram. Still a fair amount of snow, though easily do able with poles or microspikes. I foolishly left my microspikes at home and it was a bit slippery at times on the snowpack. For people planning supplies, I had a 3L camelback, which I refilled at the tram. Used all of my water both times, and it was just enough. Ate about 1500 calories in snacks and would have appreciated a small bit more. It was very windy when I went up with wind advisory and 50mph gusts, though this seemed to be not the usual and known from the weather report. \n    My one caveat, beware of the trails above Long Valley. They are not marked and in the deeper snow areas, you can lose them for short stretches.   \n     Also, big thanks to the kind folks who work at the tram, the nice cleaning man who let me in before it opened in the morning to refill water, and huge shout out to the woman in her 70's who does the Skyline from the museum to the tram weekly.

After a few wrong turns we made it to the painted rock which is where the trail really starts. Next morning, we started at 4:30 am and had no trouble finding our way.  We witnessed the most incredible sunrise on the way up  and made it to the ranger's station in 5 1/2 hours flat.  The last climb up to and past Coffman's Crag really kicked my butt!  Took a half hour break to eat then continued on to the summit.  Still quite a lot of snow along the trail but, thanks to our trekking poles, we managed fine without micro spikes. My legs were screaming at me every time we had to climb and I had to stop and rest quite often to catch my breath.  Felt the altitude a few times (lightheaded and a little dizzy) but it passed after a few minutes.  Reached the summit at about 1:45 and made it back in time to catch the 4:30 tram down.  It was mind boggling to see what we had just climbed up! Caught a cab to the museum and headed to In n Out for the best tasting, completely guilt-free, Animal-style cheeseburger I've ever had (according to my Polar, I burned over 5,000 calories in a single day!).This is not a hike for the faint of heart but with a little conditioning and lots of willpower, it is doable and the views are totally worth it!

Yes definitely a very tough hike we climbed at least 6 mountain passes that I can remember including the last most difficult one to the top that felt like a vertical climb and not a switchback. And I\'ve done very difficult hikes like Mt. Whitney in one day and Macchu Pichu\'s Inca trail for 4 days. I even think this was more challenging than Mt. Whitney. The last trail climb to the top was more difficult than the 99 switchbacks at Whitney in my opinion. We didn\'t expect it to be hot that day which is not a big help because most of the trail is very open and I forgot to bring my sun hat. So the sun was pretty much on my face which kind of weakened me as well. My Whitney time to summit was 8 hours like this one but if you go all the way to the actual ""clouds"" which is San Jacinto Peak you add another 3 hours at least. That\'s why I consider this the most difficult hike I\'ve done to date and that didn\'t even include the Peak. I had 1.5 L of coco water and 3 L of water. Had at least 1 L of water left. There are 2 rescue stations up there. One guy that I saw turned around which was probably smart. Heard there are quite a few rescues up there as people do not understand or underestimate the degree of difficulty of this hike. BE PREPARED and make sure you know your Fitness level before attempting this trail. Not for the faint of heart! ', ""Hiked the trail from the museum trail head to the mountain tramway station.  Conditions were perfect--70's, sunny with no wind.  Started at 6:45 a.m. and arrived in Long Valley at 1:30 p.m.; GPS recorded 11 miles. I didn't see a single person on the trail until arriving at the top.  Carried 3 liters of water and 1 qt. Gatorade; had one liter water remaining at the end of the hike.  This was the toughest hike I've done yet; the trail is reasonably well marked but I can see how one could veer off (happened to me a couple of times). You will definitely need a map, compass, and GPS. The ride down on the tram was wonderful--there was no way I could have hiked down.  The steepness of the trail near the top was a killer, but the wonderful sights, shade, and pine smells made it worthwhile. I was takiing a chance doing it alone, but it turned out well."", ""Just a note to anyone thinking of doing this trail - it is an extremely arduous hike.  Not only is it a very  steep trail and huge elevation gain but this is the desert and the arid conditions are brutal.  I live here in the desert and have done the Skyline several times.  Every week there's an article in the newspaper about hikers being rescued from the Skyline due to heat exhaustion or just incapacitation.  It should not be considered a summer hike AT ALL.  Spring and Fall are the only really do-able months, and that's with a lot of conditioning and forethought."", ""Hiked this trail on Nov 3, 2011 and got a 3am start at the trailhead, which is a bit difficult to locate. Northwest corner of the Palm Springs Desert Museum parking lot - there is a small labeled opening between a gap in fences. Bring at least 100oz bladder of water and a walking stick is suggested. The real difficult part begins above 6k feet after the sun is up. The trail is relentlessly upward and the altitude becomes a factor for people who are unadjusted. After 8k feet you reach the top of the aerial tramway where you can choose to summit the next 5.5 miles or take the tram back down (will cost around $12). If you choose to summit, refill your water at the ranger station (about .5 mile past the tramway. It's a great hike but very difficult; actually rated one of the top-5 most difficult day hikes in the entire United States. Do your research and prepare adequately, as this is an unregulated trail with little to no emergency assistance available. Incredibly rewarding at the summit!"", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '',

There were very infrequent, brief sections of the path that were narrow, rocky, and/or interrupted by fallen trees.', 'Great trail along the creek, wonderful redwood trees and other flora. All the trail is in the shade so perfect for hot summer days. Note that at one point the trail collapsed, there is a huge tree fallen on the creek, on which you should walk to continue.', 'Definitely a favorite now.  We went August 25, the weather was perfect and in the morning about 9am, there was still parking, but it was filling up..The first of the hike is where you gain your elevation.  Coming back was all downhill.  The redwoods are always breathtaking and do not disappoint and the creek is just a bonus.In August there was still enough water rushing through the creek.  It is nice and refreshing to stick your feet in after hiking for a few hours.As we got closer to finishing the hike more people were headed in and it got crowded.  Definitely worth getting an early start if you want some quiet time with the redwoods.', 'Too many people and walking up on someone dropping their drawers close to the creek was the final straw.', ""WARNING - the trail is completely eroded at https://www.google.com/maps/search/37.06963,-122.10235 going through older comments now I see others mention this and some say you can get through by going into the creek but it may have gotten worse.

Beautiful views too ❤️', 'Went clockwise for this hike. Took about 3.5 hours to complete. The trails are beautiful, lots of different variety of plants and trees. Most of the trail is along the river. Note: this trail is not at the main Henry C. Park., you have to drive to the other section of the park. Overall decent workout and lovely scenery.', 'very nice hike, its between easy to moderate. if you are looking for a  blissful day and spend some time with the music of creek along your way. this is it. :)', 'Ideal hiking difficulty — either direction you choose on the loop is more or less ascending until about the halfway point, and then it’s a good descent. I did the loop clockwise, and luckily I ran into people who had already made a wrong turn at the 5-mike mark to put me on the correct path and prevent me from hiking an extra mile or two. Hiking along the creek was pleasant. The AllTrails map is a must have!', 'Beautiful plants and creek.', 'Nice nature hike not too crowded. Trail was along the creek mostly. No bathrooms so be prepared.', 'Beautiful hike. One of the best in NorCal.', ""Awesome trail. It's actually 9 miles and if you take wrong turns like we did then it becomes 10 miles :D But don't worry it will still be very beautiful and enjoyable. The trail runs adjacent to the Fall Creek and that adds to the beauty of the trail. There are a lot of fallen trees and path going under those trees or go over them. The trail can get confusing since there are places where multiple diversions are possible, so make sure to keep a Google maps or All Trails map on so that you don't get lost. There are a few small waterfalls too on the trail."", 'Beautiful trail. Moderate. Closer to 9 miles than 8 miles according to my Apple Watch GPS. Took about 4.5 hours to complete including a few rest breaks. Beautiful walk in the redwoods. This trail passes by “Big Ben” giant redwood. The trail is washed away for about a 10 yard section on the eastern fall creek section of the loop but if it is passable by just making your way across the large tree and rocks that are over the creek.', 'Awesome spot !', 'all around great trail', ""This is one of the most beautiful Hikes I have ever hiked.With slight drizzle and cloudy skies , it was a amazing hike and I had stopped by the redwood for nearly an hour to enjoy the nature's beauty.  For the most part of trail you will have the pristine creek running by beside the trail. the ascend and descend alternates itself and gives you a pleasure of a good workout. Although there is something about the trail I would like to mention. If you are taking the loop through Fall creek south fork trail and join back the Fall creek trail after hiking Big Ben Trail, then after  hiking 1.3 miles in Fall creek trail from Big Ben along the creek, you will  find that the path has been completely eroded  and there is no way to proceed further. You would have to take a switch back to reach the Truck Trail, then hike thru Ridge Trail and S-Cape Trail to join the fall creek trail back. The switch back is not a well marked trail path and you have to figure it out moving back from the closed path say by .2 miles , this increases the trail distance to 10.3 miles and is not what that has been mentioned."", 'Reasonably challenging, fallen trees to climb over or under, the river or creeks are with you most of the way.  Beautiful trail.', 'Beautiful hike! Got to see two Banana slugs and Big Ben.', 'Absolutely beautiful trail for hiking or trail running. The creek in the bottom is such a treat!!', 'Great hike. Get there early to avoid the crowds. Not an experienced hiker, but was was able to navigate through trail fairly well. If you love the Redwoods and all that it has to offer, you’ll love this hike.', 'Absolutely beautiful forest with a crystal clear creek providing a lovely soundtrack. )The limestone kilns are pretty cool as well.) This is one of the prettiest forests I’ve seen. Pack a nice lunch and maybe your journal or book -there are many places whee you can step off the trail and just enjoy the setting.', ""It's like walking along a trail I read from a book / movie! Fabulous!"", 'Awesome! Love the smell of the redwood.', 'Very good trail. As I read somewhere, the path is laid but the trail is not. Pure wilderness experience with soothing water sounds along side the creek. Big Ben makes an interesting mid point and so does the other spots in between (lost spot, barrel mill site). Didnt found more than dozen people for whole 3 hrs (started 7.30am from parking) and had the whole of forest to explore.', 'Such a nice trail with lots of shade.', 'I really enjoyed this hike! We went to the right at the bridge where it splits off. We were glad we did as we hiked down hill more rather than more uphill walking. There is a part where it gets tricky right when you double back. We had no service but the map would still stay up, just without the blue locator dot. When you need to find the trail to double back, you have to cross left over the creek.. that was the only part I found to be tricky. Absolutely gorgeous!!', ""Great day for a hike! Took some familiar trails and checked out a part of the trail I hadn't been on before."", 'So perfect! Many different trails to try out. And so much water everywhere! This hike never disappoints.', 'Hike seemed very pleasant. But, must warn about few adventurous routes we took. There is one deviation where we need to go below and cross over a branch. Instead, we climbed up a non safe path which was leading to nowhere. So we had to comeback. Otherwise, it was just an amazing feeling in the woods.', 'love it', ""If you go up the steep end, you'll get a good workout, but it's a beautiful hike! There's a point where the trail drops off (Barrel Mill area) due to, what looks like, a landslide or something. Go down into the creek and walk across the large, downed trees to get back onto the trail. This is the only reason I gave it a 4. Also, it ended up 13 miles from the parking lot. That was using 'map my hike' app. Don't know how accurate it is, but it took me 3 1/2 - 4 hours."", ""We intend to take fall creek to another trail and loop around, but we got a late start. We ended up hiking the fall creek trail out and back again. Dogs are not allowed and there is a lot of poison oak, however it's completely avoidable if you stay on the trail. Gorgeous redwoods and ferns all alongside a creek. There were a couple of good inclines but spaced enough apart that by the time you get to one, you've forgotten about the last. The trail is blocked due to a landslide at one point, but it's easy enough to circumvent. Beautiful trail, can't wait to try it again."", 'As of July 2 main trail along Fall Creek is closed 1/2 mile before Barrel Mill due to a slide from winter storms.  If you are an experienced scrambler you can get through it by going down to Creek and crossing logs to reconnect to trail.  DO NOT GO UP THE STEEP HILLSIDE! Hillside is sand and dangerous.', 'This is a gem for hikers. You start your hike with the sound of the water flowing through the creek. Then the ascent will bring you in the middle of the redwood forest. It was never boring and definitely the climb was a challenge!', 'Beautiful trail but ended up a bit longer than 9 miles for us. A portion of the trail on the Fall Creek side is washed away and you have to traverse logs jammed in the river to get around it.  Also many downed trees on that side but otherwise awesome!', 'beautiful and the right amount of challenge for me.', 'The trail had a pretty difficult incline towards the beginning, but there were no problems. Some of the trail markers were missing or confusing, so I used the map on all trails. There were several small bridges out that you could cross on logs or walk through if you have water proof shoes. There were a few spots where the trail was damaged. One part the trail had fallen completely off the side of the hill, so we had to take an alternate route making the trail 2 miles longer. You can see details of locations if you view my photos. Overall good hike, but a lot of incline and decline. If you go the direction I went to the left at the split then the top of the big incline is at ""Big Ben Tree.""', ""Trail above lime quarry washed out in recent storms. Not impassable, but you'll get wet trying."", 'Love this hike!', ""Amazing today. Couldn't get  all the way to the limekilns thought, bridge washed out. But did over 3 miles, lotsa water, waterfalls. Great!"", ""All of the bridges were washed out, but we were able to complete the loop. There was one place where there were no fallen logs and we had to cross through the creek (the stream was pretty wide at this point so the current wasn't dangerously strong). Bring a microfiber towel and a sense of adventure if you plan to do the full loop!"", 'A lot of foot bridges were blown out from recent storms but the scenery was beautiful!', 'Nice trail deep in the forest.

Lots of wild flowers but LOTS of poison oak at bottom of trail.  Very sunny.', 'You can park at the bottom in the park for $6 (cash only). Hike up is a pretty continuous 10% grade. You start in a small forest of trees with lots of birds and flowers. It’s somewhat humid inside the tree forest. About 1/2 way up you reach the edge of the park and enter another wilderness area (forgot the name). There’s a sign that warns you to be back to your car by 5pm but in the summer time you actually have until 8pm. About 2/3 of the way up there is an overlook with great views. A little beyond that you reach an access road to the summit. I often turn around here if it’s too windy or cold or too warm. The weather can vary greatly day to day.  So this is a good place to turn around. The summit walk isn’t too bad and maybe slightly less steep than the rest of the trail. Views are great almost all the way up the trail.', 'My new all-time favorite Bay Area trail. Good ascent. Good elevation. Marine cool. Worth the drive.', ""Really nice! I'd actually recommend hiking this one on a cloudier day instead of a sunny day so that the sun isn't beating down on you. Luckily for this hike, that's most days over here. It starts at a convenient parking lot ($6 entry fee to the park, but you can find parking on the street outside as well. Please support our parks if you can though.) with restrooms just by the trailhead, to the right of the entrance. \n\nFrom here, you'll wind up through a nice Eucalyptus grove then onto some rockier terrain with some scrub brush and beautiful flowers in the Spring. The bulk of the hike is through this type of flora. As far as fauna goes, there are deer sometimes and it looked like there was some Bobcat scat (I saw a Bobcat on a nearby trail so that'd make sense). The first half of the trail is more single track or slightly wider, and the top half is wider. \n\nOn a foggy day near about 2/3 of the way up, you can begin to feel like you're in the Andes, or at least that's how it seemed to me. Really gorgeous scenery on this hike, and at some points you can see both the bay and the ocean at once.\n\nDifficulty-wise, I'd say that this is an 8/10 for the Bay Area. The views are completely worth it. \n\nAlso, if you hike this on a hotter and/or sunny day, I highly recommend bringing lots of water."", 'Great trail with a nice forest setting at the bottom and rock exposure near the top; great views unless the fog rolls in, can get windy and chilly near the summit', 'An easy to moderate climb with well worn footpaths, gorgeous views of coast line, San Francisco and even a glimpse of GGB.

Fragrances all around with the eucalyptus, bay trees, rosemary and the ocean.  We had a semi-clear sunny day. The view was of Pacifica, Highway 1, San Francisco... even Alcatraz! Bring a wind breaker and the hike to summit wasn't too shabby. You'll be walking on textured rocks. The park itself has well kept bathrooms and visitor center. Do remember your $6USD if you are parking at the San Pedro County Park."", ""Best hike within a 30 min drive of San Francisco in my opinion. Wildflowers were in abundance, and even though it looked like we'd have a foggy view when we set off we were treated to blue skies for nearly the entire hike. Bring sunscreen as there's few trees on the upper half."", ""Took the approach from grey whale cove in May.

The trail heads south along the hill above Hwy 1, linking up with the old San Pedro Mountain Road after about 1/2 mile. From there it is easy to follow and well marked all the way to the communication towers up top.  Its fairly steep, especially in upper portions,but there were runners, bikers and walkers of all ages. I found it tolerably strenuous, I'm 67 and not as active as i once was, but very enjoyable. Taking time to soak up the views and chat with other hikers; I round tripped in 4.5 hours.  As always carry water and be prepared for radical weather changes if the fog rolls in."", ""I was confused as to where to start. I parked in the Gray Whale Cove beach lot (that beach is the best kept secret) and hiked along the cliffs overlooking the coast for awhile, and then just followed some worn pathways up. I believe this trail is actually a service road, which you can take from the start (unlike I did, and that starting point is a little further south from where I started). I did eventually connect to the service road. It's a good physically workout and the views are amazing. I give it only four starts because once I reached the top I was disappointed by all the towers. It was anti-climatic. So enjoy the views up and down - because those are the best."", ""very nice liked coming back down into the fog good hike for me and my daughter's"", ""It was foggy so couldn't see much from the top, but still a nice hike regardless.  If you start at the trailhead off HWY1 at gray whale cove, DOGS ARE ALLOWED on-leash all the way to the summit and back.

Not as hard as some of the websites say it is. Yes, you are ascending for half the hike but the switchbacks are gradual and easy for the average hiker. I saw all types of people on this trail, so don't be scared to give it a try! Great scenery the whole way up. Also a surprising amount of shade for a path along the side of the mountain. As other reviewers mentioned, the satellites at the top of the mountain are kind of a bummer, but the view is still amazing."", ""Just a shout out for starting the hike from Pacifica: The amenities include Visitor Center and really really close to start of hike is Upper Crust Deli, Sun Valley small independent (but VERY well stocked) market. Even a barber shop that collects antique barber tools (don't worry, they don't use them-unless you insist). The drive through residential to San Pedro Park for parking is not as stressing as finding parking on the Montara Beach PCH 1 Side. Please read everyone else's review here about the hike, all of which i agree with."", ""A whole lot of fun to run up this trail. It starts at the San Pedro County Park and ends up on a rad trail hugging the mountainside by devil's slide out in Montara. You can also end up back around on Adobe Dr., which is a beautiful enough trail on its own.  You can also get to McNee Ranch from there. Connects to a bunch of other trails for a full, fun day of running or hiking, whatever floats your boat! Pretty good workout as a run considering most of it is uphill."", 'I expected more views but the views from the top were pretty stunning.\n', ""One of my favorite trails in the Bay Area. If I were to take a vistor on a hike, this would probably be it.\n\nI always hike it from a pullout along the 1, across from Montara State Beach. There's not room for more than maybe 4-6 cars, but I believe there's a parking lot a little further down the road (South). There are a few different ways to start the hike, but they all will eventually have sign posts leading you to the summit (or an alternate destination.) The most straightforward path involves walking along a fire road past some stables near the start. Taking a trail that veers more or less left toward the ocean from the trailhead might add a very small amount of distance, but is probably nicer.\n\nAside from the nice distance and elevation gain (perfect for training hikes, especially if you load a pack up with water to dump at the top), the main draw is the view. Along the way, you'll be treated to great views of the beach and ocean. From the summit, you'll be able to see all over the Bay Area, and down the Santa Cruz Mountains.\n\nBe aware that the weather is fairly volatile here. I've definitely left my home, where it was sunny and warm, to find the area cold and foggy. While this can kill the normal views, I've had great experiences at Montara being above the cloud line, creating a different, but still gorgeous sight. I'd recommend clothing that blocks the wind, and possibly a light shell (unless it's a bluebird day).\n\nThe only negative about Montara is how the antennas and building(s?) on the summit somewhat kill the outdoor experience, but it is what it is.\n\n"", ""Great views. A little hard to spot the very top, but it's marked by a flag. Hike maybe pretty hard for some, especially on a hot day. You'll probably be sore the next day. Overall a great, worthwhile hike."", 'This trails has some amazing views. To the west you get to see the ocean, while to the north it has an amazing view of Pacifica.\nGreat trail conditions, but you gotta watch out for mountain bikers racing down hill here and there.', 'This is an amazing trail and park.  I like to go in the foggy days of summer when you start hiking in the thick fog, then as you gain elevation you are greeted with beautiful sunshine and some excellent views of the views.  There are several ways to start the hike to the top, since I live in Pacifica I use the secret trail that used to be the old road from Pacifica to Montara.  Mountain Bikers are also allowed on the trail so be aware of that.  Most of the bikers are courteous, unlike some other areas.  It is best to go on a day with unlimited visibility, you can see Mount Tam, Mount Diablo  and on very rare occasions (in winter) you can make out the peaks of the Sierra.', ""It had been well over twenty years since I last hiked up to Montera Mountain, back when I lived in Pacifica and hiked all over the local hills. At the time, a recently retired gentleman started building a trail out of San Pedro Valley County Park to the Montera Mountain trail. Before that, we had to hike up into the east side of the park and bushwhack up to the San Francisco Fish and Game Refuge along Sweeny Ridge, and then pick up the fire road to the mountain. That was the SF watershed, and I believe we should have had permits to hike there. \n\nHaving last hiked it in the late 80s, it was a treat to return. The Montera Mountain trail starts next to the restroom, off the parking lot. There's a visitor's center a few yards away, but it's only open on weekends. \n\nThe trail is excellent, and wide enough for two to easily walk abreast. It zig zags up the side of the hill, through the chaparral, offering views of more and more of Pacifica at each turn. Then it enters the eucalyptus forest, something the park people tried to eradicate in the 80s, ended up thinning somewhat, but eventually gave up on.\n\nIn the spring, you'd be greeted with an assortment of wildflowers. My winter trip was without anything in bloom, but the lower trail was lined with monkey flower, which should be brilliant yellow by early March. \n\nThere is wildlife along the trail. I saw mostly lizards, cottontail rabbits and lots of birds, but if you hike near either sunrise or sunset, you might catch sight of a bobcat or even a mountain lion. \n\nIt's a well designed trail, with a continual, moderate, comfortable grade with lots of switchbacks and occasional benches where the views are the best, and offer good photo opportunities. Then, at about 1.1 miles, there's a well signed fork, with the left being the Brooks Falls Trail. This is best saved for the return trip. \n\nAbout a half mile further, the trail abruptly changes to a narrow, rocky single track. This is where the sedimentary rocks meet granite. Tectonic forces have brought at least three different rock formations together at Montera Mountain. I found it instructive to pause and see this geological divide. As the trail changes, the rolling land suddenly gives way to rock walls, and the trail winds up the wall. It's the same rock face that causes Brooks Falls. \n\nThe rocky trail gave way further up to a very deeply rutted trail, where the rains and hikers have cut a deep grove. It's a good place to have poles, which I remembered to bring, as there are places where it's one foot in front of the other. There is a pair of signs along this stretch. Going up, the sign says entering McNee Ranch Park. Going down, it says entering San Pedro Valley Park. \n\nAt about 2.4 miles, this narrow trail ends at the fire road. Going right would take you down to Highway One at Montera Beach, a steep fire road. Going left is the last leg of the hike. Along this stretch, there are almost continual views to the south of Pacifica, Daly City, parts of San Francisco and the hills of Marin County. The rock wall on the north is dotted with ferns and lichens. \n\nAlong this fire road, cut out of rock, are the only two steep places, short stretches that felt aerobic. Then the road turned slightly south, and a side trail heads off toward south peak. North Peak, which is slightly higher is along the main road and has transmitter towers on it. \n\nI was almost to the top, when two women walked by me. They were walking and talking, and they stopped just a couple of hundred years from the top, turned around and started down. \n\nA little over a mile on this fire road and there's a left turn at the base of the peak. There were a couple of trucks with men working when I arrived. Walking past where the trucks were parked, another short, maybe five yard path ends at the top. From up there, almost 1900 feet, I had a clear view of northern San Francisco Bay, the airport, with the occasional plane rising over the hills, Oakland, San Francisco, Mount Diablo, over 35 miles away and Mt. Tamalpias in Marin County. Looking south, the coast twisted away toward Half Moon Bay, and to the east, the rolling hills of San Francisco Fish and Game Refuge, eventually dropping down to Crystal Springs Res., along Highway 280. \n\nAfter taking some photos, I sat down on a rock next to the geologic survey marker and had a bit of lunch before starting down. \n\nComing down the short spur to the top, I looked eastward along the fire road. This can be followed a bit further until end ends at the watershed. There are miles of trails in the watershed, and if you are interested, check the internet for trails and access points. As far as alternative routes up to Montera Mountain, there is a trail/road at the end of Higgins Way, off Adobe Dr. in Pacifica, as well as the trailhead just south of Devil's slide at Montera Beach. \n\nBut those are other trips. This time, I retraced my steps to the junction and then down the trail to San Pedro Valley Pa"", ""My memory of the Montara hike is foggy, literally.  I would recommend bringing layers, as the trail is right across highway 1 from the beach and goes up to windy heights.  The views are great and the beach is a perfect place for a picnic if it's not too cold."", 'This is a quite strenous trail with great views of the pacific ocean that takes an average of 3.5 hours to complete with 1800 feet elevation gain. There are several starting points for this trip. I prefer to park at Gray Whale Cove. The first mile is easy and deliver stunning views of the coast (although you have to endure the traffic noise from Hwy 1) then, you can chose Old Pedro Road or a shortcut to the left that takes you directly to the main trail to the top.

of other people that lack trail etiquette.Otherwise great butt workout via Burbank trail!"", 'Short but intense uphill climb, beautiful view of the city and the valley all at once. Gets pretty crowded, and beware parking cops.', 'Excellent views and great workout!', 'Way too packed', 'Very nice hike but it gets packed with people.', 'Overpopulated thanks to IG but only to the flag. I would recommend starting on the left side of the gate it will grant you a more solace steady climb to the top.', 'I do this hike up to the wisdom tree several times a week before work. It’s a fast intense hike. You can be up and down in 45 minutes, including a short stop at the top to enjoy the gorgeous views of the Pacific on one side and Burbank on the other. Many people leave notes of hope at the top in a big trunk under the famous (fire surviving) wisdom tree. The flag is planted by an amazing guy who’s been raising it there in honor of 9/11 for years. When I have time, I continue on to the Hollywood sign, which will take you as long if not longer as it took to get to wisdom tree. And, yes, you can only see the back of the sign. This is NOT where to get your shot of yourself in front of the sign for Instagram. Year after year, I see tourist attempting this hike in everything from flip flops to designer heels. They don’t make it very far. Lately, I’ve been going down the Burbank side of the trail that meets up with the fire road below. It adds a good 45 minutes to an hour to your hike. Accessing it from the main trail is a challenge because it’s difficult to find. This is very steep and sheer rock at points. I like it because it’s usually empty so my dog can be off leash. NOTE:  You can not park at trailhead. Park down below and walk up through neighborhood.', 'The view was amazing. The hike was okay.', 'It’s was a good workout, we took the left side trail to the peak, there were many people at the peak and we saw 2 coyotes when parking our car, overall a good hike.', 'Great view point but overall an average hike. The elevation is all gained in the first mile or so so be prepared for a steep climb out of the gate. It’s not actually a loop even though it says it is. Also be prepared for lots of tourists/unprepared hikers slipping all over the place or struggling to make it up.', 'You gotta make it to the Wisdom Tree! Bit of a tough incline but it’s worth it. And if you press on to the Hollywood sign the you can get right behind it and take some great photos. Love the American flag at the top too. God bless Hollywood and the US of A!', 'did this one a few weeks back it was lovely. not too crowded.', 'One of my new fav LA hikes! It was awesome!! Tough incline but great work out and totally worth the view!! Wear hiking boots if you can.', 'Moderately crowded on a Sunday late morning. The bottom part of the loop (from trailhead to Wisdom Tree to Mt Lee) is very pretty with clear trail; backtracking and heading up the loop counterclockwise the trail isn\'t really much of a ""trail"" at all. We ended up treating the bottom part of the loop like an out and back and then after getting back to the trailhead, went out and back on the first leg of the loop (clockwise) which had better trail. Overall a really nice LA hike and a good workout.', 'Got here round 730 ish not to crowded. This place just turned into my favorite hike! You gotta try this!!', 'Wow great hike and it lives up to the difficult rating. Be prepared with hiking boots and plenty of water I went to the left at the start and did the loop that way definitely will feel this one tomorrow.', 'Definitely hard for beginners but great motivation to start. A lot of people come through that do it a couple times in a row. The top is worth the struggle though and you can see the back of the Hollywood sign at the top.', 'First hike in a while and decided to do it to clear my head. A friend told me it’s a great hike with a little bit of a challenge but nothing too hard. Half way through I was out of breath as I was getting over a cold. The hike was fun, challenging and refreshing. If you want to get back into your hiking mood this is a trail to start with.', 'Great hike', 'I’ve done this hike twice and it’s one of my favorites. I like that you get a little workout and not pushing too many miles. Perfect place to bring friends from out of town. Once getting to Cuhuenga Peak and passing the Wisdom Tree you can make your way to Mt. Lee to get to the back of the Hollywood sign. Planning on doing it at night for the views.', 'An iconic L.A. hike and one of my favorites in Griffith Park, but you need to prepared for a steep, rocky, unshaded climb. The views from the ridge between the Wisdom Tree and the Hollywood sign are great, with the old Hollywood studios to the south, and the newer Warner and Disney studios to the north. On a clear day, your view stretches from the ocean to the San Gabriel Mountains. On a foggy ""June gloom"" day, you look down on the marine layer in the valleys and feel like you\'re deep in the wilderness. Except for the freeway noise. But, like I said, an iconic L.A. hike.', 'First time here and absolutely fell in love with it ... awesome views and inspiring reads!!!! I hung out til it was pitch black..', 'Amazing Hike!!!', ""this was a tough hike straight up and slippery rocks but worth it for the view at the top and it's a short hike just under a mile"", 'Did this but I started near the Zoo.... went up to Amir’s Garden then up towards the ridge. Took some random side trail along a smaller peak to Mt . Lee, and then on to Cahuenga... total trip 6.4 miles', 'Steep incline to start, but a great hike if you’re looking for a workout with a view at the top. You can even hike it to the back of the Hollywood sign. We didn’t complete the loop on the way back because it was getting dark so we took the same way down. We will definitely return and complete the loop. Highly recommend.', 'Great workout', 'Amazing', 'Just did this hike this weekend and was disappointed to find that it wasn’t a loop at all. Went up the steep rocky side to the Wisdom Tree and was planning to come down the longer side of the loop as we had our big dogs and didn’t want to do the steep climb down with them. We passed the “trail” for the other side of the loop twice not even noticing it as it wasn’t an actual trail and no one was walking on it at all. Sent my husband to check it out to see if we could get through and or if it got better along the way but it didn’t, it just disappeared. Couldn’t go that way so had to take the dogs back down the steep side. That cut the hike shorter and was much more difficult with the dogs. Likely wouldn’t have done it if we had known that. Anyone know if there was a reason why that side of the trail would not be there or not be used by anyone on a Sunday? Otherwise it was a beautiful view from the top and could be a great LA hike.', 'Good uphill training but very short and not a lot of coverage. The wisdom tree is pretty neat and there are a few nice places to sit and look out over LA but nothing to write home about.', 'Steep and rocky, good idea to bring poles to take strain off the knees.  Go earlier than 8/9 am before the crowds and bring a light sweater, hat and sunscreen.  Great views 360 of LA and backside view of the Hollywood sign.', 'Steep but not too long. Wear good shoes and a hat......', 'We went out and back to the hollywood sign and stopped at the wisdom tree on the way. Strenuous at the beginning and at the end but well worth it!! Be aware you have to walk through a neighborhood to get to the trail head.', 'Not sure how anyone could rate this better than 3.  Not too well marked, slippery, lots of road noise and a smelly sewage treatment plant. It’s nice that it is close to town and is good for exercise but not a destination hike', 'A challenging alternative to Runyon Canyon with the same breathtaking 360 degree view of Los Angeles.', 'Nice city hike but as a seasoned hiker, I’d rate this one difficult! The north side of the loop is incredibly steep and provides a great workout, but definitely proceed with caution if you’ve got bad knees or aren’t looking to be huffing and puffing on the incline.', 'Great hike. The back side is steep. Hiking poles made it way easier to go straight up. Free parking on the street leading to the reservoir. Great views at the top. Can knock out 3 peaks in one hike!', 'This was a work out for me, you start off with .5 mile steep incline and glute work out but once you get up at wisdom tree it’s beautiful. This hike put a lot stress on my knees , I’ll bring poles next time. Lots of people the day I went.', 'Made an even bigger loop and went down the Hollywood view trail, good hike!', 'Be aware this trail does NOT take you to the front of the Hollywood sign. You will only get a view of the sign from the back.  Misleading photos from people who posted the Hollywood sign. The hike was just ok.', 'Love it', 'Amazing Hike. Doing the full loop is pretty difficult. Super down hill with loads of loose stones to slide on.', 'Steep hill, rocky, tough, but awesome!! Careful with snakes.', ""Great hike, I've done it 3 times already. and each time I forget how much incline there is. But the view at the end is worth it. Plenty of spots for a good picture."", ""This hike caught us a little off-guard. We were just a few days removed from hiking Angel's Landing in Utah and a few trails in Big Bend along the US-Mexico border. Compared to those two locales, we figured this would equate to a leisurely stroll. \n\nNot entirely so. \n\nThere were a handful of factors we sold a bit short on this hike:\n\n1. The Initial Climb: It pushes the casual hiker a little bit (that's us). I'm reading this trail climbs over 1,500 feet. I'm not sure I thought it was that much, but it was still a little bit of a grind right at the outset.\n\n2. Sun Exposure: We should have known better, particularly considering our previous stops.There's virtually no shade on this hike aside from a respite at The Wisdom Tree. That means if you're doing this hike in midday Los Angeles in the summer, you could be looking at temperatures that feel like 100 degrees beaming down upon you for the duration. As always, bring more water than you think you'll need. \n\n3. Dust & Traction: This was probably the dustiest hike we'd ever done. Subsequently, the dry dirt and loose rocks can make things feel a little unstable. Thankfully, I don't recall there being too many spots where a random slip was going to be particularly dangerous (don't think there's many exposed narrow ledges, if any). It was more of an annoyance for my hiking partner than anything else. As the trailer, she saw a pretty constant cloud of dust coming off my hiking shoes. We also both slipped a few times coming back down Cahuenga. They were mostly controlled slips, but it speaks to the terrain. \n\nBasically, we planned on cruising up to the Hollywood Sign real quick but instead ended up with a great workout and pretty dirty shoes and clothes. Still a pretty swell hike. Also, The Wisdom Tree was fascinating."", 'This hike is very challenging for as many tourists and children as I saw on the trail. There is a significant amount of climbing and the terrain is dangerous. I recommend this for experienced hikers.', 'Turn left and take the long way up for great views of Forest lawn, Warner Bros Studios, and the LA river. There was no one else on this side of the loop on a Sunday afternoon so it was very peaceful.', 'I took the ""Challenging"" route... Around back... Not too bad... The views are awesome... You come across a few narrow paths or tight spaces but nice little hike...', 'It was a steep uphill climb. My friend barfed.', 'Great sunset hike!', 'Difficult, but not impossible ', ""Difficult trail. Steep and rocky. I wouldn't do it again."", ""way too many loose rocks on trail. i slipped/fell 7 times and i've never fallen on a hike before/am in shape"", 'Much shorter than I was expecting. The views from the wisdom tree are great on a clear day!', 'Love it!!!', ""Most awesome view up there. Although there's no point in doing the whole loop as indicated in the map. Go up to the Hollywood sign from the starting point, AND COME BACK THROUGH THE SAME ROUTE. The other route on the way back was 90% steep downhill, not that fun. Everything else was great."", 'It was a not easy but they view made it worth it!', 'very steep and rocky, wear boots not sneakers for sure.', 'Loved this hike had a wonderful time!!!', 'Nice little hike, just make sure u go as early as possible. Not really fun when u are dodging people left and right.', 'Great trails', ""A Few Things to keep in Mind...-Bring Plenty of Water. This Trail has very little Shade- Bring shoes with Traction. Climbing to Cahuenga Peak and getting to the Wisdom Tree is not an easy Trail.Okay so we Hiked From Beechwood to the Hollywood Sign, to the Top of the Hollywood Sign, to Cahuenga Peak, to Wisdom Tree. We clocked in about 6 Miles.The Trail to the Hollywood sign can be challenging because of the uphill and no shade but you can always take breaks and rest on the rails. Once you get on the path to Wisdom it's a bit harder. The path is narrow so on most of that Trail only one person fits on it. You will also be climbing over Big Rocks, so expect some climbing to be involved, hence why I mentioned to wear shoes with traction.Once you get to these locations, it is so worth the sweat and tears it takes to get here...."", ""Great hike with amazing views! If you're doing the full loop, at the tower where there's a bench (the beginning) go to the left! We went right and then down the other way, and it was harder. Portions are very steep! Because of the recent storms, there are a lot of loose rocks and sand that can make the trail slick. Wear trail shoes!"", 'A steep trail up to the Wisdom Tree then leads you along a ridge over the Hollywood Sign. Unfortunate amounts of trash litter the path, but on a clear day the views of the sprawling city are breathtaking.', 'Moderate hike. Beautiful view once you get to the Wisdom Tree.', ""Didn't do the whole loop. Went from the Wishing Tree to the Hollywood Sign. I loved this hike, for our first hike of the year it was a great challenge. Introduced a friend to the adventure of hiking and he really enjoyed himself. Perfect hike for a new hiker!! Lots of rocks, single file, rocky trail. Steep, Dog friendly, older child if avid hiker, not stroller friendly, very busy on weekends Trail."", 'Moderate is a good word for the short, steep South side of the loop from Wonder View. But I took the loop clockwise from Wonder View, missed the ""trail"" heading back South to the top (looks like a small rockslide)  and after 50 years of hiking all kinds of trails, ""moderate"" does not do justice to the very steep, rocky, sandy, rutted ridgeline over Warner Bros. lot. Views to the North were spectacular along the way, and it felt good when I got to the Wisdom Tree. I don\'t recommend the North side of the loop unless you\'re looking for more than ""moderate"". At 61 years I\'m in pretty decent shape and was checking out the trail so I know how to take my friend to the Wisdom Tree. He and I are both recovering from traumatic brain injuries. Now I know which way to take him!', ""Its a short hike and once you reach the top, the view is all worth it! You'll be able to see Lake Hollywood Reservoir from there.

So beautiful."", ""It's very fun trail ... lots of up and down areas perfect for conditioning"", 'Short but intense hike up to the top with wonderful 360° panoramic views of LA, Burbank, Studio City, etc. After reaching the wisdom tree, you can hike the ridge that puts you behind the Hollywood sign. Really great way to see the greater Los Angeles area while getting a good workout.', 'we took the trail on the left and then we took what we thought was a shortcut on the right and end up being a workout from hell, just how I like it...', 'Nice trail to get an awesome 360 view of LA.', 'Raw', 'The moderate rating for the loop trail is deceiving.  After leaving the Wisdom Tree and taking the left turn before Cahuenga Peak, the trail descends steeply along the narrow ridge lines.  Very narrow and rocky.  You have to pick your way carefully to avoid slipping on loose rocks and gravel.  Highly recommend trekking poles or a walking stick to steady your way down this loop.  Great 360 degree views from Wisdom Tree and then the Valley on the loop.', 'One of a kind', 'Awesome! Takes about 15-20 min to hike to wisdoms tree at a steady pace without stopping . Feels good, great views.', 'Beautiful view all the way to the Top', 'Awesome... great views!', 'Amazing', ""wisdom tree hike! one of my favorite. there's also a way to go down the long way, which makes this a fun and interesting trail. you end up behind the Hollywood sign, if you take the long way down."", 'Great nature hike for being in the middle of the city.

Enjoy and be cool:)', 'It was tough trail going up to the wisdom tree, but once you get there it levels out for the majority of the remaining hike.', 'Amazing', 'If you start at Wonderview the beginning is pretty intense. After that it is relatively easy. There is usually a large crowd of people at the wisdoms tree.

Normally we hike 3 miles in an hour and this loop took us 2.5 hours. It is very steep and rocky. Some slopes are almost all flat rock or lots of loose rocks. Others are very close to the edge. It was great and beautiful, but unlike the rating of easy according to this app.  Have good shoes, water, and time :)', 'great hike with awesome view', 'I really enjoyed this trail. Made our first stop at wisdom tree. The elevation was fast and steep and kick my butt. At right before the first mile you get to wisdom tree. Then it was a leveled hike towards cahuenga peak.', ""We did the loop clockwise. Be on the lookout for a T junction in the trail that takes you straight up the mountain. We missed it and found ourselves scrambling hands and feet on what looked like a trail...but it just peters out. Once you make the correct right turn you are climbing a full thousand feet. The ridgeline to the wisdom tree is awesome. Almost 360 degree views of LA, the ocean and the valley. Breathtaking! It's fun to build cairns near the wisdom tree. We did the extra bit to the Hollywood sign, I would say skip this part. It takes you behind the sign and you can only see HO. You can't get any closer. We spent a little over two hours on the trail, it was a great workout!"", 'The steep climb to the tree is a butt kicker with little shade! Wear a hat and bring lots of water. The views at the top is a killer 360 of LA. The tree is lovely. We kept going to the epic Hollywood sign lookout and looped around via the fire road. A great urban hike!', 'Vero noce trail and an amazing view of the city. Not for everybody, have to be careful in some part of the trail.', 'awesome hike! we started from western ave, Griffith observatory and this as our last trail. love the scenery and challenge the climb from Hollywood sign. trying a different route next time.', 'Came on Thursday morning around 6:30am - Lake Hollywood Drive only had 3 cars parked including mine. The initial mile is an uphill climb but when you reach the Wisdom Tree, it is a beautiful and peaceful place where I managed to relax and catch a breath with stunning views of LA. The trail to the Hollywood sign was much easier and more straightforward. For a beginner like myself, while it was doable, I was definitely at a very slow and cautious pace especially going downhill. Caught myself too many times slipping and sliding. Be careful!', ""Went on a hot, sunny Sunday afternoon and had the tree all to myself! First time up there, so wasn't sure what to expect. It's a short (about a mile) hike up to the tree, but pretty steep. Had to stop several times to catch my breath! The breezes along the mountainside helped - def take water. Very serene up there. Plenty of stories, notes, words of wisdom and prayers up there, in the stack of notebooks and tags tied to the tree. I just added my words and a prayer for my son to a few of the notebooks. Afterward I did take the trail east towards the Hollywood sign but decided to stop at the peak and take in the vast scenery of the city. It looked to be the highest point in LA, or at least anything south of it in LA County. For sure on my next visit I'll take that trail to the end of where ever it goes! I re-trekked back towards the tree then back down the mountain to my truck on Lake Hollywood Dr., parked about 4 cars from the top. That was about a 3 mile hike. Oh, and there's no signs for the trail, so just walk up Wonder View Dr. (which looks like a private road) past the residences and you'll see the gate / trail entry. Sorry, one more thing - don't leave your trash up there! Take it with you! Enjoy..."", 'Great Hike! Great Workout! Definitely broke a sweat. Started the trail off of Wonder View Drive. Bring lots of water. Up my the ""Wisdom Tree"" you\'ll find a prayer box where you can write a prayer or note and drop in the locked box. Very nice experience.', 'Moderate up and down trail offering views of Los Angeles, Hollywood, Glendale etc.  Similar to the views from atop Griffith Park, but west of the Hollywood sign.  The ""Wisdom Tree,"" gained its name whether deservedly or not, by being the lone tree to survive the Hollywood Hills fire back in the late 2000s.  This probably has to do with the fact that it is at the highest point of the hill, is not surrounding by much shrubbery, and has an attractive shape.  Under the tree, are a couple boxes, filled with notes, letters, and momentos left by previous visitors.\n\n- Parking: Street parking along the street leading to Lake Hollywood, which is just a reservoir.  Ample and depending how far down by the lake you park, you will have a longer walk up the sidewalk to get to the trailhead.\n- Terrain: Narrow and rocky.  Possible to take some hard tumbles, so watch your step in some places.  All uphill / all downhill.  One switchback.\n- Other: At the top, the trail diverges.  The left takes you to the Wisdom Tree and the right takes you to the Hollywood Sign.\n\nThe trail and the area around the tree is touristy and heavily populated especially on the weekends.  If you enjoy socializing, this is a great trail to chat it up with people.  The vibe is really chill and just an FYI, the demographic is generally under 50.', ""Great workout with a steep climb up and great views from the top. I've done this twice as a sunrise hike and can't recommend it enough!"", 'Challenging & amazing hike! We followed the entire loop trail (3 hrs with frequent water stops for the dogs) and loved the steep inclines and the incredible views. I recommend starting really early in morning (due the lack of shade), and bring lots of water and sunscreen.', 'There is abundant parking on Lake Hollywood Drive, then a bit of a walk on Wonder View Drive to get up to the trailhead. My strong advice is DO NOT attempt to follow the trail that is outlined on the map here. Certainly you should start at the trailhead and follow it up to the Wisdom Tree, where the 360 views are amazing!!! But stop following the map there because it is not worth your time and effort to then hike the other side of the mountain down and back. You might want to instead hike East to the Hollywood Sign, which is a clear and popular trail from the Wisdom Tree. Again, the ""loop trail"" that is outlined so appealingly on this map is actually no good. Overall the hike up to the Wisdom Tree is a short but steep and challenging one! Bring water, sunscreen, and strong legs.', 'Top class trail.', 'Descent moderate hike. Pretty steep incline, but short distance to the top. The vistas near the ""wisdom tree"" at the top are pretty nice, especially on a clear day. The optional additional walk over to the Hollywood sign is ok--not a must do.', ""It's a great hike with amazing scenic views of both dtla and the valley. Quite steep in several areas. My friend and I completed this hike in about 3 hours, actually sticking to the zig zagging map they have here. Steep drop offs but I'll definitely return"", ""awsome hike..first time at this location...it's a bit steep so good shoes is a must other than that it was great. sky high view .."", 'Wonderful hike with fantastic views.  The trail is rather steep, so watch your footing on the loose rock and soil; soak in the views.  Start early to avoid the crowds; plenty of photo ops with The Wisdom Tree.', 'Awesome! The Wisdom Tree was very peaceful and calm. The way down from the tree was a little steep and rocky but it was fun :-)', 'Steep climb to the top. It only took me about 25 minutes. The wisdom tree is beautiful, and an automatic awesome photo. The best part was the box full of wishes :)', 'Would say this is a better hike than the holyridge trail. Initial hike from the parking spot to the top is somewhat steep. Word of precaution to those who might do this during the evening and at night time- bring a flashlight, since you can easily slip off the side of the trail. Once you get to the top, awesome views of the L.A. and the valley area. Also fun reading some the stories that people leave behind up there. Happy hiking', ""Steep hike up, but it's not too long and the view and Wisdom Tree are worth it! I did it at sunrise, which I would highly recommend. Great to see the city at that time. Just be careful on the way up, because the trail is rocky."", ""Great hike!!!! It wasn't bad at all! The dog loved the hike and the views is amazing."", ""An excellent hike very steep and it takes 30 minutes to reach the top and play a visit to wisdom tree. Excellent 360 degrees views from San Fernando valley and LA. It's not a busy hiking trails and just local hikes with their dogs. From the top you can see the back of the Hollywood sign. Also u can visit the famous landmark just from the top and following the trail till you reach the pavement road and then you are exactly there. Have fun, take entry of water and some food. 3 hours average doing the whole thing till the Hollywood sign "", 'Steep elevation but not the worst I have done. La Tuna canyon trail is steeper. Nice incline with plenty of good footing areas. Narrow trail have to move to the side to make room for those coming down. Blistering hot today and minimal shade. Great views all the way up. Not too loose dirt or gravel. Got up to the wisdom tree took some pictures and headed back down. You can see the back of the Hollywood sign, Dtla,  observatory, Burbank. Pretty lonesome up by the tree it was nice to have it all to ourselves. Not as challenging as I though on the way down. Did opt to slide down on my bum right off the top but pretty felt safe walking int down after that. Plenty of parking on lake Hollywood and the paved road up its too long. Will go again.  Took us 45 min up and 45 down. ', 'Goof for 1 time hike. Nice 360 degree view from the top.', ""It's steep hike all the way upto Wisdom Tree. It hardly took little more than 1 hour to complete the loop. The view at the top is awesome - you can see whole Burbank, Griffith Observatory, Hollywood lake, downtown. "", 'If you want to see it all this is the hike to go on', 'Drove from ventura county, trail was narrow the whole way. The amount of trash made me disappointed and not want to return. Best part of the day was the vegan lettuce wraps and portabella mushroom sandwich from Sun Cafe after the hike!', 'great view and work out! puppy friendly! you can see downtown, Burbank, obsrvertory, Griffith park and the ocean (on a clear day)', 'Quite a climb! Excellent views of Lake Hollywood and surrounding areas. Definitely will go back.', 'First time and it will not be my last.', ""The trailhead is a little hard to find.  It's at the end of Wonderview Dr which is a residential street. The trail is narrow and rocky but the views of the Griffith, Burbank, Downtown, and Lake Hollywood make it worth it!

Two people that had done this scramble through the rocks led our group. Several times occurred when foothold coaching was necessary, or there was complete darkness, or you had to lie flat and shimmy through narrow spaces. At one point, you come to a sort of window in the side of a mountain with big rock ledges where you can sit in the sun, take in the views and see activity in the parking area below you. I got pretty bruised up from this scramble but it was super fun.', 'Fun to climb around on the rocks!!', 'Easy nature walk on a cool day. Interesting rock formations.', 'Wonderful view!!

There are parts where we carry the 2 year old, but other than that the littles can do most of it and enjoy climbing.', 'What great place to hike. This hike has some good views of the rocks and I also saw a few rock climbers.', 'This is more of a nature walk than a hiking trail, but it is absolutely gorgeous and unique!  This valley is surrounded with massive boulders which are relatively easy to scale.  If you go off the trail there are slots to explore and amazing flowers and wildlife!

Great picture opportunities. Spotted a Stellar's Jay on the route. Often very crowded so pcik your visitation time carefully."", ""This was a nice little trail that went into a valley with a mini unique ecosystem.  We went in December during a period of unprecedented visitation, so as expected, this trail was busy.  In fact, this trail is heralded as the most popular in the park.  The trail has its own parking lot and vault toilet.  It requires some light climbing up and down rock stairs throughout, but nothing too extreme.  No hiking poles are needed.The trail recommends you proceed clockwise on the loop to better pair with the informational placards.  I don't think December is the optimal time for this trail as many of the plants were dormant or not in blood, but it was still beautiful as it wove thru unique rock formations along the way."", 'Fantastic little loop to venture off and do some bouldering.

Would also suggest going on a clear day (if you can find one, haha), as everyday we've gone it's been super foggy!"", 'Great workout with beautiful views', 'Amazing time. Saw the Marin headlands. It’s amazing', 'Beautiful 2hr loop.', 'Great hike, not too many views since the fog was covering the majority of the trail. Make sure to go on a clear day.', 'I feel like this trail was pretty moderate. If you aren’t use to hiking up pretty steep inclines, this hike may not be for you. Make sure you don’t miss the Wolf Ridge trail head. Heading up near Hill 88 had me distracted and I never saw it. If you hit the graffiti then head back down the hill and look to your right for the trail head.', 'Easy trail, lots of parking right near the beach.The trail is mostly fire roads with a short section on stairs. There are several areas that have been rerouted because of closures. The eastern half coming down from Hill 88 is slightly boring as there aren’t many views and you can’t see the beach. There were several Batteries and other historic things to see along the way.', 'Nice and easy hike, beautiful views.', 'Great loop with a nice stopover on hill 88. Takes 2-3 hours with leisurely pace.', 'Great hike for lots of variety to keep kids entertained.', 'The hike started off subtle. We were hiking on flat gravel then the trail began to incline & it became more steeper the further we went. The view was beautiful. I brought binoculars & go to see a deer. Make sure you bring lots of water. I enjoyed it I would go back !', 'Beautiful hike by the coast. A little windy near the water, but views are worth it at the top!', 'Fantastic hike. Challenging in the beginning, but well worth it for the views. The ocean breezes are heavenly and the route is not very crowded. Not a very complicated route, just pay attention.', 'Great view but easy to get lost.

Will be back soon!', 'Absolutely beautiful.  We will be going back sometime in the near future.', 'Beautiful hike! The views are stunning. You get a steep hike at first and a nice downhill at the end. Reference your map as it’s easy to go off the trail. Go early too! We started at 8 am and it was perfect!', 'Absolutely loved this hike! So much to see and do. There is something for everyone. Moderate hike with amazing views. ', 'Beautiful!', 'I did this hike on my own, it was great. The weather was perfect and the views are outstanding. Totally doable, but an excellent work out.', 'Beautiful and relatively relaxed trail that goes inland and to the beach.', 'Easy hike but also easy to loose the trail.

Plenty of parking with public restrooms.', 'Beautiful views and a good variety of trails to mix it up.', 'Majestic views, frog concert and sunset upon returning to the trailhead.

Beautiful views of SF. Bring water.', 'Great trail with amazing views. Moderate difficulty, but very doable', 'This is a beautiful hike.  Plenty of parking down by the beach.  The beginning of the trail has labels for leashed dogs but once you clear crowds and get on the fire road many people had dogs off leash.  I started hiking in the afternoon and return to the trailhead around the time for sunset.  Very serene to watch the sunset on the cliffs overlooking the water and hearing the waves below.  The trail was not that crowded.  The elevation change if you do the entire loop is a nice little workout.  Once the sun was down I even heard tons of frogs in the field beside the parking lot.  If you do the full loop and have dogs off leash make sure to put them back on leash when you get to the lagoon area.  The cars surprised me around the corner as the road was right there but doggies were safe.', 'We started the loop at the end of the parking lot. Views of the ocean then Bolinas. As we rose, a bit steep and a good workout, we finally saw Tennessee Valley then Mt Tam, mill valley opened up below us. We could see Sonoma and Napa and then rounded the turn, so Sausalito was spread below. The East bay, The bay bridge and Golden Gate Bridge. Mt Diablo and SF came into view.  Fabulous views, steep hikes and easy courses. You can turn down and make it shorter or extend the hike easily. Dogs are not allowed on the extended part. Enjoy!', 'From the Rodeo Beach parking lot go clockwise: Coastal Trail - Wolf Ridge Trail - Miwok Trail - Rodeo Valley Trail - parking lot.

Not too difficult, although there's almost no shade, so wear sunscreen!"", 'I took the suggestion to go counter-clockwise which was beautiful as the sun was going down and def worth the short divert to Hill 88.

The view of the Golden Gate Bridge would have been better if there had not been any fog.', 'Amazing hike, moderate, with stunning views!', ""Great hike! Went with my dog! Here are two tips!\n\n(1) if you start at the parking lot most people go clockwise. For a more spectacular climax, and to get the slightly boring and flat bits out of the way first, I suggest going counterclockwise.\n\n(2) Take the slight detour for Hill 88. It's not that much longer and gets you to a higher peak."", 'great hike with your pup! whale sightings!', 'Pretty nice mellow hike', 'Stunning views out here! Always on the hunt for dog friendly paths, and we were able to take him off leash. Part of the trail is on a paved road but we deviated a bit to get off it and gain some extra elevation. Can get pretty chilly and windy even on a clear, sunny day.', 'Great loop trail with stunning scenery! Bring your dog, but watch out for rattlesnakes!', '', 'Easy parking at Rodeo Beach.  I went clockwise up the Coastal Trail - uphill for 1.9 miles and a bit of a workout.  The rest of the hike is easy - downhill and then flat through the valley.  Great open vistas the entire way.  Excellent coast/ocean views during the first half of the hike.', 'We veered into this trail from the easy Tennessee Valley Trail. Beautiful sweeping coastal views!', 'Not much shade, and some parts can be steep, but the views are pretty awesome. My dog had a great time too.', 'I took this trail and expanded to a total length of 8 miles: At the Wolf Ridge Trail meets the Miwok Trail, instead of turning right, I went straight and continued onto Miwok Trail, Bobcat Trail and then back to Miwok Trail. At the end of the Miwok Trail, I turned right onto the Lagoon Trail and back to the parking lot. Most trails on this loop are fire roads good for biking but not the best for hiking. At the peak of the Miwok Trail there were some gorgeous views of the SF Bay.', 'Solid trail with nice views throughout. A popular route, but not too crowded.', '', ""This trail was so great!! We took a dog with us, didn't run into any trouble. We took the trail counter clockwise( I definitely recommend going this way). It's a long gradual way up and around but on the way down back you get the amazing views of the coast and get to have fun with all the old military stuff around. I also recommend taking a little detour and going up to Hill 88. Bunkers and views await up there. The trails are extremely well marked and maintained. We went on a weekday so parking wasn't hard, but there is lots of options right by the beach on Mitchell Rd. And if you follow along there is also a big parking lot with bathrooms. It was a cool sunny, slightly windy day but if you go in the summer bring lots of water because there is practically zero shade along the whole trail. AMAZING HIKE!! \n\nI've added some pictures from this hike on: http://vsco.co/daianasegura/"", ""It was pretty, with great views on a clear day but most of the trail was dirt road or along a road and it was very exposed to the sun. We did it on an unusually hot non-windy day so that may be why we didn't love it. A lot of the trail also is littered with old bunkers if you are into that but it takes away from the nature a bit."", 'We did this trail for the first time when we did the Golden Gate Trail Run!  Super challenging and beautiful!  Looking forward to getting back there for a nice hike!', 'Really nice for a shorter hike.  I did this on a Saturday, so instead of just launching directly into the hike, I stopped by the Nike missile base (SF88) at 11:30 to do the guided tour first.  Definitely recommend it.  You do really need to be there at 11:30 though -- self-guided tours aren\'t permitted.\n\nI did the hike clockwise, which has you starting at the Rodeo Beach parking lot at the end of Mitchell avenue, then heading northbound up the coastal trail.  It\'s steep-ish towards the top, with some stairs, but the first part is mild switchbacks that take you by Battery Townsley for a nice ocean view.  Near the top expect some decent wind and fog if it\'s that kind of day.  My knees don\'t like steep downhill pounding, so I prefer doing the steep gradients uphill.  If you\'d like a more gentle climb and a gravity-assisted descent, definitely do this hike in the opposite direction.\n\nFrom there, you continue on the coastal trail as it turns east toward hill 88 (the control site for the aforementioned Nike base).  It\'s worth a quick side-trip to the site to have a look around.  As is standard military nomenclature, ""hill 88"" refers to the height, in this case 880 feet -- the top of your climb on this route.  If you do the hike clockwise, you\'ll hit 880\' in a little over 1.5 miles.\n\nAfter returning to the coastal trail from the Nike control site, you again head east until it turns into the wolf ridge trail (also called coyote ridge on some maps).  At this intersection the coastal trail almost double-backs on itself, heading northwest down towards the Tennessee Valley.  Keep heading east on the wolf ridge trail.\n\nYou\'ll intersect the Miwok trail and turn southbound.  From this point on you\'ll be on the leeward side of hill 88, so the wind dies down and the temps creep up.  It\'s a gentle, meandering up-and-down all the way back down to the Miwok trailhead and a short  walk along Mitchell road westbound back to your starting point at the Rodeo Beach parking lot.\n\nLots of flora and fauna to ogle.  Tons of wildflowers in bloom when I did this in early July.  Also saw: bobcat, turkey vulture, red-tailed hawk, a mule deer and tons of western fence lizards.  \n\nVery lightly traveled for a trail in the Bay Area on a Saturday.  Only saw 3 others on the trail.  A free trail map is available at the visitor\'s center on Bunker Road, along with some interpretive exhibits.  Just follow the signs on your way in.', 'amazing views, we went off trail and climbed in old bunkers. what an amazing piece of history!', ""Recommend to park at the visitor's center and hike this counterclockwise up Miwok Trail to Wolf Ridge Trail then back down the Coastal Trail. Miwok trail is a good warm up, mostly all gradual uphill about 900feet, then the Wolf Ridge trail is narrower mixed with flat, downhill, and some steep uphill sections but wonderful views of the hills. At the end of the wolf ridge trail you're rewarded with beautiful coastal views and as you continue down the coastal trail come across various military bunkers, views of SF, and some glimpses of the Golden Gate Bridge until you're back at sea level on a small beach. As you walk back to the parking lot on the south side of the lagoon there's even some shaded areas of vegetation to mix things up. A good rewarding 5 mile loop that gets your blood pumping but it by no means very difficult for the average person."", 'I really enjoy this trail in the mornings with my dog. Dogs are allowed off leash (under voice control) along the whole length. I try to walk this loop at least once a week, and it is well-used by bikers, hikers, and trail-runners. Personally, I prefer to park at the visitor center and walk the loop counterclockwise. That way your ascent is on a nice steady grade for the most part, and the descent has wonderful bridge and ocean views. Finish by walking along Rodeo Beach (your dog will love this!) then loop back to the visitor center along the coastal trail on the south side of the lagoon. But please be careful that your dog does not enter the lagoon boundary, as there are sensitive birds and amphibians there.Tip: make a detour to the top of Hill 88 for vistas and some urban archaeology!', ""Challenging climb to the top offset by a great stroll a hundred feet up along a mile of the coast. Once you get inland it's kinda boring but the trail is well maintained."", 'Good trail with a little bit of climbing - there us an option to do this trail, upto a point, on the street, while not super smooth, not a bad road bike road either.

We saw quite a few pet owners with their dogs on the trail, so very dog-friendly.  We didn't see too many young 'uns, however, there were a few at the top.  I'm pretty sure mine wouldn't have been able to make it due to the heat and how steep the trail is near the top.\n\nWe did saw a few mountain bikers and trail runners, but they obviously were more dedicated than I was... I'll stick to hiking.  Take lots of water because you'll need it.  I was soaked with sweat by the time we got back to the car.  Also, we didn't see too much wildlife besides bugs and hummingbirds at the summit.  Was hoping to get some pictures of snakes, but they were all hiding somewhere when we went.\n\nThe trail we took which seems like the back trail was much less crowded than the trail on the front side of the mountain, which was nice.\n\nOnce we got to the top, the view was absolutely stunning.  360 degree panoramic views make the mostly uphill hike very rewarding.  When you're at the top, you definitely feel a sense of accomplishment!\n\nBecause of the views near the top and the great workout, this trail is definitely 5 stars!!"", 'Had to do this hike again because I enjoyed it.

I found the steep incline at the last quarter of the hike to be rather challenging (then again it was pretty warm today). It took me about 54 minutes to the top at a steady but not hurried pace. I'll likely do this hike again. "", 'You can hike up Cowles the boring, overused way, or from this way. From Mission Gorge rd. turn south down Mesa rd. and you can either park by Big Rock park and enter the trail here, or continue south down Mesa rd until you are on a dirt road and continue down until the road dead ends to a metal gate. I like to park here and go up the dirt road until you see the trailhead on your right. Either of these ways will give you about a 4.4 mile hike which can be completed in about 1 hour if you run some, or 2 hours if you walk most of the way. The two trailheads mentioned here intersect about half way up then take you to a fireroad which you turn right on all the way to the peak. The hardest part of this trail is the steep ascent at the very end. I do this hike 3-4 times a month as it is close to me and you are given some solitude because it is not over-crowded like the Navajo-Golfcrest side. I have only seen one rattlesnake here and I have been countless times. Enjoy!', ""It has been said that this is an easy trail that's good for beginners and out of shape people. The Mission Trails Regional Parks official trail map, rates this trail as a 5 on a scale of 1 to 5. I've not found a document, on their website, that explains the basis for their trail rating system, but having hiked pretty much every trail in the park, I've found the higher the trail rating the more physically demanding the trail is. The point being if you are in good shape you'll probably find this trail easy, if you are not in good shape or are chronologically challenged, as I am, you will probably find this trail a bit physically demanding. However, a slow steady gate should get most to the top. Once there, particularly on a clear day, the views of downtown, Point Loma, the mountains to the east and other suburban areas are worth the trek. The south trail to the summit of Cowles is very popular and this tends to make the trip a bit like being in a crowed mall, which makes the less used north approach, more appealing to grumpy old geezers such as myself. It's longer, but gives one more of a feeling of solitude.  If you are looking for a longer hike, there's a side trail of about 1.5 miles that will take you to Pyles Peak (also rated by MTRP as a 5). On the day I made that hike, I think I saw three other people on the trail. So, if you want a trail for exercise, views, walks with friends and ease of access, give the North approach to Cowels Mountain a shot."", 'Good place for hiking Starters, Its a diferent view from San Diego', ""It's a pretty decent hike to take your dog or to go with friends who are not in great shape. It's a pretty easy hike and there's not much to look around once you get to the top. Also, there's always a lot of people there and I don't understand why because it's not that great of a hike. If you're looking for a great workout, I would try Devil's Punchbowl or Mt Woodsen, but definitely not this hike. If you're not in great shape and you want to exercise or take your dog on a walk or randomly decided you wanted to do something outdoors with your friends then this is the hike for you. It's a good beginner hike and you'll definitely still be able to talk as you walk. The people on the trail are super friendly and you get to see a wide variety of people hiking so that's always fun. It's not that hard so I wouldn't bring a lot of water but definitely bring sunscreen! It definitely doesn't take 3 hours though; Last time I went I was with my mom and her friends who are all well above 45 years of age and not super athletic and it took us an hour and 20 minutes."", 'I thought this was a great loop!

DO take some water and sunscreen because you are exposed most of the way unless you find a boulder or bush to rest under.', 'The northeast approach of Cowls mountain is a little less busy, but probably my least favorite due to the fact you are on a fireroad for the last part of the trial.  It starts out nice from the bottom, but once it does hit the fireroad its kind of boring.

Probably wont die of dehydration, but you will be very thirsty.  Crowds were limited on the trail, there were lots of people on the summit that had taken alternate routes.

wasn't until I was leaving that I was able to find the actual trail I was supposed to be on when going to the waterfall & punchbowl. Trail starts easy enough, then you get to a point, and this is Important!, where the trail seems to split, KEEP LEFT and look for a large boulder with colorful markings. You'll see a bunch of downed trees, go over them there isn't many and you'll see the trail continues. I posted pics of what you need to be looking for. Going this way does stray away from the creek, you can still hear the creek though, but so much faster. I got there originally trying to follow colored markings and rocky hiking through the riverbed, it took forever. Had it not been for finding the correct trail I probably wouldn't have come back. That being said, scenery is great, lots of areas that I imagine during the Summer months would be fun to hang out along the Santa Paula creek. Next will be another split where the trail looks it follows along the creek or you head up along the mountain side. Either is correct, more of a personal choice, I went up, great views looking down over the valley and you do reach 2 camps before the waterfall/ punchbowl, from this trail you see the waterfall from the camp nearest the edge. I can't speak for the creek route, but hear its better to do this route when its hot. I will also add that there are 2 times on the mountain route that are a bit cumbersome.  A  steep, rocky gully and exiting the trail right onto the creek, it's steep & narrow too.  Once there, lots of exploring and water to play in!"", ""I have hit this trail over 10 times and every time have made it to the bowls, even the hidden ones way up top in the back of the main ones. The arrows are very difficult to try and follow but become helpful if you are lost. All I can say is that if you follow the stream and keep an eye out for those helpful arrows, you'll have a blast! It eventually ends up at a split and you just want to make sure you stay to the right side once you get to that point, if you don't see the bowls after about 2 hours, double check with people you see or check a map!"", '', 'Follow the arrows, they said. This works until the last 1/3 when it gets almost comical. Hard to find the arrows if you stay low/creekside.  When the trail splits, I recommend you take the high road. All the climbing over and around rocks probably added an hour to the hike. Feels like you’re a million miles away from town, so worth the long afternoon!', 'After reading the reviews I was prepared to see a lot of trash and graffiti everywhere and tons of people but I didn’t encounter much of that. People must be picking up after themselves!', 'Was excited to do this hike and it was definitely different considering the scenery and that you are right along the stream. But that being said, we didn’t make it to the punch bowl. The arrows were less clear at the end and we were with our pup and the rocks were getting bigger and it had become more dangerous than was comfortable for us. It sounds like there are multiple ways to get to the end - we tried to stick to the red line on the All Trails app Esther than the dotted line. Thinking the dotted line could have actually gotten you there and been easier than the red line, which was right along the creek. The dotted line seemed to be out in the hot sun, which some people were referencing in their reviews. We likely won’t do it again but if we did, we would go the dotted trail route. Would be cool if someone else could confirm that for others using the app!', ""Great hike! Not sure why this is rated moderate. It's definitely easy. It's flat the whole way. The trail gets a little messy sometimes and you have to go over rocks and cross the river but nothing crazy. This was absolutely lovely."", 'Loved this trail arrows are everywhere make side to make it to the back pool where there is a waterfall and rope to climb', 'I have done this trail twice! Both times it was pretty hot out so make sure you bring plenty of water with you. You can hike two main ways through santa Paula canyon, or along the water to the punch bowls. I preferred going along the water the second time because there was more shade and I enjoy an occasion splash when I get hot but that’s just me! However stunning views overlooking the canyon if you follow the main trailhead/orange and green markers! There is trash unfortunately so be a handy earth lover and bring a trash bag with you, it made me feel better cleaning up as I went. But the Punchbowl was awesome! Fun area to have a picnic and say hello to fellow travelers!', 'Super great trail a bit confusing at times really fun', 'Great place to go hike and spend time with friends and family. Highly recommended to those who love to hike and admire nature. Also great cliffs to jump off if you are into that!\n!!!GO CHECK OUT MY VIDEO ON THE SANTA PAULA PUNCH BOWLS!!!!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3na2KTAzXSw', 'Great Trail. A bit confusing at times. Looking for green or blue arrows to remind you your goin correct way. Apparently there are multiple ways to get to first punch bowl. Tiring but so worth the hike when you take that jump in pool. Planning to go back but explore the other bowls.', 'Trail can be a bit confusing at times but as long as you follow the arrows you will get there. And it’s true, you have to park on the highway and walk up a steep paved hill through the college and some dirt road next to some job sites just to get to the trail head but it is worth it! Wear sunscreen, comfortable shoes, and a bathing suit if you want to jump in! It can also be a cool hangout spot if you want to bring lunch, drinks and some music to reward yourself at the top.', 'There’s no marked parking area. You have to park on the highway and walk about 1.5 miles on a paved road before you even get to the trail. There is trash littered everywhere. Almost all the bigger rocks have been tagged-kids suck. The trails are marked with blue/green/red paint which is somewhat helpful if you ignore the colors and just follow the markings. I took my dogs with me and they played in the water a bit but they smelled like a sewer when we got home.', 'great trail but careful - I almost stepped on a rattlesnake (Southern Pacific Rattlesnake from doing some research) there today!! Was down by the river about 3 miles in. It was just under a fallen tree trunk about a foot off the ground that I was walking on - from the path to the river.', 'This could be really beautiful, but people ruined it by leaving trash everywhere and graffitiing the rocks. I don’t understand why people would want to trash something so beautiful!Leave no trace!', 'This is a gorgeous hike but I was SO disappointed by how much trash was on the trail. Picked up 17 water/Gatorade bottles and three dog poop bags worth of garbage. I don’t understand how people can hike to enjoy nature and then trash it.', 'Good cliffs to jump off ', 'Great hike and do-able with kids. Watch for snakes!', 'Pretty good hike. Not hard at all. The trail does disappear so be careful we met some people getting lost. There are distinct purple/green/red arrows on rocks so look down and follow them! Or else you will be lost through the forest/stream. If you get there early enough don’t park in the street, drive in and there is very LIMITED park by the main entrance. It’s 3 in and 3 out of you want to go to the first punch bowl. That one is very nice. Be early or else you deal with families/young people etc. I went to the second waterfall. Got started at 8 Am and was done by 12ish... keep in mind we jumped in and swam a little. Pack a light lunch if you want to hangout, swim suit, towel and water shoes it’s a fun spot.', 'Close,Water, and beautiful ', ""We went last week. Lots of vegetation, but the trail disappeared on us, and we didn't get to finish."", 'Go early to avoid the crowds and noisy party animals that like to hike to the punch bowls to swim, drink and play loud music. Winter is a much more pleasent time to do this hike. I prefer to take the marked trail up to the campground and drop into the bowl, rather the follow the trail shown on the map which turns into a lot of boulder hopping. It is nice to see the changes occurring after the Thomas Fire, and to see southern California fire ecology at work. Some interesting wildflowers can be see right now (June 24, 2018).', 'The first time we went on this hike we took the more common route (I think it’s the more common route?) and it started off nicely with plenty of shade but it eventually progressed to a more exposed route. The vegetation is charred from an obvious past fire—really sad. I imagine that before this fire, this route was probably shaded and pleasant. We made it to the first punch bowl after a pretty warm walk. The second time around we started our hike earlier in the AM and we took a different route which was shaded 90% of the way and required lots of scrambling/water crossing—waaaay more fun than our first trip~! But be very careful with slippery rocks and careless climbing. We were hoping that we would make it to a different punch bowl while on the second route but it only led us to the same/main punch bowl. Very fun/active hike if you take the right route but so So Very Sad to see lots of graffiti and trash left behind at the punch bowl(s)~!! Please clean up after yourselves and your pup~! We will most likely return and try to find the other punch bowls soon~!', 'Went two weeks ago. Started at 10:30 am and came back at 5:30. Of course there were lots of breaks taken a good amount of time spent at the first punch bowls. There isn’t an obvious trail but there are orange and blue markers on the trees and arrows on the rocks. As long as you hear the water you will be ok. It was a real fun time and we thought we brought a lot of food and water for two but we barely had enough lol. Every chance we got we splashed water on our legs to keep fresh the whole way through!', 'Beautiful trail but must start early and take plenty of water and walking stick or it helped me.. ..at end of trail it’s all well worth just for the amazing punch bowl..', 'Awesome hike!', 'Amazing hike! It’s now open. Got to the first punch bowl at 10am with no one around and it later got crowded. Had a hard time finding the other punch bowls so just swam around the first one!', 'The trail is actually open. Mostly shaded. You crossed a couple streams. Pay attention to the trails. Like people said followed the arrows would be okay however, not really reliable since some faded away. Today we also found someone purposely blocked the arrow, which was really upsetting. Luckily we caught us on the wrong trail fairly quickly. When you go up there, the stream shall be ""mostly"" in your right hand side sometimes aren\'t. It is opposite on the way back, the stream shall your left side. I felt taking a dog can be hard on dog if the dog isn\'t trained. Some parts require you to climb on big rocks.', 'Came back to see the Punch Bowls.  We were unaware of a sign saying it was closed, but we were allowed in.  Lots of groups and families were out on the trail.  It was sad to see all the damages the Thomas Fire left on and in the surrounding areas of the Punch Bowls.  Despite that the Punch Bowls was still there alive and beautiful as before.  A lot of scrambling on the hike due to the fire.  If you’re familiar with the trail then it shouldn’t be difficult to get to the falls.  The green arrows on the rocks should lead you there.  Otherwise, you can follow the creek.', 'We arrived March 24, 2018 after several days of heavy rain. The security guard was turning people away as the trail was closed. No idea when they will reopen.', 'I couldn’t find anywhere about the condition of this hike after the fire. So I went and checked it out. Same easy access to it gate is open and no one stopped us from going in and also no posted “area closed” signs. For the most part the trail along the river bed was untouched by the fire, lots of mud and rock slides Have happened though and saw a few times rocks come tumbling down while we were up there. The water is dingy and cold so we didn’t go in. The trail up the hill away from the river was also slightly washed out by mud slides and lots of fire damage that way, cool sight to see plus right now there is new green growth coming through the black and ash. I recommend it. Wear boots.', ""Very sad to hear that this trail has been destroyed by the Thomas fire. This was one of the best hikes I've ever found. I hope that it will be restored within my lifetime so I can go hike this majestic trail again..."", ""They only just lifted the restrictions in the non burn areas of the Los Padres, it's going to be a good time before they start allowing people back into the burned trails. Press release announced the fire was officially 100% contained, but all burn areas are still closed as they attempt to clean up. You can always call your local forest service office to inquire about trail closures prior to setting out."", 'Great and very extraneous hike.  Waaay too much damage to the trail from the Thomas fire and landslides from last weeks rain causing a lot of the trail to be hidden under all the mud and fallen trees.', 'Great hike, lots of scenery, nice creek, a few small waterfalls, jumped in one of the punch bowls. Trail is not entirely obvious if you’re a new hiker. Overall would go again. Bring water', 'Great trail, challenging enough. The second punch bowl is even more impressive. When almost reaching the destination and when you get back to the stream, turn left and follow the stream until you see the falls on your right. To see the second punch bowl, climb up the canyon from the right side of the falls. Enjoy the view!', 'Wouldn\'t say it\'s ""heavily trafficked,"" but you\'ll definitely see people here...some of the natural slides have been washed out by heavy rainfall and debris from last year. Wondering if anyone has an update on this from recent visits?', ""Parked on side on the road and walked up through college to the trail head. Trail went along the stream the whole way till you get to the bowl. Nice and easy hike. Not many views other than looking at the waterfall at the end where the bowl is. Lots of shade the whole time. The water level was only about 5' at the bowl so no jumping in, other than that the water was nice and cool."", 'Went with my best friend today, and I didn’t expect it to take quite so long to get to the punchbowls, but it was well worth the wait! We were a bit lost on the trail a handful of times as it disappears over boulders and the stream, but if you just follow the stream up, you’ll eventually get there. We also ran into a medium rattlesnake and 2 smaller garden snakes. I would bring bug spray if you can (lots of annoying gnats during this time of year), and drink a lot of water.', ""I liked the variation on this trail: college campus, some oil rigs, avocado trees, canyon views, and some punch bowls and waterfalls at the end. An out and back that's interesting enough that it doesn't matter you're walking the same path back."", ""I was really disappointed that me and my dog could not make it to the punch bowls. The further you went the more rocks you had to climb, which was almost impossible with my dog. I especially wanted to go on this hike because it says ok for dogs. However, in my opinion it is not unless you don't mind making it all the way. Please ensure if you check a hole as ok for dogs that it doesn't Include climbing rocks and carrying the dog to the. Find out the way gets more and more difficult and you need to have both hands free to make it, therefore carrying him wasn't even an option...."", 'So good! A little bit of ""rock climbing"" and loose gravel on steep climbs make this a moderate hike. Try to time your arrival at the punch bowl with the sun. It was cold when we went.', 'If you go up to the second punch bowl, 1 person on the guide rope at a time!', 'easy. kids can do it. worth the cool down at the first bowl.', 'Not so easy for pretty awesome.', ""Amazing hike if you're going during the hot season, take lots of water!! Little bit of everything on this hike, there was open areas in straight sun, then you get into the creek area with shade and its much cooler, after you get to the first punchbowl, you can climb up and around to the top punchbowl and the view is amazing!! I'll def come back *please pick up your trash/pick up trash if you see it "", 'One of the best hikes I have done lately. The only park that kinda sucked was waking up the road to access the trailhead. The hike is solidly moderate but nothing too crazy. We took our 2 year old gold retriever/German shepherd and he made it all the way to the water fall and punch bowl. Best part of this hike is the punch bowl. There is a rope to climb up and jump off ledge. Make sure to bring plenty of water as it can get hot when not shaded.

I only made made it to the first punchbowl, swam inside for about 30 minutes and went back. Definitely going back for the other ones.

On the way back, the trail is nicely marked with white and pink ""X"" so pay close attention to those.

Just you will be doing multiple crossings along the creek as well as maneuvering around boulders and rocks the entire time. It moves slower. The high ground on the way back was better movement, but not as much shade on a bit day. Walking to the trail you go back behind the college on paved road, pass some houses and oil pumps.

All together, we did about 14 miles in 4 hours.There weren't many others on the trail-we saw two groups returning on our way in.

Got to the water fall, then did some scrambling up to the right of it using roots as ropes to get to the trail above the falls (vertigo look down over) that leads up to the punch bowls.  Left early so was mostly to myself.  It's a shame how much graffiti is all the way up.

Good trail for hiking but if you prefer a quieter hike where you don't have to worry about your safety at every corner I'd recommend trying somewhere else.

You can continue up Dreaded Hill to Mustard Rd or circle back around taking Whiting Rd back to the parking lot which is what we did. After making our way to the top of Dreaded Hill we were exhausted and ready to head back.

', ""I had a great time on this trail with my daughter. I'm 64 with bad knees and I  am a novice. I was more than 60 when we did a easy hike in Malibu that was hard for me. This time I used Montem trekking poles and it made all the difference! The balance the poles provided also gave me much more confidence.The trail is pretty. It is not flat and there are a few very rocky places. There is a gradual uphill over the first 1.5 miles. The last half mile or so was steep for me and very rocky. I did get to the end of the trail. My daughter did go through the Red Rock to the top. This is beyond the official end of the trail. Of course that is only the first half! Going back that last half mile is now a steep (at least to me) downhill but with the poles for balance it was doable. We did it including a couple of short breaks in about 3 hours.Things to consider: today and last few weeks have been dry. There were only 2 creeks with an inch of water. However there are numerous areas where there are creek beds. After a big rain this might not be so much fun. There are signs about mountain lions. Historically there have been incidents. Today all we saw were hikers and bikers and all were very friendly. Getting to the Parking Lot Google or Waze the Ralph's on Portola Pkwy.

Disability friendly-ish along Borrego, not Red Rock.  \n\nTRAIL FEATURES \nTry for late day lighting - better red rock pictures!"", 'Lots of wildlife and wildflowers. I saw Woodpeckers, deers, ducks, and gophers. $3 parking.', 'great trail. Red Rock canyon is well worth the hike to see', 'One way bike trail, limited paid parking ($3). Trail is very narrow, steep, rocky and sandy at times.', 'Great hike.. incredible views at the end of the trail.Moderate-intense elevation gain, a little rocky but overall the hike takes 3hrs round with kids, 4.4 miles.', 'Great trails for kids lots of bikers but at least they were friendly.', 'Parking- we chose to use the lot near the Ralphs on Portola & Market. The cost is $3 and the machine takes dollar bills and cards.\n\nTrail- we did the Borrego Trail which was great...green with shade and a little bit of water; Cattle Loop( I think) was too short to really say much about; Red Rock Trail which is a must-see with the reddish sandstone cliffs; Mustard Trail which was kinda boring; there are many other trails and there were hikers, runners, and bikers...no dogs allowed', 'Its a beautiful trail. We went with our 4 yr old and he enjoyed most of it. Quite shaded. The canyon itself is gorgeous. Would love to frequent it.', ""Super easy, very beautiful trail, follows a dry riverbed. Lots of birds and pretty plants. Rock formations are awesome and varied, make sure you climb some of them, if you'll manage to climb up to the top you get to enjoy even better views. Pretty scenic and super easy flat trail.\n\nBorrego Canyon trail is a biking trail, but Red Rock Canyon is hiking only."", 'I went hiking on Monday early morning. It actually was a bit crowded with bicycle riders.', 'Fun hike, really busy. Watch out for the mountain bikers, most don’t have bells. The red rocks were incredible! A must do.', 'Very crowded, they shouldn’t allow mountain bikers at peak dates and hours because of the big crowds. Easy trail, good for kids, nice views and climbing at the canyon.', 'Great little hike , great for pictures ! Very popular spot.', 'Ran this trail to the Red Canyon; very nice trail for beginners. Hot during the summers and not a lot of shade once you work your way towards the canyon. Bring lots of water', 'Great trail after you get past the initial intro hike to the actual “Red Rock Trail”. The hike is fairly easy, about 4.5 miles from the entrance, all the way through and back from the end trail point at Red Rock. The initial trek from entrance to the Red Rock Trail can be a little overwhelming with the amount of bicyclists riding back and forth. Nevertheless, we enjoyed the trail and there was plenty of wildlife to observe throughout the hike. The hike gets 4/5 stars solely based on the amount of bicyclists and the fact that dogs are NOT allowed. We would definitely frequent this trail if we are short on time and want to get a good hike on over the weekend.', 'Borrego is your starting point for many of the connecting trails. The trailhead for Red Rock can be a bit hard to find off Mustard, and is easily confused with Cattle Pond. Red Rock is a .5 mi single trail that is fairly easy and very much worth the hike.', 'Finally made it to the red rocks, easy trail. Hubby and I had a great time making this hike.', 'I like to see why people rate trails the way they do because it gives me an insight to what the trail is like. The trail is approximately 4.4 miles out and back, and is an easy trail. If you go on a busier day watch out for bicyclists. The trail starts off on a dirt path among a residential area. Then the dirt path becomes a path of sand in some areas. About a mile in you can’t see houses anymore. Make sure to grab a map at the trail head as there are other trails that connect to this one. If you don’t grab a map that’s ok because halfway up the trail there is another map posted and there are markers along the way to help you stay on the right path. We really enjoyed the hike because it was easy to hike with a one year old. The trail is nice, different and interesting because of the change from dirt to sand to red rock. It’s also clean. The only thing I didn’t like very much is having to share it with cyclists. Also, note that dogs are not allowed on this trail and that there is a $3 fee at the parking lot.', 'Entrance is gated off from where this map takes you, but up the hill about a minute there is a small white cement wall with a trail leading to dreaded hill peak. Beautiful to watch sunset! About a mile hike up, which was pretty easy. Beware of bikers and rattle snakes!', 'Gorgeous', 'One of my favorite trails in Orange County! Much of it is shaded by Coast Live Oak, Willow and Sycamore trees. The Red Rock Canyon is awesome.', 'This was a very fun trail. I love to climb so if you do to this was fun. I used Solomon trail running shoes my girlfriend went in regular old Nikes and we both did just fine.  Easy to follow trail, lots of shade and mountain bikers. No shade at the top of course but gorgeous red rock. Felt like being in Arizona again.', 'Great canyon views. Its an easy hike overall and if you go towards the canyons its a beautiful view looking back. did this hike back in spring', 'Great trail!', ""Extremely beautiful. The hike from the parking lot till the point you turn into the Red Rock trial is shady with lots of trees. Once you reach the Red Rock trail there's is few trees for the next mile or so. Definitely worth it."", 'Heavily populated point to point trail.  Watch out for poison oak.', ""July 2017Defiently warmer weather around this time. Second time here, total 7.10 miles. From the lot, took it up straight, hung a left up another trail to reach the dead end with a nice bench, gives you a lovely view of red rock and the city. Back down hang a left and walk the creek which is all rock. Take it all the way and you'll hit your destination. Be warned, there are many MANY snakes!"", 'The trail gets blurry at times, but awesome when you make it to the red rocks!', 'Magnificent views! This is a ""must-do"" trail!', ""Super fun hike, challenging at times but nothing crazy. When you get to a fork in the road the sign points to the left, but is only a slight left. don't go up the huge hill, that's the wrong path. gorgeous rocks back there, a cool sight to see."", ""Love this trail. It's easy and I enjoy both walking and running this trail. No dogs allowed on the trail and you'll share the trail with mountain bikers. Most are courteous and will alert you. I had fun and will do this trail several more times."", 'Excellent trail! Located in Whiting Ranch south orange county California, this is an easy 4.2 mile hike. Terrain is gorgeous!', 'DONE! ; )', ""Take Borrego all the way to the fork (about 2 miles in), then head right to start on Mustard trail. Soon after, keep your eye out for a slightly covered sign to Red Rock Canyon. The sign is slightly hidden on the left after the picnic bench. Easy hike, rocky narrow trail to Red Rock and wow it's beautiful. Be careful if you choose to climb around once you arrive. It's sandy and slippery."", 'Nice easy family hike. The kids enjoyed it, saw lots of butterflies & of course the red rock formation at the end was awesome.', 'This was a very nice shady hike.', 'Nice hike for my first one in a while. Only saw 2 snakes and a whole bunch of lizards.Perfect weather. Good hike for a nice day.', 'This was the first real hike I took my 7 year old daughters on. They loved it! It\'s quite rocky and I\'m a little nervous to try any trail other than easy with them. This was ""easy"" but still had some tough spots to get through.  We missed it twice, once going too left and getting onto a loop trail and once going too right and ending up on Mustard Rd.  The kids loved the small loop so much we did it twice!', 'Did this hike with my company. Easy to hike and carry on conversations. Not hard to do. Nice views since we went after the rains. Streams were flowing over. Everything was green. Lots of shade. Mt bikers share the path with you to red rock canyon . Not a pet friendly trail. Good hike to take the family on. Rewarding view at the end when you reach this beautiful rock of nature. Will do this one again.', 'Awesome hike, very cool terrain that is not expected.', ""Did this hike last night. The recent rains have washed out the trail pretty good once you get to the end of the Borrego Canyon Trail and start on the Red Rock Canyon Trail. The trail has seen severe erosion and more than a foot of dirt has been washed away leaving small boulders that make going slow and the trip a little more challenging for your ankles. The lowering of the trail leaves little room for passing opposite traffic. The Red Rocks themselves don't seem affected by the erosion though and are still quite a sight, I'd still recommend the hike just go in knowing it will be a little more challenging than normal."", 'My 3.5 year old, 7 year old, husband and I completed this hike. It was a few weeks after the rain so a bit muddy in places, but fun! We packed our lunch and ate on the red rocks and then headed back. With little legs it took us close to 4 hours with a short lunch stop round trip. We all thoroughly enjoyed it!', 'Nice hike, very easy to get through and plenty of nice scenic spots. Met plenty of fellow hikers on the way. There was a gate that said the path was closed, but people went anyway (might have been temporarily closed). The pay station was broken, so I just parked at the nearby Ralphs. It was muddy and a bit rocky when I went. The red rocks were worth the trek.', ""Initially it's very easy with very little incline. There's a few little side trails you can go on which are unmarked. It can be mildly dangerous because of all the rocks. At the end of the trail, it dumps you into this cool rock formation but you can also go and climb up to the top of other ones. I climbed up onto a ridge beside the creek and had a great view of the valley. It's relatively short and kid-friendly. You can also avoid paying for parking by parking at the supermarket but you didn't here it from me!"", 'Mostly a nature walk through a canyon. The very end is the only slightly technical part of the hike. Great hike for beginners, kids, elderly, etc. surprised by the red rocks in Orange County!', 'it was beautiful trekking trailbut little to easy trail', ""Hands down my favorite hike I've been on since I moved from Utah to Orange County! The trail to the red rocks is gentle with lots of trees and lots of shade, and the red rocks themselves are uniquely aesthetic and fun to climb. Very reminiscent of the red rocks of my home state. I will definitely be coming back here!"", 'Fairly straightforward neighborhood hike with little elevation gain. Terrain is extremely sandy during the dry summer months and rocky throughout most sections. This is one of the more shaded hikes in Orange County. Great morning/afternoon hike destination (~1.5 - 3 hrs). Great view of the red rock canyon at the end. Fairly straightforward to navigate - Borrego up, right on Mustard, left onto Red Rock immediately after turning on Mustard.', ""Fairly challenging hike, I enjoyed the red rocks at the end, but it's at the very very end of the trail."", 'Fun hike. Make sure when you turn left at the first red rock sign that you immediately stay to the right or you miss the trail', ""Great trail for the most part. Shady at parts of trail were welcomed.  Did get a little rocky as we got closer to the red rock canyon seemed like we were hiking through what would be a creek bed. End of the trail was closed so couldn't go all the way.  Although we are novice hikers including my nine year old with Down syndrome, we had a great time."", 'Not a challenging hike, but rewarding when you get to the end.I added it as part of a longer hike, and found it to be a nice diversion from the Billy Goat and Vista Outlook.', 'Pretty easy hike, mostly flat with some sand along the way. The canyon at the end is pretty cool and Sedona-esque. Climb some rocks in the canyon and have a lunch. $3 parking', ""Scenery was beautiful and the canyon itself was cool. The hike was around 4 miles round trip and wasn't too difficult. Highly recommend this hike!"", 'Great family hike / off and on sun and shade.', 'Borrego Canyon portion is mostly flat, shady in the morning, highly trafficked by mountain bikes. Red Rock Canyon portion is for hikers only - narrower trail and a little steeper. Nice views of Red Rock formations at the end of the trail.', 'Completed the 4.4 Mustard trail with four and seven year-old kids .  It was perfect!  Lots of shade and the best part is you can take the kids for frozen yogurt across the street when you are done! Also, a few places for the kids to rest and snack along the way.   You can see and hear lots of acorn woodpeckers.  Would definitely go back without the kids to do the longer, Vista trail that goes uphill for views of the city.', 'Great hike today!', ""Easy hike, mostly flat. Good for kids, lots of shady areas. There are a lot of mountain lion sightings but I've never had a problem.  Watch out for bikers of you have kids with you. $3 parking or park for free at adjacent shopping center."", 'A fun and easy hike to beautiful red rock sandstone. Go early to avoid the crowds.\n\nI have full turn-by-turn directions to the red rocks on my blog:\nhttps://hikingguy.com/hiking-trails/whiting-ranch-wilderness-park-hike-red-rock-canyon/', 'I walked this trail yesterday and with the recent rains we have had it was gorgeous!  Fields of grass, small streams and marshes, tons of birds and 3 bee hives (I could only see one, but I heard three).   I only encountered a handful of people, one of the benefits of hiking midweek.', 'Very busy with views of the surrounding neighborhood. Despite this, it is still very pretty with opportunities to bird watch.', ""amazing view at the top, best trail I've been on so far"", 'We loved this hike.  We started at the trailhead near Market Place St and headed out from lower Borrego Canyon.  This is very busy with mountain bikers since this seems to the the starting point for them to get out to all the other trails.  It is the start of a one-way cyclist trail, so watch out for the bikers.  You can usually hear them coming so just stand off to the side.  Very one we saw was very pleasant and thanked us for moving over.  The trail is very shaded with beautiful trees along the way.  At the end of Borrego Canyon trail, we took the Mustard Trail a very short distant to meet up with the Red Rock Canyon Trail.  We almost missed it since there was a group of hikers relaxing at a picnic table.  Then we continued out to Red Rock Canyon to the end of the trail.  Very beautiful Red Rock Canyon.  After resting for a short time we headed back the same way.  This was a very easy and enjoyable trail.

Besides that, there are not many surprises.', 'Great middle distance run.', 'The Stanford Dish is a challenging walk.  We enjoy doing a stroll there in the evenings.  It can be very crowded, and hot (little to no shade).  There are rolling hills.', ""Don't even try to park on Stanford Ave on weekends. There are other entrances to the park, notably one at Foothill and Campus Loop. Parking on the university campus is abundant and in most places not restricted on weekends.\n\nThe trail has almost no shade - prepare enough water."", 'This is a very good hike centrally located for many in the south bay and peninsula. It has very nice views of the surrounding area and makes for a good morning hike. However, the sheer number of a people on the trail in a major drawback. Its hard to  get away from the hustle and bustle of society when there are hundreds, if not thousands, of people on the trail on a weekend morning. I would probably go back, but its not my first choice for hiking.', 'Awesome trail! Great for new hikers. Gets a bit crowded, go early!', 'Use the entrance off Alpine Road. Adds about 2 miles to the loop hike.', 'Great hike for a cool day.', 'It was a great easy trail. A good starter trail. Great view and just very relaxing.', 'Great hike close to Palo Alto. Kicks your butt if not used to hills. Downside is finding parking at peak hours.', ""Paved, clean, populated. This is good for people that like to hike or run alone because there's ALWAYS people. Parking is tough....lots of people. I do like this place for an easy hour walk close to home. There's great views and the trail is wide and open. Check it out for yourself."", 'Moderate, 4 mile loop, lots of hills, sunny, paved, walking, running, strollers, safe, lots if people. Good to do in the morning or cooler months. Its a great loop if need to do training on hills. Downside is trying to find parking, street parking and limited lot parking. Just plan that it will take a while to find a spot. ', 'Went to try this one today thinking it would be an ""easy, flat"" ride as other sites have indicated. WRONG!! Lots of climbing. Nothing too crazy grade-wise, but we hadn\'t brought any water thinking it would be a fast loop. We had to turn back about 1/3 of the way in as it was a hot, dusty day.\n\nThis ""trail"" is also - from what we saw - a bike path on the side of Sand Hill / Alpine Road. \n\nI would not take beginner cyclists here, it would totally overwhelm them. \n\nI will return to conquer you, Stanford Loop!! Next time with water and maybe earlier in the day.\n\nOn the plus side, downtown Palo Alto is within biking distance. We very much enjoyed a stroll around downtown after we gave up on the Loop.', ""@Trailking: Bikes are prohibited and so are dogs. Unfortunately (in my opinion at least) the rules are a bit strict at the Dish. You can't even go off trail for more than 10 meters before an official comes and summons you back on trail. A friend of mine who has lived in the area for more than 50 years told me that (obviously) this trail was very different when he was a kid: everyone could go where they wanted, and there was a network of trails (as opposed to one paved loop that exists today). \n\nStill, the Dish is a great loop for  run, or family hike. I still go there almost every week."", 'This guide has great information. It almost looks as if bikes could be ridden on some portions of the route.

Moderate difficulty only due to its length, otherwise a very easy walk. A couple parts are meh due to having to walk on roads / near campsites, but the vast majority of the trail is beautiful. Cold in Winter so bring something warm, and the lake level is low right now, which gives it an eerie kind of beauty. Highly recommend!', 'I hiked this trail three times. It is moderate hike. Beautiful views in different seasons. Waterfall at the end of pan handle area is wonderful mid point break. East side trail narrower and more shadowy than west side. Enjoy.', 'Took our dogs with us on this hike.  Fairly easy.  Was adequately marked except when we had to walk in the road.', 'A spectacular 8.5 mile loop trail, generally well shaded, around an alpine lake.  Parking is available on Mormon Emigrant Trail for a $5 self-pay day use fee. If you park inside the park (entry is just east of the cut off for Emigrant Trail), the day use fee is $13, but you can get a park / trail map at the entry station. The trail is decently marked at most places.  A couple parts of the loop, especially down by the dam, force you onto roads where you’re competing with cars. Lake levels are down a bit, which lets you trim a mile or so off of the full distance at the upstream end of the lake if you stray from the trail a bit and brave some mud flats. We’ll be back:  this one’s going on the regular rotation.', 'This was a great hike. We did it in early spring, it rained just a bit the last 1/2 mile and there were snow flurries by the time we got to the car.', 'Beautiful hike, liked the shade of the trees and being near the water. Has some steep spots but mainly easy trail. Lots of friendly hikers and mountain bikers on trail.', 'Had a great time camping lake side for two days. the second day did the hike to the waterfall and it was not running. kind of a disappointment. but beautiful park and camp grounds!!!!!! the only other thing was all the hornets. made cooking breakfast a bit challenging, but they where all gone by dusk.

My suggestion is to park along Emigrant Trail near the 2nd dam (parking option 3 shown on the map) and take the lake clockwise.  You have to walk through some camp areas but it never felt intrusive.  Not a ton of signage, but if you are not sure which way to go just take the path that keeps you along the lake.', 'Had a great hike to the waterfall.', ""We went on a Saturday (got there at 8am) and found parking pretty easily ($5). Luckily a ranger was there and gave us a map because this trail isn't well marked. You go through a few campgrounds. It was loud most of the trail. We either heard cars or the large amount of people on the lake. We had to move often for other hikers (large groups). The waterfall was VERY crowded. If you are looking for a trail that's peaceful and relaxing this is not the trail for you. It's closer to 10 miles as well. The trail itself is good for all fitness levels I would say."", 'Even though listed mileage is 7.6 miles our hike once around plus the side route to the waterfall and back was over 9 miles according to my GPS.  Nice single path trail with easy footing.  Shade most of the way.  Restrooms along the way.  Dog friendly as they can drink from the lake the whole way.  The waterfall is worth seeing.', 'Gentle, well-shaded hike. I would also suggest entering at the southeast entrance off of Mormon Emigrant Trail and heading to the waterfall and back. This route is much more serene and less congested than doing the full loop; the north and west sides of the lake have many campsites and considerably more people.', 'This hike around the lake is easily accomplished in around 3-4 hours depending on your pace. I would rate this hike as an easy day trip. You will need water, sun screen, and comfortable shoes. There are restrooms and the trail is close to the lake the duration of the hike. This hike is full of great scenery. I would suggest hiking the eastern side of the lake starting from the main entrance and turning around from the waterfall, instead of doing the full loop. This side of the lake is less congested, offers the most shade, and you can track a 10 mile hike this way instead of 8 miles. The waterfall is big and has a swimming hole at the bottom. I found a rope swing along the way and plenty of fishing spots. There are benches to take lunch breaks along the hike and make sure you are cautious for snakes. I almost stepped on one this second time around.', 'beautiful trail with dogwoods for a bunch of different kinds of flowers blooming.

I didn't do the whole 7 miles but enjoyed it."", 'Rad trail, plenty of shade, cool waterfall, lots of water access. Serene and quiet.', 'A few parking spaces right off the road, plus a lot just a couple hundred feet up. $5 fee, bathrooms and trash cans.', 'One of my all time favorite locations for all types of outdoor recreational activities. This place is loved and very well maintained. I’ve Kayaked, hiked nine miles of trails around the lake, biked, watched Eagles, geese and camped. From the well maintained trails, to restrooms and staff, I’ve always enjoyed this location.', 'We camped here last weekend and decided after setting up cap to hike around the lake- FYI this hike is closer to 9 miles. We are both in great shape and It took us a long time, but the trail is flat and every angle of the lake is beautiful. There is a waterfall along the trail that is gorgeous! We will definitely come back in the summer when we can get in the lake.', 'Awesome lake. You can swim in it all of summer. Sometimes there is a waterfall depending on rainfall. Overall great place to trail run, walk, or hike. Good camping too!', 'This is not a difficult trail it’s about 9 Miles from the campground to complete the loop. Some areas you’ll have to walk on the street others past the campgrounds and picnic areas. The waterfall is gushing this year. If you have 3-4 hours to spare this is a nice hike with great views of the lake.', 'It is a beautiful view. Don’t listen to the 7.7 miles it’s more like 10 miles but it’s fine still a nice view. My aunt went with me she was 8 months pregnant it was really easy for her.', 'If you’re doing the loop just know you’re going to have to walk on the street for like a half mile to get back to where you parked. It’s closer to 9 miles. The real scoop... the west side of the loop, the long side, is interrupted by several camp sights. So it’ll be awesome and then you’ll walk the huge camp sights and finding the trail and getting back on track can be a pain. The east side, around a mile shorter, is amazing. Great trail. Ups and downs. My gf and I enjoyed it a lot. The waterfall is awesome. You have to walk past the bridge, can’t miss it, and you’ll approach it. We sat and had our lunch here. For a man-made waterfall is amazing. Still beautiful and would go back to see it any time, but would only hike the east side and not do the loop.', 'Nice and pretty easy hike. It’s beautiful and this time of year, not many people on the trail.', 'This is a nice mellow ride with a lot of great views. I recommend going counter clockwise around the lake. make sure to stop and check out the water fall near the East part of the lake called the meadows area. There is a lot of pine needles on the camping side of the lake.There a couple of Free to Park areas that are very small and a couple of $5 day use parking areas outside of the main gates. Just ask about them at the entrance of the lake.', 'Great peaceful hike. Spotted two bald eagles. Including a baby.', ""Don't get me wrong with the three stars. It's pretty and well maintained. It's also very convenient location wise. Without having to drive at least an extra half hour more, this was as woodsy of an outing I was going to get of a hike in El Dorado that I saw right off the highway. It's a GREAT place for kids and larger families. If you're looking for quiet and less people around this is not your place. Almost never had a clear photo shot without a human, auto or boat, or man made something in the shot. It was also kind of noisy with lots of talking and loud machinery on the north side. Even the waterfall is not natural it seems. The trail around the lake also makes you go on the paved road for quit a while which was a bit of a bummer. There was a bit more trash than I could pick up while walking but honestly for the amount of people that use this area I am surprised how clean it is.  I also think $12 for day use for a regular car is very high. I'll make sure to push to go out a little further next time."", 'North side of the lake isn’t well marked but south side is. Great views and good hike for older kids.', 'great hike one day AFTER it rained no dust on the trail lots of bathrooms along the  8 mile trail water fall was flowing strong', 'Only did southern part of lake but beautiful, well shaded, and even got some fall colors', 'Great trail around a uniquely shaped lake. The southeast corner of the lake is definitely the most scenic stretch for fall colors during this time of year. Lost the trail at the end and went over the two damns on the road which was only downfall, but would go back!', ""Couldn't figure out an exact trail. I recommend going across the freeway away from the lake and exploring the forest area. Steep downhill but fun hike. Beware of horse poop!"", ""The hike around the Jenkinson lake is fairly easy and has beautiful views! Yes, there are a few steep locations, but if you go slow then the slope isn't too bad. Be aware of bikers on the trail though. The chimney area makes for a great location to go for a swim. The water isn't too cold. My Fitbit clocked me at about 9 Miles, but my cousin somehow got about 10.1 miles. \n\nMap: http://www.webreserv.com/catalog/ eldoradoirrigationdistrictca/images/sly _park_brochure_16031700002.jpg"", 'great hike, great views!', '', ""We parked at the entrance of the park and started on the trail counter clockwise.

Next time we'll look for a closer parking to the trail."", ""We hiked the south side of Lake to falls. Well maintained trail that's almost all shade. The falls were really nice. Plenty of spots to stop and enjoy the lake."", 'we loved it.  we went clockwise which means you go through all the campgrounds first and then after the waterfalls you have the private area the private part of the hike the second half is a lot more up and down Hills so if I did it again I would go counter-clockwise and it is longer than 7.7 we clocked in around 8.8.', ""I feel like I am pretty picky when it comes to trails, but I really enjoyed this one. I am even willing to go back and would like to go ahead and do the stroll around the lake.\nI brought my out of shape dog and my friend who isn't used to hiking. We started at the Bumpy Meadows Trailhead (vaulted toilets and $5). The realistic goal for my dog and friend was to get to the waterfall and go back (6 miles).\n We got a late start, so I started off pretty peeved. Then, just a short jaunt down to the water and some disrespectful humans left a man made fire ring AND a pack of uneaten burritos, which my dog managed to get a bite out of before I got them away.\nEven though we started late, there really wasn't many people. There was shade the majority of the trail. There was a lot of mosquitos, so bring bug spray, I only got bitten 11 times (that is a pretty low count for me). \nThe water was a beautiful green blue and so deliciously cool. The rocks weren't slippery, so off the shoes went and I was able to get in there and set up my tripod. :)\nIt was a really peaceful hike. I was happily surprised how many people had their dogs on leashes, most trails require this, but I rarely see people follow it. \nReally the only disappointment was all the trash that I saw."", 'Great Hike!  My friend and I took our kids (7 children-all under 10 years old) and they did great!  The trail was easy enough to follow, with minimal hills.  We passed a few mountain bikers and horseback riders along the way, all of which were very kind and patient with our little hiking group!  The waterfall was beautiful and refreshing and the kids loved exploring the entire area.', 'I do this hike and run this trail a lot. I love it. Plenty of shade and not to hard going', 'Nice, easy, mostly shaded hike.', ""They say this is moderate and damn is it right. I spent most of the time scrambling uphill and downhill. That's IF you go to the left at the start. 3.6 miles of it. When you see the bridge , go right and you will see a magnificent waterfall that makes it all worth it . Climb to the top for a gorgeous view or go to the bottom and swim the heat away.Now the return trip. It's low so it's nice. Keep taking the low path. For the love of god keep the low path. Soon you'll get to a camp site and think nothing of it. And keep going. Well, you're going the wrong way. You have to go through the camp site (stock up on water) and jump on the road. The road is the rest of the trail. Remember left on Lakewood drive. And then you'll hit a parking lot. At this moment take the trail in the woods for .1 miles and boom. Home freeMy trail stops short because battery is dying. I was out that long. Five stars Edit : the road is winding. Take the right path, or take the left path down and the right path up"", ""Such a beautiful hike. Started bright and early at 7:30am and went clockwise around the lake. It was marked fairly well but there were a few spots that were a bit confusing. If you stay to the trails closest to the lake you are good to go. I did have to create my own path back to my car, which was parked in the few visitor spots by the park entrance, after I went past the boat launch. I'm not sure how I could have gotten up there other than to walk along the highway next time? So I walked up a hill over where they had cut down trees. Other than that it was gorgeous and very few people on the trails. Watch for mountain bikers. I did also get just over 9 miles on my watch."", 'Loved this hike! Hiked the entire lake, loved the view. Liked the back side for the hike better than having to hike through the campsites. Got confused a couple times on which way we were supposed to go. Even though there are signs every where. Live an hour away and would love to do this hike once a week. We had a wonderful time.', 'Love this trail', 'By far my most favorite hike so far. Scenery was amazing, a moderately challenging hike, clean air, wildlife, people laughing and having fun on the lake and a waterfall! I did not go on the north side due to the high volume of campers.', ""This hike is about 9.5 miles around Jenkinson Lake.  \n\nIt is mostly flat, so not very difficult.   It took us about 4.5-5 hours including a 30-minute lunch at the waterfall. We are slow hikers and it was a very hot day (high approximately 90 degrees).\n\nThe trail is about 3/4 shaded with short stretches in the unprotected sun. Bring a hat and plenty of sunblock.  We did not encounter problems with bugs, but we used spray as a preventative measure.\n\nThe trail is well-marked.  We parked near the second dam and started on the south shore. You don't need to park in the recreation area lot (it costs $5 or $10). We figured the sun would be less harsh if we started on the south, then finished on the north side.  \n\nThe south side is beautiful and peaceful. We encountered some mountain bikers who were friendly throughout the trail.  The waterfall (man made) on the eastern edge of the lake was thunderous from the late snowmelt this year.  It is safe to jump in the water and cool off, but it is crowded by the falls with people picnicking/camping near Lake Jenkinson.\n\nThe north side is less peaceful as you have to walk through day-use areas and walk on pavement for stretches.  It's crowded and less protected from the sun.  There is a really nice stretch on the north side near the western edge of the lake with trees - a welcome relief after the crowds and noise from the lake.\n\nComing from Sacramento, this is a hike that is easy to access, but the lake is crowded with people boating/playing in the lake.  People blast their radios on the shore and lake, so it isn't exactly peaceful.  Unless you really want to do the whole loop, you might want to do an out-and-back to the falls and stick to the south side for a little more quiet.  Or, you may want to picnic for the day on the north side and do the hike as part of your day.\n\nI posted some photos throughout the trail on my recording (which has a gap when I shutoff my recorder accidentally). I also posted some nice photos that I took under Photos."", '9.5 mile loop around Jenkinson lake-NOT 7.7 miles. Gorgeous and highly recommend it. Moderate difficulty.', 'Beautiful loop on lake shore, the only down part that is not making that hike a 4 stars is that we crossed campgrounds and some roads a t the beginning.

Left from the 2nd dam and walk counter clockwise.  This side is much nicer.  Falls were full.  On the other side of the lake you have to walk through several campgrounds.

Sweet hike and very nice campground as well.', 'Great trail to hike! Go clockwise around the lake well covered but get there early if you want free street parking there are spots between the boat launch and the damn but not much. Also the later in the morning to after noon it gets kind of busy with kids and mountain bikers. One of the better trails i have been on it says 7.7 miles but it was more like 8.5.

Lots to see the lake is pretty nice also lots of places to swim.', 'Beautiful lake', ""Amazing hike… There were a few obstructions in the path because they're cutting some trees and doing some burn areas… But otherwise it was absolutely picturesque.  Most of the path is it least two people wide, and most of it is a great mostly flat walking area… There are a few ups and down climbs towards the end"", 'the South side of the lake is great...opposite side has a ton of trees down...and campsites break up the trail...pretty cool overall.', ""Great hike around Jenkinson Lake. Started outside the park entrance past the second dam, parked on the side of Mormon-Emigrant Trail, Silver Lake Road. This starting point provides access to the trail at the Southmost point of the lake, without actually passing through the entrance gate. This is fine for hiking only, but if you want to put in a boat or kayak, you're better off paying the entrance fee and getting access right at the water's edge. Looped the lake counterclockwise, stopping at Hazel Creek (waterfall) but it wasn't going. Darn!!Stopped for lunch at Pinecone campgrounds, where they were doing some work trimming and taking out trees. Pit toilet restrooms are plentiful along the North and West sides of the lake where all the campgrounds are. The South and East sides are wilder and lack facilities. They were also doing work along the Scout Hill campsites. The trail here was completely blocked by felled trees and we had to climb over and around them. The lake is beautiful. Will come back to kayak in the near future. Great hike. A must do, if you're in the area."", 'Gorgeous! This trail nearly hugs the entire lake. We will go back in the very near future!', ""I hiked the Jenkinson Lake Loop Trail on 19/MAR/2017. It took me about three hours to complete it. The trail was beautiful with the exception of about a 100 foot portion of the hike where the trail disappeared where they are doing construction. I parked on the road about 300 feet after turning onto Mormon Emigrant Trail Road. If you don't park on the street then you will need to pay $5 for parking. There were a decent amount of people out on the trail, but I wouldn't consider it crowded. I passed another hiker about every 10 minutes. There are a lot of campsites in the area, so there is a road that is a perimeter to the lake as well as the trail. For a very short portion it was necessary to walk on the road to continue the trail. Like me, many other people had their dogs with them. If you are not a dog person, then you may want to choose another location to hike as we met about 40-45 other dogs. The scenery was beautiful and the weather was great at about 64 degrees and partly cloudy. There is hardly any elevation change as the trail is bordering the lake. I would consider this hike relatively easy to complete. There were about 5 groups of mountain bikers that passed us during our hike and did not interfere in any way, but the trail is not wide at most points, so we would just step aside while they passed. Overall I thought it was a great hike. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because there was one portion of the trail where they are cutting down a bunch of trees and the trail disappears forcing you to walk over logs, brush, and tree bark which forced me to pick up my dog and carry her through it."", 'Got dark have way threw but was still completed very nice', 'Easy hike. About 9 miles all the way around. Beautiful hike', 'A great walk around the lake.', 'Went on this hike 3 days ago and it was great.

Overall good footing, and we saw a river otter last week.', 'Went off season mid week and had the trail to ourselves.

The trail is well maintained and very easy to follow with water stations along the way.  Next time, I will bring my kayak too.', 'It was a fun easy fast hike back to the waterfall in the back. Was able to bring my family with me which made the experience more fun. The waterfall was very cold but refreshing. The hike was made fun since we would stop part way through to take a dip the the warm lake water.', ""Great trail, easy to follow. Next time I'll stay on the more southern side and do and out and back at the bridge since the other side has lots of people and campers and loudness. Nice, mostly shaded trail that I will definitely be doing again."", 'Parts of the trail are enjoyable but we were mistaken in hoping for a more serene lake experience. Sections of the trail include asphalt roads through or around campsites and walking along relatively busy roads with little clearance. Always nice to hop in the lake at multiple locations and dog-friendly is always a plus.', 'Beautiful trail. The kiddos and I enjoyed this one. At the end of our hike we took a dip in the water.', ""The hike around the Jenkinson lake is fairly easy and has beautiful views! Yes, their are a few steep locations, but if you go slow then the slope isn't too bad. Be aware of bikers on the trail though. The chimney area makes for a great location to go for a swim.

Cute wooden footbridges and blackberry bushes added interest to the trail.', 'Trailhead to Muir Beach via Fox (steep) to Coyote to Green Gulch ( beautiful and high, the path winds down to Zen garden (part of Marin Organic) and on to Muir. Coastal Trail back (10mi)', 'A little uneventful', 'Get there early for parking. Nice beginner hike while offers other options for climbing.', 'Perfect with kids. Paved most of the way.', ""If you stay on the easy path, it's not much of a hike (which is totally ok!) but more of a nice, scenic stroll. The scenery is actually quite beautiful, and I went with a friend when it was a little foggy out. The huge rocks and cliffs were amazing to look at. Spills out right to the beach, then you just go back onto the trail."", '10 out of 10 would hike again.', 'Had a great time out on this hike!1st time we ever went, found gem on this app!! thank you! it was a  Easy path to take the kids! today we were lucky was able to see a seal, dolphins and beautiful views!!', 'Just completed this trail yesterday and I would say \'all that I could have asked for myself\' on that beautiful day! Had a feeling of content. (You know, the kind of which doesn\'t come easy.)It was supposed to be rainy day and it did pour! But even in that weather, the trail had a good number of hikers, trail-runners, bikers; which was a big surprise!The trail is quite flat and easy as everyone have mentioned, which quickly leads to the Gorgeous views of the ocean and stone-formations. The beach itself seems to be a work-of-art, a painters imagination! Lost track of time just standing there and watching the waves and listening to the ocean.There is also a little extra hike to a spot which is overlooking the Tennessee Beach from a height. If you and your group have the time, I would recommend this part as well. But be careful at the very top. Though the view is breathtaking but  there is Not a lot of room up their. So you have to be cautious of the edges while taking those  pictures/videos.Also took a detour and went to visit the ""Pirates\' Cove"". The name is completely justified! It\'s a little hidden from the trail and the path leading to it is a bit steep & tricky. I did slip and fell on my way down because of all the rain & mud. Check that out on YouTube- http://youtu.be/Vls2Rnot8js . But the cove was worth the effort & pain! Instantly gave the feeling of being secluded, untamed, uninhibited, wildly beautiful.', ""Super easy and pretty walk down to a beach. I like to get a large coffee and just stroll down and back. Wide paths, so the crowds aren't bad. You can easily walk around slower traffic."", 'Beautiful scenery... Easy or moderate depending on trail you take.', ""Easy trail to the beach. This time of year a bit dry and crowded on a Friday afternoon.  But the beach is beautiful!  Beautiful ocean and rock formations alongside the trail and at the oceans edge. Unfortunately today there were two Dead Sea lions and about six dead seagulls. Don't know why -sad."", 'Easy and beautiful.', 'Awesome trail. Great views from the beach.', 'Great hike for beginners and bikers.  Love the cloud cover since it basically rolls right over your head as you hike.  Traffic into the area was kind of bad but expected since it was a holiday.', 'It was fun.Good place for beginner mountain bikers.', 'Perfect hike for all ages. Just under four miles. Stroller-accessible. Lots of opportunities to spot wildlife. Beware of sneaker waves on the beach, especially during the fall and winter months.', 'Beautiful views, easy hike that my little kids could handle. Very little shade. Bathrooms about 1 mile down. Will definitely do again!', 'Nice easy hike with some good views and great bird watching.', 'Great easy hike to the beach! Lots of sparrows and wrens, and great views of kestrels and owls if you are lucky! The wetlands offer views of mergansers and scaups. The beach is pretty and sunsets are picturesque! Just get past the somewhat uneventful beginning paved road and veer right to the beach trail!', 'Grew up going here, the hike in the valley is beautiful and easy/flat. You end up at a small beach which is typically overcast but very charming. If you want something more challenging and with stunning ocean views the hike from Tennessee to Muir Beach is probably more your speed.', 'This trail is an easy hike. The beach at the end is great! However, if u go on a foggy day it can be pretty windy on the upper part of the trail and cold at the beach. Go when the tide is 0 or negative and u can boulder on the rocks to the left of the trail outlet.There are signs posted all around for no dogs, but I saw several. ', ""This Trail is right next to my Computer Company Office (http://www.4Directions.biz) so I get to ride and hike it almost every day (especially if I am fixing a Computer and there's at least an hour of copying to do). Very easy and pleasant. I've seen lots of Hawks, a bobcat, foxes, etc...  So come to Mill Valley and enjoy our beautiful nature!"", 'This is an easy but enjoyable trail with lots of wild flowers.  The best thing is when you come to the breathtaking vista of the beach at the end.  Great spot for photography. ', ""This was very enjoyable.  Easy walk that started out wide & paved.  Good for strollers, etc.  More difficult trails are accessible from both the trail head and from the straight, easy path to a beautiful beach of black sand!  The trail follows a stream on its' journey to the ocean.  Be careful at high tide or you may get stuck on the beach for a few hours!

Great choice for a first day and super refreshing to feel the most from the falls spraying up at you. *bring a poncho or rain jacket if you do not want to get wet.', 'A nice easy trail if that is what you are looking for, and spectacular falls. Good for the whole family, best in the springtime.', 'Quick and easy trail. 100% worth the time and effort. You can get soaked on a hot day if you like, or just get some awesome photos of the base of the fall', 'I went on March 19 and it was a delight, with snow still on the ground. Slippery in parts of the paved trail, so it’s better sometimes to go off the trail just a little bit and clamber up and down. Excellent atmosphere, filled with spray from the falls and the roar of the water when you get to the top of the trail.', 'Awesome Trail , went with my 7 yr old. it was so icy and dangerous when we went. \nMy son loves it , but i had to slide down to the trail on the ice yet it was Fantastic', 'Short and sweet, just the way it was meant to be. Pretty cool in the rain. They’re going to be renovating the trail soon, to make it more accessible and crowd-friendly, better bathrooms, better parking lot, etc.', '', 'If you want to see a waterfall but are short on time, this is one to see. Best time to go is in the spring/early summer when the snow is melting.', 'Very easy paved trail, great views of the fall.', 'Nice, short trail to get you to the falls.  It’s fairly crowded but has some nice sights along the way.', 'Excellent introductory view of the park.  The best part is scrambling up as far as possible for better views of the falls / rainbows.  There is an adjacent waterfall if you walk laterally after scaling up 150 feet or so, with a cave that you can enter for cooler views and pictures.  Technical climb for rock scrambling which is moderate-difficult.', ""Good simple walk on a paved path. Not too many people when we went. The end of the path affords amazing views of the falls above. I went off trail and rock scrambled to the base of the fall, which is about another 230 feet elevation. This is very technical, and though many tried, only a few got as high at the fall. Take care, since this is a dangerous change in skill and not for everyone. Skill change on the trail goes from Green, to Single Black here. Need to take care on that part,  remember that every rock is water polished smooth-so it is very slick. About half way up, the water mist makes every rock slippery..  And the obvious way up or down, isn't always the right way."", 'Super short walk to the beautiful falls, works great as a stop during a scenic drive, but there are so many people doing the same thing. The parking lot here has bathrooms and water.', 'Short hike with nice waterfall. worth a quick look as you drive through the valley', 'Beautiful ! Larger than lower Yosemite falls Depends on the time of year I guess', ""The waterfalls in this season seem to have dwindled down quite a bit since my last month's visit but it is still in every way impressive! \n\nThis spot is very heavily trafficked mid day. The most difficult part of this trail was finding parking!! \n\nAfter a quick half a mile trot towards the fall, you will have the option to either take some photos from a distance or rock scramble over to the base of the falls for another half mile. The part is technical and can require decent shoes for good footing. I took off my flip flops and felt like I had an advantage doing so. \n\nIf you choose to take it a step further and go all the way to the first tier drop, the area is mostly secluded because it's even more dangerous to go this direction. I suspect you can't come to this area after a good rainy season because the fall would be too massive to stand close by. \n\nOther than having to deal with people, I'm still in love with this place! It takes nothing to walk to and needs to be a part of everyone's visit."", 'Lovely fall and easy walk on paved path.', ""Super easy. If you want to get close to the big water fall you have to do some climbing and make your own path. If there's a lot of people it makes it more challenging to dodge them."", ""It's not much of a hike, more of a walk to a very picturesque falls. Arrive before 8 to avoid the stampede."", 'Really fun! We climbed the rocks and went up pretty high! Would not recommend without proper shoes and equipment becuz the rocks are slippery!', 'There were so many people on this trail/walk!', 'Neat to see the waterfall so close!', 'Very short hike - very little parking - we went by 3 times and couldnt find a space however if you go real early - you are fine.  I think the views of the waterfall are actually better from the main road as opposed to under the waterfall itself', ""lots of fun scurrying up the rocks to the waterfall. it's very easy and paved for the first bit, but when you leave the path and start up on the slippery rocks it becomes much more challenging and fun!"", '', 'Easy and beautiful trail. Good for all age and skill levels. Wear a raincoat!', 'Easy. Got soaking wet', ""Half mile, easy paved trail. Go early or fight the crowds. Parking is a nightmare.

If you just want to see the fern canyon walls, you\'ll have to cross a creek and they\'re right at the start of the trail about 5ish minutes from parking. Theres a well-sized tree you\'ll have to either climb over or crouch walk under. Without good waterproof shoes, and proper hiking gear, I wouldn\'t consider the first fifteen to thirty minutes as an ""easy"" hiking trail. It was, however, well worth everything. Very gorgeous.', ""The fern walls are really cool. It's def worth the drive down."", ""Super dope when it's sunny"", 'One of the most beautiful hike you can stroll through in Red Canyon. Its a bit challenging because you would have to cross over trees, river banks, rocks, muds, etc. You get the point. The view of the Fern Canyons are spectacular! They are like gardens hanging of the wall.', 'Really enjoyed the beautiful scenery... felt like we were in Jurassic Park & Star Wars!', 'It was an amazing hike, just beautiful. I would hike it again.', 'short, gorgeous. we did the loop but getting over the giant log is difficult. have a really tall guy with you!', 'This was really beautiful and I definitely recommend!Be sure to bring cash for the $8 self register. The road to Fern Canyon is bumping, unpaved, narrow at certain points and dusty. My Nissan Versa did just fine. After passing the Gold Bluffs campgrounds there is a stream that you can cross and the trail head is a mile up the road. There are bathrooms in the parking lot.', 'Favorite according to the kids.', 'Amazing! So lush and green. I loved the walls of ferns.', 'Stunning -- a must-see!!!', 'This trail is so beautiful.  Well the loop trail is closed but just follow the creek through the fern canyon.  If you are adventurous keep going up the creek and climb over all the obstacles.  You will come to a small waterfall on your left that is quite pretty.   We are a family of six.  My kids were in heaven.  Important tip- We all wore muck boots and it made the trail much easier.  Could have sold them to almost anyone on the trail too. ;). If you end up doing the trail in tennis shoes- just plan on getting them wet.  There are board bridges but you are still going to get wet.   The moss, ferns, creek and even fallen trees make this an I forgettable hike.  My kids (who hike often) said it was THE BEST HIKE EVER!   We loved it.', ""This was a great hike! The tall walls of ferns were so unique and the stony river bed was lovely. The hike was very easy. We saw elk and banana slugs, two things we hoped to see while in the area. Be warned, there is an 8 mile drive on an un-paved road to arrive at the parking lot as well as areas where the water streams across the path. We made it through in a mustang so it's doable but nerve racking. Worth it."", ""Did partial hike here 7/1/17. Very easy hike with views that seem to good to be true for the minimal effort involved!! The whole place has a magical, land before time feel. There's lots of water along the path so be prepared to get your feet a little wet. The drive to get here includes 4 miles of rough gravel - so make sure your car can handle it and you don't mind it getting a little beat up. Cool bonus - there's a lovely beach adjacent to parking lot with many wild elk just milling around."", 'Wonderful hike through the cannion covered in ferns. The loop is still closed but the hike is still worth it for the fun alone.', 'Most unique trail that we completed during out visit to the Redwoods parks.  the scenery was amazing and our kids kept themselves busy looking for salamanders. They unfortunately didn\'t spot any. The guide we read said  this trail was ""easy"", which is true if you are not trying to keep your shoes dry. After completely submerging out shoes in the water a couple of times we stopped caring about dry socks and the trail was EASY! My recommendation is ""wear a water/hiking shoe! The loop was closed when we hiked here also, but the hike was still very enjoyable! A must see!', 'This really is as good as it gets!', ""First off we loved it! But I don't know I agree with this being easy anymore. There were so many trees down it was a jungle gym activity more than a hike but that really was half the fun.  There were so many people when we went 7/3 that it was almost impossible to get a good canyon photo."", 'Easy fun trail.', ""Great place to hike with the kids. Didn't make super far but was well worth the stop. There were boards placed down over the water crossing parts since the water flow wasn't high."", 'so beautiful!!!', 'Was cool to see, but no signs or showing how it ""loops"". Ended up being gone for 3 hours! The more fern wall section is easy and good for kids, but once you start climbing over fallen trees and up side trails through overgrown stuff turn back because it\'s like that till who knows how long. did find a Lil waterfall back there though.  With hoe many tourists are there you would think the trail would have signs.....', 'Great trail!  Be prepared to get muddy and wet!', 'This place is really cool.  Highly recommend if making a trip to the Redwoods.', ""Perfect little hike but I would advise wearing water friendly shoes. We ran into the tree obstacle but didn't have any problems getting around/through it."", 'Beautiful hike up a creek surrounded on both sides by near vertical walls of fern, Redwood sorrel, wild ginger, and more.', 'Loved this place.  You will get wet.', 'Bring a dry pair of shoes!', 'Was closed due to flood 12/18', 'Best hike ever! It was kind of scary driving in to the parking lot. The road was so narrow.', ""Awesome and extremely unique little trail.  The only problem is it's too short and too remote.  Hope to take a few friends back in the future."", ""This was probably one of my favorite hikes. went here with my girlfriend for our anniversary and had a blast. the Photos don't do this place justice, a must!"", 'Amazing!!', 'Jurassic park trail. Gf went crazy and climbed some trees', 'Great early morning hike.', ""Most amazing hike ever!, I love this place!! It's like stepping into another world."", 'Very pretty - a little crowded and can be very slippery climbing over some of the fallen trees.  Worth the hike from the visitor center or driving in and walking through the canyon.', 'One of the prettiest and most amazing trails that I have ever hiked. Well worth the 8 mile drive on a dirt road each way.', 'Beautiful and easy hike to do with kids. mostly flat unless you take the stairs to the rim.', ""This is one of my favorite hikes. It's just a nice easy walk through one of the most beautiful places on earth. Plan on your feet getting wet."", ""Just beautiful. I couldn't stop taking pictures. This is a very easy walk through the canyon. If you are visiting the Redwoods National Forest, take the time to see this."", ""Have hiked this trail about a dozen times.  It's a must stop every time we are in NorCal."", ""Absolutely stunning. This was my favorite part of our entire trip. Fern Canyon is a must see!\n\nAlso - we had some people in our group who didn't want to do the entire hike. You can follow a dirt road in past the beach, park and walk about .5 miles to the canyon, as well. If you inquire at any information center in the area (Klamath, Crescent City, etc) they are extremely helpful."", ""Keep an eye out for Elk on the way in! This is a great family hike and would be great for a hot day! We hiking this in early April, it wasn't hot but it wasn't cold either. Once we got to the mouth of the canyon there was a sign posted on the other side of the creek that the loop trail was blocked and impassable. So we opted to just go up the creek into the canyon. At first we tried our best to stay out of the water but had to give up and just walk through the water. It wasn't super cold water so that was nice and our daughter absolutely loved it! We went in as far as we could until a big log jam."", 'Beautifully built and maintained trail with steps, bridges and wayside markings. Walk along the Little River with plenty of ferns, old and new growth trees, wildflowers and small waterfalls. We loved this trail.', 'Beautiful area. Chose to came at one of the backcountry sites.', 'An amazing hike. Easy and breath taking. Bring water proof shoes like rain boots or prepared to get your feet wet. Half of the trail goes through the stream.', 'This was a very cool place. Our three boys, 10 years old, LOVED IT. We stayed for a couple of hours. Will go back again.', 'Easy hike out and back through a lush valley with fern-lined walls. Lots of cool photog spots along the trail. We were there at the end summer and it was still quite cool along the creek.', 'Amazing trail!!! The sheer beauty of this trail is overwhelming. I drove all the way up the coast from LA to see this small loop. SO worth the drive. And as an added bonus, parts of Lost World (of the Jurassic Park series) was recorded in this area. It feels like Dinosaurs are going to pop out around every corner. So sick.', 'very beautiful, a must do before you die', ""One of Humboldt county's best hikes.  Scenic, easy, short.  Fun in the summer when they lay out the little bridges over the creek.  A little bit of climbing over trees, plan to have wet shoes or just don't wear flip flops.  The drive is a bit dicey with pot holes and dirt and a few points you have to drive over a creek.  $8/car for parking for the day.  They've filmed quite a few movie scenes from this area too ;)  Jurassic Park anyone?? You'll sometimes get some great views of the elk.  We've done this trail multiple times and the elk are always my favorite."", 'Took my friends from Bay area there and they loved it. If you go on spring or summer you have to go to car wash afterwards.', 'Beautiful, like I stepped back in time!', ""Pretty much a long jeep trail to get to the canyon from 101.  The trail goes up the bottom of a canyon, so you're basically hopping along/over/in a stream-bed.  I thought it was a disappointment.  May be because of time of year.  I went in mid-March."", ""Keep in mind, to get here is a trek alone. Between pot-hole dusty roads, to creek crossings that can be impassable at times, the drive makes it even more special. Don't let the drive detour you though! Fern Canyon is a MUST. Its incredible. I've been there over 25 times, and whenever i have a guest in town, that's one of the key places i make sure to take them! Heavy Rain, Fog, Sunshine, you name it, do not leave your waterproof hiking boots behind. You willlll need them. Dogs are not allowed on this trail. Parts of Jurassic Park were filmed here, and its no wonder why. Be mindful that this is a key destination spot, so there will also be a lot of people enjoying the scene as well. I went during Labor Day Weekend one time, lets just say that Six Flags doesn't have anything on Fern Canyon."", 'March 23rd 2015 was a dry day, heavy rain made the little creek to deep to chance crossing it in our Kia Optima. We were bummed not to make it, before going in a car you should find out about this creek first.', 'Incredible beauty!! This is a DO NOT MISS trail. Very easy walk.', 'Awesome trail!! One of my absolute favorites. The trail is fun. You get to cross small foot bridges, and climb over trees and logs. And, not to mention to incredible fern covered canyon walls that line the trail. This hike is a must do when visiting the redwoods.', 'Very pretty area. I would have given more stars but for the crowds. This is a very popular area. $8 to drive up to the trail head.', ""My family went on this hike in mid June. They absolutely loved it. My son believed it was where they filmed jurrasic park and it was very believable,  beautiful surroundings. It's definitely a must do when in the area!"", ""From the Elk Prairie Visitor Center & Park Headquarters I took the James Irvine Trail to the Fern Canyon Trail.  I then looped around via Davison Road along the coastal trail south to the Miners Ridge Trail back to the James Irvine Trail and on to my starting point at the Visitors Center.  My iPod Nano showed a distance of 15.9 miles.  This route offers a well preserved and maintained hiking trail, easy to moderate in physical exertion and welled marked. Do take a map, though, but no need for a compass or GPS. There is beautiful foliage seen through the loop, along with many giant redwoods, dense leafy coverage similar to being in a Rain Forest.  The walk along the coastal dirt road is as expected of a seaside landscape before once again entering the forest at the Miner's Ridge Trail.  Miner Ridge Camp was closed October 11, 2013 when I did the hike.  Park signage warned hikers of antelope during rutting season along this section of the trail, but this did not happen during the mid afternoon when I trekked through the section. I did encounter fellow hikers mainly coming in from the Fern Canyon picnic area to see the Fern Canyon; but once passed this section I had the whole loop to myself with the exception of one mountain biker whom I met twice looping the trail, too.  In summary, this is a very enjoyable hike through a dense Rain Forest environment with large redwood trees, ferns, thick foliage, on a well maintained marked trail. Most all stream crossings have bridges that are well constructed and maintain. You also are in the mountainous area for most of the loop so you will be viewing some stream crossings from very high above the water below. If you are looking for a nice 1/2 to 3/4 day hike offering an opportunity for good exercise, then this also is the hike for you to do. It is not a difficult hike at all.Jerry D"", ""This was an awesome adventure I have 5 kids from 4-18 years old and they all loved it. My 4 year old kept saying, this is the best day ever. They all wanted to hike it twice so hike it twice we did. Best 1 mile hike ever. Don't let trees get in your way keep trudging through and you will hike on top and in the river bed."", ""So if you are up for an adventure, just getting to the trailhead will give you one.  Come when you can spend time exploring the beach too.  We thought we'd hit this on our way down the coast.  The road in is long and basically single-track so watch out for on-coming traffic, you'll need to pay a day use fee, and then drive along the rocky beach road to the trailhead (note you can't see the beach from the road, you have to get out and hike to the beach)... Fern Canyon is where they filmed Jurassic Park II and if you really look close you can see the dino's footsteps through the creek that runs right through the bottom of the canyon.  I remember the scene - also watch out for those hungry little dinos that run in packs looking for wayward hikers.  Anyway, we picked our way across the wooden plank bridges - there must have been about 20 ... to cross the river as you get deeper and deeper into the canyon, ducked under and climbed over numerous trees stumps and fallen limbs... The canyon is lined from floor to the top of the walls with lush green ferns - you get a really cool feeling just walking through and looking up both sides.  There were several groups of people who got to a certain point and turned back due to fallen trees, stumps, high water, etc. but if you hike all the way to the back of the canyon, like we did, you'll see some steps to the left which take you to the rest of the loop, which gives you sort of a two phase hike, one through a water-filled canyon and one on higher ground, with a boardwalk at one point.  It is really an adventure and you'll probably run into some of the native elk on the way out.  Recommend this just for the experience!"", ""The drive to get to the trail was a bit bumpy, and there were a few times that we thought we wouldn't be able to make it in our Accord, but we kept going only to find cars much less equipped parked in the lot.  The drive there was long, slow, and completely worth it!\nWe saw quite a few elk on our way there, and then once we made it on the trail, it was just amazing.  It was gorgeous, and my only complaint is that I wish it was longer!  Definitely worth it if you're in the area!"", ""Did this one in late November during a 4-day rainstorm, we were up to our knees in water and climbing over logjams to get through, but it's probably the most beautiful trail I've done so far, especailly when there's no one else there. It connects to Friendship Ridge and the coastal trail running north so you can make a longer loop out of it. Know that the coastal trail turns into a lake in the rain though, so does the dirt road going to the mouth of this canyon, so you will have to park a ways back and hop over some streams. The park road also floods just off the highway but it's usually passible if you drive slow. The canyon is something anyone who's heading up north should see."", 'This hike is beautiful.  It is well worth the drive to stand between the walls of ferns and take in the sights and sounds.  Weekend days can get relatively crowded, so go early, pack a picnic lunch, and enjoy it on the adjacent beach after your hike.', 'Great little hike. We took the easy way in - about a 1 mile loop, but definitely a scenic hike. We went in mid June and the ferns were in full growth. A little wet on the walk in - you can either wear waterproof shoes and hike through the water (about 4-6 inches deep) or balance on logs that were placed to walk across.

If you start from the dirt road entrance which is off of Taqhuitz rd I believe that is uphill. You finish the trail at the parking lot and if you follow the road a little up and to the right you find restrooms and picnic benches. When you go back down there is only a small part that is up hill but then the rest is downhill. We both hiked with our babies in baby carriers. Trust me when I say start from the first road. The hike itself of course is beautiful because you are going through a beautiful forest and beautiful sights as you go higher and higher. However The end isn’t as rewarding as Taqhuitz peak. When Taqhuitz peak opens again from Southridge, I would suggest trying that one. It is a moderate to hard hike due to the switchbacks but it is very beautiful and so worth it when you get to the ranger tower.', 'I definitely suggest starting from the bottom. When I did the trail I only knew of starting at the trailhead . My friends and I hiked through and realized there was parking on the street to start from the opposite side. Hiking back  was mostly uphill and we would have preferred to do it the other way around. To hike uphill first (out) and comeback (back) downhill , park on the street end of the trail not the trailhead end of the trail.', 'Nice views. Dogs liked it too', 'Great hike to take my wife and dogs on.', ""Great day hike to beat the heat and get active. Lots of shade on the trail so it's ok to go in the middle of the day. Good for all fitness levels. Disappointing thing is there is a parking lot at the top of the trail which takes you out of the wilderness"", 'Easy trail, great day hike!', ""Nice shaded hike. I've done bottom to top, and top to bottom, def recommend doing bottom to top."", 'this was an easy trail going out from the trailhead, coming back was more of a climb. although if you start from taquitz rd (if I remeber the street name correctly) you will be going up and than an easy down. it was a little more narrow trail in many spots, and it was warmer this day. we started at 7 am and the bugs were pretty heavy, although this was one of the hottest days of our Summer. we ended and were back home in Hemet by 11 and before we left we went to eat breakfast so it was a quick hike. have fun hiking.', 'Gorgeous hike', ""Easy hike, lots of bugs don't forget your Off Spray.

Started the trail at 07:30 and it was perfect. 59 degrees and practically had the trail to myself for the whole first leg which took me about an hour.  On the way back definitely saw more folks but still not bad.  81 degrees, so getting warmer.  Finished the whole trail in 2 hours.  Saw lupine, giant paintbrush, western azaela's which smelled amazing.  The only negative was it was quite buggy.  Enough to become annoying as the morning heated up.  But all in all I really enjoyed it and it was nice to be able to bring my canine companion.  I'm a bit frustrated in general with the limited trails you can take your dog in this state."", ""Did this hike since we didn't get a permit for Devils Bridge.

Beautiful fall scenery.', 'Nice easy hike. Views often hidden by trees.', 'Easy trail, some good scenery but trees will get in the way of the best views and camera shots. It\'s a rather busy trail with lots of hikers, their dogs, car noise from the road next to it and construction noises from nearby homes. Not the most ideal trail considering what the area offers, but it\'s easy enough for everyone and family friendly. An Adventure Pass is required for this trail, but a Wilderness permit isn\'t according to a posting on the Ranger Station board.\n\nAllTrails has you starting the trail in the south and walking north which is a slight uphill trail most of the way, parking starting from here is on the side of the road. If you follow Fern Valley Road from Idyllwild it will lead to Humber Park where the north trailhead is located right next to the first set of parking spots. This allows you to ""warm up"" walking downhill before the trek back.', ""This is a beautiful, rolling trail that winds across the mountainside through a variegated forest of Ponderosa pine, fir, Western red cedar (or hemlock - I'm bad at telling them apart), and both evergreen and deciduous oaks along with manzanita shrubs wherever the sun pokes through. There is parking at the end the app sends you to as a trailhead, but it's alongside a dirt road and is quite limited. If you use the parking lot at the park, be sure you remember your Adventure Pass as it's National Forest and I did see a ranger there. If, like me, you forget your pass, there are places just outside the park where you can squeeze your vehicle onto the side of the road to park before you hit the steep edge. The trail does have some elevation change, though in the low hundreds of feet. The lower end is at the dirt road, so if you use the parking lot be prepared for a gentle climb on the way back. Footing is decomposed granite, though this is indeed mountain hiking so there are occasionally clusters of small boulders to navigate around. If you have weak ankles or just want to be on the safe side, hiking boots might be advisable. Most of the trail is smooth, though. For the same reason, although the trail allows horses this is really a spot for trail horses and not a weekend trail ride for a show horse. Finally, remember to bring plenty of water - there is no running water at either parking area although the park has pit toilets - and don't forget that even in the shade, at over 4,000 feet in Southern California the sun is very strong. Sunscreen is still a good idea for those who are sensitive to the sun."", 'Great trail with pretty much shade everywhere,which is great for dogs !', ""My family of 7 loved this hike!  Perfect for my children.  We have 5 children under 10.  The baby was on my back and I felt sturdy on the trail carrying her.

Drove up to the trailhead to walk around a little bit, then decided to explore the Ernie Maxwell Scenic Trail. I ended up making it a 4 mile hike. This was a nice little trail. It's 2.6 miles one way. The trail is pretty much half shaded and half sun. At around 1145 in the morning it was close to 90 degrees. The sun was hot and so was the breeze while in the sun. However, in the shade it felt about 15 degrees cooler and the breeze felt great. Starting this hike from Humber Park means you pretty much go down for the first part of the hike and up for the return leg.

Parked at Hubber park parking lot, hiked down to bottom of trail, then hiked back up. We went in group of 4 persons; 2 adults, an 8 yr. old and a 7 yr. old. The hike up was a challenge, because 60% felt like a  steady incline.  Im sure this is an easy trail for many persons that are not so out of shape. I'd suggest parking at the trail head at the bottom of the hill and hike up, so return hike is mostly downhill. "", 'Easy day hike through heavily wooded forest. Manzanitas were in bloom and the views were spectacular. Inspiring views of Marion Ridge, Suicide Rock, and Lily Rock.  On a clear day you can see almost to the Pacific.

Though, sometimes it felt a little too close to the town as we could hear home renovation and saws throughout the entire trail. It offered great views of the valley.', ""Nice enough trail, but it basically tracks the roads in Idyllwild, and you're walking behind houses (hidden a decent amount, and far away, but still), always aware you're in town.  Compared to other hikes in the area, it is mostly flat, so if you don't want much up and down, this is a nice easy hike.  But it would not be at the forefront of my list for any active hikers, especially given all of the other hikes in the area.  We hiked this as the first part of the Devil's Slide/South Ridge Loop, and for that, I highly recommend."", 'Good hike with friends and family.  The trail was very busy.  Certainly not conducive for quiet and relaxing.  None the less, the views were great, the weather was great and the time outdoors is always a blessing.  Although the trail is rated as easy, if you are out of shape (me) it is easy going down but a challenge going back up.  Stay hydrated and nourished and you will be good.', 'Easy fast hike for with the kids.', 'Great easy hike. Beautiful views!!', ""Super easy hike on single track.  It is 2.6 miles in and out.  If you hike before 11am you will be shaded most of the way.  Dogs are welcomed and all of the dogs we met were super well behaved.  Our dog loved the hike.  \n\nIf you start from Huber Park it is down hill in and then uphill out.  The climb is so gradual that it isn't a big deal.  If you prefer to start at the bottom and hike up first than google the trail name and you will find directions to park at the bottom. If you park at Huber Park you MUST get your parking permit at the Ranger Station (and some businesses) a few miles down in town.  You cannot pay at the parking lot.  And if you decide you want to take the other trails (totally recommended) you must get a wilderness permit at the Ranger Station.  So don't just show-up at the parking lot, come prepared."", 'Hiked this trail on July 31, 2015 - perfect weather (especially after getting out of the Palm Springs heat!) and perfect warm up hike for me, my wife and two dogs.  Great combination of shady forested sections for cooling down and open sections for awesome views. Hiked down about 2 miles from Humbar Park, had a great picnic lunch on top of one of the numerous huge boulders, and then hiked back up.  Saw 1 snake, 1 skunk, numerous squirrels and untold number of lizards.  BTW, Final Score:  Lizards - 871, Dog - 0!!\nA definite recommend!', 'Nice easy walk. Lots of people and dogs. We had a good time.', ""I hiked this trail with a friend, twice in late July. We finished the first time right when it started to get dark, and then again during sunrise. It was obviously very hot cause of the time of year, but there was plenty of shade due to the tall trees. You have to get a $5 pass per day, but both times we went to buy it the place wasn't open, we went anyway.The views are amazing once you get some elevation, and the trail itself was very clean, no trash. We only ran into a few groups, probably because of the time of day we went, I imagine it's a popular trail. Even in July/August it was still suprisingly green around the water sources. The elevation is pretty moderate, but can be a little challenging in the heat if your pack is large. All in all I can't think of anything that would of made it better, so it deserves the 5 stars."", 'Easy hike. Not crowded, and made for a nice afternoon with my dogs.', 'One of my favorites!   Beautiful scenery.

There was only a mild elevation gain and it was beautiful for a fall hike. There were many types of trees and also some nice views of the mountain terrain.

We went on Sunday Sept. 15th 2013 around 11am. There were a total of 12 of us from ages 4-49, and everyone did well including the 4 year old named Adam (aka the dude). We started off at Humber Park and hiked down seeing a small rattlesnake and plenty of lizards. The trail was CLEAN and clear and was well marked. Hiking back up (the other 2.5 miles) was challenging at times for the smaller kids and some of the adults, due to the higher elevation but nothing that a few breaks along the way didn't fix. Overall is was a NICE hike and I would recommended it to anyone.  John. (PS Hiking Club)."", 'We used this trail as an intro for our 5 year old son.

"", 'Like others have mentioned, its an easy hike.  Very scenic and straightforward. We saw more people here than we did in Deer Springs.  It seems more popular with tourists. We opted for this one on the day we were leaving and it was a great closing hike. It starts on one trail-head and ends on another so you can opt for either if you prefer going uphill/ downhill first. We did check-in with the the ranger office first before starting. ', 'Headed out on a Saturday mid-morning with our four and six year-old daughters.  Parking lot was crowded, but we did manage to find a spot.  Lots of people and dogs on the trail, but it added to the adventure.  Trail is well maintained and with beautiful views.  Our six-year old is quite the trooper when hiking, and it was easy for her.  The four-year old became tired frequently, so we took many mini breaks along the way.

You can’t see the trails because of the snow so make sure your phone is charged so you can keep checking the AllTrail map!', 'Made it to about a half mile from summit. too much snow and sun goin down. Ice to saddle then powder the rest of the way made it slow but well worth it. Amazing views  past saddle along ridgeline. not too strenuous. Most elevation to saddle. Will do again definitely.

Got there at 7am on a sat. and about 6 permits were left.', 'Such a beautiful hike all the way to lookout tower. enjoyed the hike up but decent was very hard on my knees even using my poles. Will do it again', 'The hike to the saddle completes most of the elevation gain.  From there to Peak is flat or gradual gain.   Really pretty hike.  Lots and lots and lots of dogs on trail.

It's not that difficult but great for intermediate hikers.    Scenery is beautiful.  You can do the loop to Red Tahquitz through Saddle Junction to make it a longer hike.   Just love the scenery.   The ranger station was closed for repair so couldn't walk up the stairs.   When I got to parking lot at 7am there was only two cars there.   When I got back down, and after passing about 50 people going up, the parking lot was full.   Weekends, as with every LA area hike, get there early.   You also need the American the Beautiful or Day Pass for parking and a permit to hike this trail which can be obtained in the town of Idyllwild about 2.6 miles before the trailhead.

This is my first time doing this hike and I loved it! The entire trail is so beautiful and picturesque, I was never bored!"", 'Beautiful hike. I usually approach Tahquitz Peak from South Ridge Trail which IMHO is more challenging, especially the switchback push at the end. There was ice patches along the shady parts of trail — way before the saddle, and snow at the top. Micro spikes and pokes came in handy! A little windy here and there, otherwise was a gorgeous day.

Long but easy trail; last 10 minutes to tower pretty steep but well worth it.  Views are amazing and would definitely do it again.', 'Beautiful hike.  Currently has snow at the top, in case you were unaware of that like I was.  Weather was great in shorts and a t-shirt for the lower half, upper half was a little cold for that.

I have hiked to the same destination a few times before via south Ridge Trail. Today's route is definitely more trafficked--allows dogs whereas the other does not; also a lot shadier. Both are excellent. If you want a cooler route, take Devil's Slide; if you crave more sun, head up South Ridge. Happy hiking!"", 'Hiked this today and I was the first and only one up before 10am.

Outstandingly well-maintained and breathtaking trail. Apple’s Health app said 9 miles. Took me 5 hours, 3 going up and 2 going down. Took 3-4 5 minute breaks and many 1-2 minute breaks going up.

Saddle Junction is beautiful by the way, and at the top you can talk to some cool volunteer fire look-out guys!', 'Great little hike. Make sure you have a parking pass for Humber park. That is where you will park and the trail head is. Amazing views of giant granite formations. Amazing tree coverage. Great getaway for tourists and San Diegans.', 'A very beautiful hike! The first 2.5 miles of Devil’s Slide Trail are a workout. Once you make it up to the junction, the rest of the trail is gentle and fun. You can climb the fire tower for stunning views and maybe even see all the way to Catalina. This is one of the best hikes in Idyllwild, so arrive early on summer weekends to find parking.', 'Super steep but super cool!

Make sure you get your squirrel card if the lookout is open.', 'Great trail! Make sure to bring plenty of water. The fire watch station at the top is definitely worth the trip.', 'Nice steady climb. Saddle junction is large and a great place for a rest/snack. The fire lookout is awesome. Great views all around.', 'Me and my 6 year old son did this hike on August 9, 2017. Most of the trail was shaded it was a great hike. There was a small ranger station at the peak. A ranger invited us to come into the station and he gave my son a ranger certified card. My son was so excited!', 'went late july mid day.  was a nice hike.  Not an uncomfortable hike, but was ready to be down the hill the last mile or so.  Saw a rattlesnake cross the trail on our way back down shortly after summit.', 'Beautiful views all the way around! Definitely worth the climb to the top!', 'Incredible view at the top! Definitely worth the climb. Bring lots of water and sunscreen. Dogs are allowed on this trail but must be on a leash.', 'Awesome views. Worth the trip to the peak to see the fire lookout.', ""So beautiful. Started at South Ridge then made my way from Tahquitz Peak to Humber Park via this trail. The Pacific Crest Trail portion of this hike is on the east ridge of the mountain ridge, offering much welcomed shade from the dense pine trees. Once you connect to Devil's Slide, be ready for hot afternoon sun, especially as you descend to the lower portion of the trail. No cell service in Humber Park so if you need a ride be sire to arrange in advance."", 'Really cool. Was my first time, but definitely looking forward to doing it again.', 'Excellent trail with stellar views.  Great meditation spot at the lookout tower.  Awesome Memorial Day hike.', 'Lovely trail! Challenging uphill but the views at the top are spectacular!', ""Great trail - it's amazing how much the terrain and environment changes with the elevation gain. Started with sun, went through rain, sleet, snow and back to sun again. Be sure to stop and get a permit at the ranger station - they are out there checking. Very friendly but they always ask for your permit."", ""Hiked this trail on May 2 2017.  No snow on the way up to Saddle Junction.  About 0.5 miles past Saddle Junction snow patches began to impede the trail, but it was still passable with some care (and no special equipment).  Another 0.75 miles and snow blocked the path forward (~8550').  Was just a few yards from the ridge overlooking the gorge across from the peak, though.  Great spot for a rest, a snack, and then return to Saddle Junction."", 'My favorite hike, lots of switchbacks and the last mile up is a challenge but worth it. Amazing view at the top.', 'We loved this hike. We hiked in mid April and had to hike trough some pretty thick ice and snow to reach the top. We got there and really enjoyed it. But it was definitely challenging. The scenery is stunning and and views along the way are unreal. The weather was perfect and we could see for miles from the top. We saw lots of squirrels, colourful birds and a mystery black animal climbing a tree!', 'Gorgeous hike, but this time of year ( Late November) you need to be aware of the potential snow/ice conditions. The last set of switchbacks up to the peak was too dangerous unless you had micro-spikes on your boots. Continuous melting/refreeze had turned the trail into an ice-rink and we had to turn around. As we came back down it was clear the many of the hikers coming up the slide had no idea that even at the saddle it was really quite cold, snowy and icy.', ""Great day in Nov for a hike. Did this trail having never been to the area. Length was closer to 9m when all was said and done. The scenery is stunning and It's pretty much uphill the whole way. The second part of the climb is easier. Bring minimum 2 liters of water!Note, you must have a car day pass and a permit. Pass is $5 and the permit is free. You can get them from the ranger station in Idyllwild. I went to the parking lot at the head and had to go back. There were rangers on the trail asking for the permit. Well worth the time and energy! Can't wait to do another trail here..."", ""Pretty strenuous hike, once you get to the junction it kinda levels out but it's still a great work out! Amazing views at the top. Once your into the forest you can go to the right off the trail and basically hit amazing views off any point. Worth it but bring a sweater, once your past the junction it's freezing!"", 'Unbelievable. No words needed.', 'This was my first time to hike the area and I was impressed at all the opportunities to explore. This hike was a training run to get up San Jacinto at a later time, and all went really well. There were a few very scenic spots, including one along the PCT that offered a view to the ridge of Tahquitz Peak and Lilly rock, down to the parking area, and the area around San Jacinto. When I got to the fire lookout, I was fortunate to go inside and see how they spot fires. The view was amazing. I had lunch at the summit and found a benchmark as well. It was a great day.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/l33KEkjcwAY', ""Beautiful scenery. It's a steep climb going up. Worth  the effort"", 'Great Hike nice views and fairly simple to follow the trail.', 'This was a great hike.  Great conditioning going up.  Had a great lunch to the top where you can see meadows with ferns awesome.', 'Not too difficult and the lookout was way cool', ""My third time on the Devil's Slide trail. My second time hiking from Saddle Junction along the PCT to Chinquapin Flat. My first time, finishing this hike off by continuing another half mile up the South Ridge Trail to the Tahquitz Peak Lookout. Knowing the temps would be high 90's, I brought 6 liters of water drank over three liters and shared the rest with others who thought one bottle would be enough. Don't underestimate the hike and the weather. Bring as much as you can carry, even if you don't drink it all. We had our first encounter with a baby rattle snake today. Maybe 10 or 12 inches long. Keep your eyes and ears open. Most times rattlers will sense you coming and avoid you. Most snake bites occur when we startle them. So check your area when taking breaks and sitting down. The trail is great! The first 2.6 miles on the Devil's Slide are challenging. The 1.5 miles along the PCT are pretty easy and relaxing. We had lunch at Chinquapin Plat before heading up the last .5 miles on South Ridge Trail, which is just as challenging as the DST but mostly due to the elevation gain. The views and history of the Lookout are so worth the challenge."", 'Great trail. A million people up there.', 'Always a great hike!', ""Incredible views.  Did this last Saturday and we could see all the way to Catalina, Baja California and Mexico, though I wouldnt have known that if the ranger hadnt pointed them out.\nAlso joined the Ancient and Honorable Order of Squirrels.  :)  Ask the ranger about that one.\nIf you're a beginner, you can make it.  For experienced, it was pretty easy.  Nothing too steep at all.  Very gradual.  And before you know it, you turn a corner and see the fire lookout station.\n\nI take a lot of pictures so going up it took about 2.5 hours.  Coming down was 1.5 hours."", 'Favorite so far. Go to the fire lookout and sign the logbook!!', ""Great hike. Not many on the trail. The weather was in the 70's and the views from the lookout where beautiful. Could see from Salton Sea to Catalina island."", ""Fantastic hike.  Started at Humber Park about 8:30 and was at the fire lookout on Tahquitz Peak by about 10:30.  The first 2 miles are switchbacks with a steady uphill grade, but leaving early meant I was in shade the entire way up.  Once up to Saddle Junction, take the trail to the right and you've got another couple of miles to the Peak.  Most of this stretch is easy hiking with gentle up and downs.  The last 1/2 mile or so is steep up the side of the granite peak.  The view at the top was incredible, especially on a day with Santa Ana winds - seems like you could see forever.  There were a couple of volunteers in the look out, and they were more than happy to let me up there to take a look around and sign the visitor's log.  The trip back down was a breeze, all down hill.  \nOverall, a great hike with plenty of tree cover so lots of shade.  Also, hike on a weekday if you can swing it - I went on a Friday and saw nobody on the way up and only a few people on the way back down.  The volunteer in the fire look out said that I was the first visitor that day, and the day before only 2 hikers had stopped by.  \nI'll definitely be hiking this trail again."", ""Incredible hike, so pleasant and then all of a sudden, you're at the top! The lookout tower is awesome, very fun way to check out the scenery. I'd recommend starting early!"", ""This trail is rated as easy, but let me tell you, it is 4 miles of harsh uphill switchbacks.  It took us six hours (I had to keep stopping) but it was the best hike I've ever completed:)."", 'My husband and I loved this hike. We were fortunate enough for the lookout to be open when we arrived so we got the grand tour.  Beautiful view!', 'Great! Cleared the head. Left parking lot at 7am, back at 1pm after a luxurious return-leg lunch at saddle junction. Did the loop to make it about 9 mi?', ""Fantastic views! I would also recommend taking the Tahquitz Meadow Loop back around to Saddle Junction, there's a lovely meadow and waist high-ferns along the trail."", 'Outstanding Trail, approximately 9 miles long, mostly . Plenty of elevation gain. Not for small children.Requires lots of  water in the summer. You  need atleast 2.5 liters.', ""I have to say I was blown away by the view that this trail gives! All up and then down, we took more breaks on the way down actually. This almost nonexistent winter left most of the trail clear of snow and ice. However the last 0.5 miles had thick ice on it and with one side being a drop off many folks didn't want to go over it. I proceeded to the observatory but my friend stayed behind due to the ice. It's probably only a ten minute climb from where it starts to get bad. Make sure you grab a permit before you go! We didn't get stopped but the ranger station is in town and it's free. Beautiful trail!"", 'If you hike in the winter, wear moisture wicking fabric and dress in layers, as temperatures can change a lot throughout the day and elevations. To add some miles and make this hike a loop… I hiked from Humber Park up Devils Slide to the peak, then hiked down South Ridge. South Ridge will lead to a dirt road you cant miss. Take this to the Ernie Maxwell trail, which takes you back to Humber Park. However, Devils Slide is the best trail in my opinion. There is not much snow right now because of the drought. So go do it. This place reminds me of Yosemite because of the granite rock. Gorgeous place.', ""Winter hike to Tahquitz Peak via Devils Slide Trail is no joke. While the first couple miles were mild and snow-free, once you hit the saddle you might want to put on your spikey's. The last traverse to the summit was pretty scary for this hiking novice, but the payoff is absolutely worth it. It was soooooo windy up there! The view from the fire lookout tower was incredible. Not sure if I'll be trying that one in the winter again, but I'd be very content with a couple summer trips in the future. :)"", 'Wonderful weather today. Had a very late start due to a meetup that was cancelled and had to come up with a quick plan. Started at 1140and was out by 330pm. There was ice and snow on the last 0.3mi of the trail to the lookout tower. People were manning the tower today and I got to sign the register. The skies were  very clear but on the way down the trail seemed even icier. Great fun. Hiked in tank top and shorts through the ice and snow!!', 'This is my first time hiking this trail after the fires. At saddle junction there are caution tapes taping off restricted areas. The weather was cool, crisp and windy.  The fog kept rolling in but avoided me throughout the trip, The views were amazing. However, I did see the portion in the distance that was burned.  It made me wonder what the trail looks like when you head to Wellman Divide from Saddle Junction....restricted now. It was great to be up there again. Taquitz was awesome as usual but just being in these woods helped to relieve my mind that the fires ruined everything.  There is still a lot of beauty left!!', ""We walked this the day after it re-opened after the wildfires came through.  We had previously hiked South Ridge and Deer Springs, so this was interesting because we were seeing a lot of the same things, just from a different vantage point.  While South Ridge has incredible views to the south (and some to the west) the entire hike up, and Deer Springs has great views to the east much of the hike up, Devil's slide is much more varied.  You are basically meandering up the valley between Suicide Rock and Tahquitz, going up a very good gradient without it ever being too steep.  The views are in multiple directions, depending on which way the trail is meandering at any given time.  Then, at around Saddle Junction, the forest becomes much more open, which is a nice change of pace.  Walking southwards on the PCT part of the trail, it opens up even more, with good views to the north (including the burned areas of San Jacinto) and of Mt San Jacinto itself.  Once at Tahquitz, the unobstructed views to the south are amazing.  I definitely liked this better than Deer Springs (which was very nice, don't get me wrong), but am unsure whether I liked it better than South Ridge.  Basically the tradeoff is multiple views and multiple vantage points, plus more varied habitat, on Devil's Slide, versus outstanding views (albeit in only one direction) the whole way up on South Ridge.  You can of course do both by making a loop and combining with the Ernie Maxwell trail - if doing that, I would recommend going up Devil's Slide and down South Ridge."", 'Great trail and amazing views. Water is pretty much dried up mid July but found small streams near Tahquitz valley so be sure to bring up your own water. Very busy on the way down Sunday.  ', ""This trail is one of my alltime favourites. It is a steady climb to Saddle Junction with intermittent views of the valley below.  Rangers check for permits so don't forget to get yours at the station in Idyllwild.  Once at the saddle the trek to Taquitz peak is moderately difficult till the last strenuous climb to the lookout tower. When I went there last time I was the only person there for about 20minutes.  Me and eagles. Awesome!!\nDO IT!!"", 'Just did this hike again. This is still one of my absolute favorite hikes!', 'Did the hike early Saturday morning (9/8/12) and had the trails all to myself majority of the time. It was my first time here and I thought it was amazing! I connected a bunch of trails and hiked a nice loop. Talk about some beautiful views. Parking lot--Saddle Jctn--Skunk Cabbage--Tahquitz Meadow--Tahquitz Peak-- Saddle Jctn back to the parking lot. ', 'Hiked the trail on Wednesday (15 Aug) awesome ran into only two other hikers.  Departed Humber park and went up to PCT and hiked to the over look short of the look out.  It was incredible what a view one of my favorite hikes.  The weather was fantastic fairly cool most of the day.  The views are truly amazing I took my time and enjoyed the view and just took it easy enjoying a rare day off from work.  The trail is well marked with lots of shade.  Went up and came down the same day....was happy to finally see the car at the end!', 'rangers present on a Saturday.  fairly easy hike with excellent views.  i began hiking with intention of hiking red tahquitz peak, but that it is off limits it turns out.  hiked early morning, saw some deer, back at the parking lot at 9:15 am.  humber park parking lot was packed.  hundreds of people loitered the area.  very popular destination.', ""Great hike, fantastic views.  Did this today Feb 25 2012.  Hiked up to the Junction then back down.  Trail had lots of snow and ice but passable if you use some care, I would recommend micros.  The rangers were checking permits most of the day, so be sure to get a pass and make everyone's day easier. "", ' I live down the road from the trailhead so I go here often to take a hike and have some lunch with a great view. I highly recommend it, the views are incredible.', ""Trail was easy to follow.  Started around noon. Saw 2 snakes on devil's slide, one being a rattler.  As I got closer to Tahquitz Peak the view got better and better, but if it wasn't so hazy I would've had a better view of the surrounding cities and lakes."", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '',

The waterfall is about in the center of the canyon reachable by either the east or west.  You have to pay $3 for parking in the east entrance.

Would definitely come back!', 'It was a nice day for our hike, and a beautiful waterfall to top it all off. The dogs loved the water and had a good time swimming around with some of the local kids. The trail went through some shaded parts which was very pretty. The only thing with this trail is that there are a lot of bikers so we frequently had to step off the path to let them by.

The ages of this group ranged from about a year old (carried for much of the trip) to someone well into their 70's. We had a fantastic time! We started at the adjacent park and made a loop from the park, to the waterfall crossing and back. Total distance on this loop is about 6 miles: 3 from the park parking lot to the waterfall crossing, and 3 to get back. Due to the difference in ages/ fitness, some of us walked ahead, and other had a more leisurely stroll or stayed behind, just to admire the scenery. It took us about 4 hours for all of us to complete the loop. Afterwards we had a picnic at the park (I asked everyone to pack a lunch, and leave it at their cars). Everyone had a wonderful time, and have since asked me to organize another outing. I only have one word of warning: we did see rattlesnakes, but they were off trail."", ""Fun ride!

So much here to see geologically and botanically speaking!', 'In 1870\'s, Tiburcio Vásquez, one of California\'s most notorious bandits, used these rocks to elude capture by law enforcement.  Although Vasquez came from an accomplished family, he chose the outlaw path and dreamed of reclaiming California from the ""Yankees"". One of his criminal acts involved the heist of 500 lbs. of silver from a Death Valley mine owner. The stolen silver was never recovered and legend has it, the silver is still hidden somewhere in Vasquez Rocks! His name has since been associated with this geologic wonder. However, in 1873 his life of crime hit its lowest point. Vasquez and his gang robbed a store in Tres Pinos (just east of the Salinas area), which claimed the lives of three innocent bystanders. After evading a posse (and a $1000 reward) he spent the next two years eluding law enforcement as he worked his way south into the Los Angeles area. In May 1874, Vasquez was captured in West Hollywood and in late May, he was moved by steamship to San Francisco where he would eventually stand trial in San Jose. And in January 1975 a jury trial for the three murders did not take long, four days followed by two hours of deliberation. Vásquez calmly met his fate (death by hanging) in San Jose on March 19, 1875. He was 39 years old.\n\nFinally, if you want to see where Dracula, starring Bela Lugosi (1931), Apache, starring Burt Lancaster (1954), Blazing Saddles (1974) Star Trek (TV and film), Power Rangers, The Flintstones (1994), Planet of The Apes (2001) and countless other films and TV shows were filmed (and hunt for missing silver), go to Vasquez Rocks! You can hike and climb where all your favorite characters lived, died, and battled.', ""Very cool hike. Pretty hard to stay on the trail mapped out here, but wandering around and getting off path is part of the fun! Take time to climb around on the rocks and stop by the interpretive center to learn about the geology and natural history of the area, Tiburcio Vasquez and all the movies and TV shows that have been filmed here. It's a fun area to explore and I definitely feel like I could come back here multiple times and not get bored. Brought our small terrier and he had no problem keeping up and hopping around on some of the rocks with us. we didn't take him up the major rock formations, though, so that might not be the safest for dogs."", ""We did this hike the Friday after Thanksgiving and it wasn't very crowded when we got there shortly after 9am.  The trail was a little difficult to follow but we just made our own trail and had a great time.  The trail is rated moderate but could probably be rated as easy, we have been on other trails that were rated easy and we're more difficult.  Overall it was a nice hike and recommend it to all.  Also when we finished around noon the parking lot was full and many people on the trails."", 'diverse trail. fun and a good workout.', ""More incredible than I imagined it would be, for how close it is to LA. I went with my father and we didn't stress too much over trying to stay on the trail, as there are many places where it's easy to deviate and forge your own, scramble over the rocks, and make a good time of it."", 'Great views. Seen Cub Scout pack getting their hike on! Easy trail. National Hiking Day', 'Beautiful area but it was so hard to follow this trail. So many washes and false trails that led me and my partner astray. Ended up adding two miles to make it a 5-mile total hike. Ended up on the PCT at some point? I made it out in one piece so I’m not complaining.', '3 miles as the crow flies. going up and down hills, it feels a lot longer. great views', 'The rocks were great to climb on. The trail was a little hard to follow in certain spots but it was still a good hike. Not that strenuous.', 'This was an awesome trail! It’s super easy to hike, but it’s the rocks that are the star of the show! Get ready for some gorgeous geology and great views!

Not very difficult and not very long trail ', 'Alright but you can find better rock formations in Alabama Hills and Joshua Tree.', ""Easy to get to it from the highway. Many people taking photos in nice dresses, etc. massive picnic table areas for large events. Some rocks are very close to the parking so you don't have to necessarily hike to get awesome selfies."", 'Beautiful area filled with easy hikes for the family.  You could spend most of the day here.  They have a nice visitor center with clean restrooms inside.  There are plenty of picnic tables and port-pottys throughout the park as well.  Stop in the visitor center and grab a couple of trail pamphlets that explain the history of the park.', ""Spectacular scenery, very kid-friendly, with lots of easy trails winding through the rocks.

Wander, climb some rocks, enjoy the views!"", 'Good hike overall; the rocks are awesome and the history is cool to learn about. The trails are pretty easy to follow and parking is almost always available. There are crowded sections, but as you meander along this trail, it thins out.

I came on a Wednesday around 1p and it was practically empty. I would consider myself a hiking novice (I own no hiking shoes and have terrible direction, but have an athletic background that makes my endurance for hikes pretty good); that being said, hiking up those nice rocks are pretty easy and quick. I was only here for about an hour with my two shibas as there was another doggie barking at them on the actual trail. My dogs fared well, I kind of just wandered around what was in the main lot. Maybe next time I'll try to locate some real trails - I saw mention of a cave? My two medium dogs did fine; they've hiked up to 5-6 miles before so this was more like a very long walk for them. The rock formations are beautiful! Really cool and not too far from LA."", 'amazing, beautiful!', ""I hike this trail frequently with my dog. It's our favorite place to hike in our valley. She's more of a mountain goat  than a cattle dog, so she loves going off trail to do a little rock scrambling."", 'Great family hike,lots of trails. The scenery is beautiful, weather was 79 degrees. The kids enjoyed climbing the rocks., easy hiking unless you’re climbing to the top of the rocks. Enjoyed the drive there.', 'Easy hike with lots of paths.

There are multiple parking lots within the hiking area but they open at 8AM.  If you decide to go a little earlier, you can park on the side of the road and just shimmy your way through the gates.  \n\nOnce you get to the rocks, you can choose to climb it peer down and get major vertigo (i did - but it was worth it!).  Aside from the main attraction (the rock), there are other trails you can take and go on your own little adventure - just don't get lost.  \n\nOverall, a pretty nice hike that's not too difficult at all!  I recommend wearing a power rangers or star trek cosplay on cause this is where they actually shot some of the scenes for those shows.  I was expecting to see Zordon but realized he died in the first movie.  :("", 'Awesome Amazing Hike! Beautiful views !

Fun on trail and off!', '', ""My friends and I got there around 10 AM today and there were very few people on the trail. We took the trail from the parking lot on the left side of the entrance, behind the rock where there are a few picnic tables. Spotted the cave way off in the distance. Surprisingly it was not difficult nor did it take a long time to get to it. The photos from the cave came out amazing. Next time we will try to reach it a shorter way, from the metal gate on the right side of the access drive, just before you get to the big parking lot. Find the creek bed and head left. You'll see the cave on the right eventually. Total loop to cave and back around 4.11 miles."", 'Interesting little place.

He recommended taking the PCT til I got to the Hwy14 tunnel. Great views til the tunnel, not very challenging. I went past the tunnel, the only view is of hwy14. I went back and wondered the foothill trail and saw some more great views.Made it into a 7.5 mile hike, just depends on how far down the PCT you go and how many directions you wonder on the foothill trail. Biggest complaint was all the horse poop. Tip- park in the 2nd lot to the left, that’s the easiest spot to start the PCT & you can get right back to it from the foothills.', '', '', 'Family friendly and dog friendly park.  there are several trails to take.  some paths are not well marked so you can easily get lost.  hardly any shade so bring plenty of water, snack, put on sunscreen and hat.  it was windy today, 65-75 degree weather...perfect for this hike.', 'Just like the movies!', 'This is unlike any place on earth.

Plenty of trail options to circle Vasquez Rocks... please do not litter. Picked up a couple plastic bottles...', 'It\'s definitely an excuse for a hike. The Vasquez rocks area has some cool geological formations, cave paintings, great film history, and a labyrinth of trails to explore. Desert landscape isn\'t much to look at and a good portion of the area is ""charmed"" by the sound of the 14 Freeway. Little to no shade on any of the trails and the fact that it gets blazing hot makes sunscreen a must. There is some elevation gain depending on how you take the trails, but nothing strenuous. Running through the middle of the park is a little over 2 miles of the PCT that can be explored. If you enjoy being in the wilderness, proximity to civilization (and the freeway in particular) may make this one less enjoyable. However, it\'s still a good place to get out on a trail for a couple hours.  ... oh, and watch your step. Horse poo everywhere.', 'So much fun!  Love climbing Vazquez rocks.', 'Very nice geological features and some archeological cave paint.', 'Love this one. I usually go to the cave. Last time I went, I went off trail. Two helicopter rescues here when for the hike. Areas were steep at times but nothing too crazy. Was with 6 year old and she I made it through with a smile', ""Vasquez rocks park is a pretty fascinating formation of sedimentary rocks that are sitting at ~45degs. Lots of caves and interesting formations. One negative is that this place gets busy and there are lots of horse trails which means horse crap all over the wider trails. Also the site is a maze of small trails going every possible way ....and thay are not marked, so without a gps or phone app it's easy to just wander around on trails without knowing where you are going or if you are on a trail that will actually get you somewhere. Overall pretty cool but bring lots of water as it gets hot with no shade, and bring your gps or phone for a map of the trail maze."", 'Two heli rescues today- be safe out there!', ""Lots of trails for hiking or horseback riding. PCT section runs through here. Not a lot of shade anywhere but it's high desert. There is water running in the creek this year, yay!"", 'Beautiful scenery and some cool vista points!

Crossed a few small streams and saw many lizards :)', 'Fun', ""The rocks are really fun to climb on but we saw more than a couple people get into some trouble - they are no joke. Come out in hiking boots or shoes with decent grip if you want to climb.

There are connecting trails that lead from the southernmost point of the Vasquez trail to the PCT. Enjoy!"", 'One of my favorite places.', 'Great hike ! Make sure to stay hydrated!', 'Great fun hike with lots of climbing opportunities on the rocks.  You get to hike part of the PCT (Pacific Crest Trail) that runs right next to the rock area.', 'It was so much fun climbing the rocks and the surrounding hills are so green! This is the time of year to come out; perfect temperature and great photos. Wear shoes with good traction for climbing. It made a huge difference for me.', 'There are several paths through the rocks, leading you to different rock formations that you can climb.  You can climb as comfort permits. Several children and younger adults were climbing very high up in the tallest outcropping, but my group only climbed as far as was comfortable to do in regular tennis shoes.', 'Very green right now due to the recent rains. There was a bit of slippery terrain, but overall it is a moderate hiking area.', 'Famous rocks the have been in TV and movies for decades', 'Absolutely loved hiking here!', 'Great views atop the rocks. The trails are not clearly marked in some areas, but it is fun to explore. We happened to go a few day after some heavy rain and it was crisp and clear.', ""I took the PCT through the tunnel, and just a little beyond. There's really not much to see once you go through the tunnel. Best thing about this trail is the rock formations. I recommend doing this hike during the cooler months, as there is no shade except down in the canyons. Stunning scenery. Bring plenty of water, a hat, and sun block anytime of year."", 'Cool', 'nice trail', 'Great views and just a pleasure to hike.', 'My husband and i went here in October and the weather was perfect. The climbing is relatively easy but there are some optional more difficult parts that i let my husband try first to see if i was able to do it. Overall there are alot of easily accessible high up point to climb to that still give you the satisfaction of climbing. Very fun and i definitely enjoyed the geography trail by the parking lot.', 'Great easy hike around the park and lots of fun rock formations to mess around on.

He concern is falling boulders', 'I parked at the Interpretive Center and followed the PCT along the Geology trail. Beyond the far picnic area, the trail follow a ridge road with great views back towards the Famous Rocks. At the end of the ridge road, the trail dives in and out of a canyon following the Horse/Foot trail; this is the most difficult part of the trail. I chose to back track along the ridge road and took an easier trail back towards the Famous Rocks. That trail goes behind the Famous Rocks and eventually connects with the history trail back to the Interpretive Center.  About a 3 mile easy loop.', ""I loved it.

Great day hike to the tunnel and back.', ""This is a very easy to get to and beautiful short trail . It's actually a tiny segment of the Pacific Crest Trail so if you did want to go further than it says it is on here you can . Even though it's not that long of a segment there is lots to see. FYI the start of this trail is at the very beginning of the entrance to the area where the road is. You can also reach it by going left from the visitor center and parking in one of the dirt parking lots. It's also free to park. It is not remote and there will be people and you can even see the 24 HwY in the distance but even so it wasn't too many people and it definitely still feels like you're in impressive natural surroundings. The visitor center is also really nice with a large interesting exhibit area.

Up and down large rock formations and down through washed out canyon areas, great workout, best done early in the morning when its cooler out and less people.

Great place, though it was really hot when we went. We didn't really follow any trails - instead, we bee-lined straight to the biggest rock formation we could find and just climbed it and played around. The rocks there are very cool; different colors and jagged points while some look like weird alien bubbles. \n\nWe parked in the first parking lot, but if you keep going further in, there is a second one that has outhouses and some picnic tables under shade. Not too many people and is dog friendly. \nUnfortunately, it is rather close to housing and the free way. It didn't really bother me, but just a heads up. Also, the trails aren't that clearly marked. All in all, though, great place. Planning to head back once the weather cools down a bit.\n\nHours are 8am-7pm, and there was no parking fee.

This place covers so much geology it is crazy!  Three miles is if you just cover the loop, but we ended up doing nearly five because we explored ridges and canyons.  Give yourself plenty of time on this one and hit every trail in the place.  Word of warning, you are exposed the entire day!  If it is hot you will roast, if there is wind you will get nailed!  Also be on your toes, because it is so easy to get off trail here.  If you study up on the trails there is no problem and the place is not that big so it is not like you will get lost, but if you are careless expect to do a lot of extra walking.  Down side....it is nearly impossible to really escape here.  The 14 freeway borders one side, houses on two other sides, people, cars, etc.....kinda spoils the vibe', 'great for all ages, parking easy to find a spot. dog friendly.....I ended up heading to other trails that surround the main rock formations, that gave our group a good workout.', ""I have done this trip a couple times. What I love about Vasquez so much is that I literally go and try to get lost!! It's a small park with many routes and fun every time. Cool tid bit is that a tunnel goes right under the 14 freeway.

Go to Vasquez, you will not be disappointed.', ""Great Trail for the whole family. The views are amazing. The rock formations are like nothing I've seen before.  I wasn't expecting much being that it is tucked in between a residential neighborhood and the freeway. As other reviews have said make sure you stay on the main trail as there are lots of little trails that break off and just dead end.

While most of the coastal areas were geting rain, it was a great mostly overcast day at the park.  Still, it felt warmer than the 70 degree thermometer reading.  2nd time I actually hiked it and did the big loop and the PCT trail detour.  The last quarter of the trail is kind of hard to follow as it dosen't seem to get too much usage and there are lots of little side trails breaking off here and there.  I would rate the first 2/3 of the hike as very good and the last third as avg.  The best part of the park though is climbing the rock formations of which there are plenty.  Most people just climb the main formation and the jumble that has the cave, but there are also some good clusters near the picnic area and a few that are little more difficult to acsend near the PCT. My partner climbed to the very top of the main formation and was disappointed that i decided not to attempt it this time. I had done it before and was a little tired from the hike (4mi 1.5hr), but that didnt stop her from instagramming everyone that I chickened out.  I'll be back soon and next time I'll be sure to make the climb to the top even though I do not like heights!  6.75 rating fun place as long as your not here in the middle of summer.

I highly recommend this place for a casual, short hike just outside the valley.', 'There are trails around the area but are well published.  A visit to the ranger trailer will get you a map.  The ranger from LA County Parks and Rec that was on site was awesome!  She was very helpful pointing out where the trails were on the map, told us a little about the history of the area, and how many movies and TV shows were filmed there.  It was pretty interesting.

Gorgeous mountain and lake views with abundant water sources (passing through seven lakes in 3.5 miles)! Nice campsites along Heart Lake, Chickenfoot Lake and Gem Lake. Fishing is good in most lakes. Perfect for older dogs. Very crowded and hard to find parking during summer. Permits are hard to come by, but walk-ins are very doable.', 'Pretty lakes & mountains with snow caps', 'Outstanding hike and views! We missed the fall color up here but still well worth the trip!', 'Oh yeah. Trail starts you at 10000 feet and hikes you incredible views of the eastern escarpment of the Sierras. Not bad for a 7.4 mi day hike.', 'One of our favorites', 'We loved this trail! Great for a hot day. There are clear cold lakes to jump in every half mile or so. There were a lot of people but everyone was very friendly and didn’t even make comments about my dog off leash. My pup is very friendly but she is a pit bull so many people make incorrect assumptions about her. We all had a great day. I was wishing I had brought sleeping gear. I wanted to keep going and going!', 'Beautiful trail, the lakes are amazing,our dog enjoyed it too. The trail starts at mosquito flat, just follow the rock creek road to the very end, the road to parking lot gets narrower but the parking lot is huge.', 'Ok hike. To many people', 'Best hike ever, you will not be able to take a bad picture, the whole trail is huge a scenic view, each lake different, each unique.Highly recommended!Not a difficult hike, but moderate rating is correct', 'For those who’ve been on the trail recently, what are the weather conditions at the top of the mountain, ie lowest Temperature, wind speed, rainfall?', 'awesome!', 'This is stunner. I do it every time I visit the area. One of my very favorites.  Word of caution for older hikers with bad knees, hips, etc, however. Allow extra time for return due to multiple ""steps"" as you approach trailhead. I did this hike again yesterday. I had no trouble with altitude since I live in the mountains. Took me three hours to reach Gem Lake including 30 min lunch stop at Long Lake. Took four hours to return from Gem Lake to parking area since I really had to take my time on the descent due to my bad knees. Probably best to allow 8 hours to be on the safe side.  Best to get started early morning due to limited parking also. Bring hiking poles to save those knees! Those with no knee issues will complete this hike much faster though. Enjoy! It\'s a beauty.', 'can be crowded but very few places have so much to see in such a easy hike', 'Great trail, stunning scenery.  Did it the week after Labor day so reasonably quiet.  the only downside is that it starts at 10,000 ft so a day or two at altitude before is a good thing.', 'Great day hike out to Gem lake with my two sons. (17 and 27)  At my normal pace it’s not a difficult hike, but trying to keep up with the two of them make the hike more difficult than it should have been. Lots of opportunity for great pictures and you can gauge your progress by the number of lakes you pass. Only negative, there was a lot of traffic on the trail. We were rarely alone. If possible, I would avoid this trail on busy weekends, otherwise great hike.', 'Went with my friend Don.  Camped at Chickenfoot lake and day hiked to Gem Lakes.   Awesome scenery.   This is a very easy hike for a couple of 58 year olds.   There was some pack animal traffic and a lot of day hikers.   We had one late afternoon thunderstorm, but not too bad.', 'I docked a star from my rating because the trail is so dang busy! I hiked it on June 10, 2018. Arrived around 8:00am and had plenty of parking spaces to choose from. We took our time (more of a stroll than a hike) stopping frequently to take photos. By mid - day there were hikers in view almost constantly. Many had dogs. Consequently there was no sign of any wildlife other than birds and ground squirrels.', 'As stated in the trail description, this trail is entirely above 10,000 ft.  You will pass by many different lakes.   The views are awesome and its almost impossible to take a bad picture.  The only drawback is that this is a very popular trail head and parking can be a challenge so come early.', 'beautiful scenery and so many lakes within relatively easy hike .', 'A beautiful area that is easy to navigate. Bugs are minimal at this time and the smoke from the fires was not in the valley the two nights we were there. Although we did have smoke haze on the 395 getting there. Afternoon thunderstorms gave us a variety of weather but nothing too major. Love coming here!', 'Just got home after backpacking to Gem lake for the night. From the trailhead the elevation gain is just less than 1000, but the altitude will likely slow you down a bit. The flowers are spectacular, God had a wonderful palette of paint; purple, red, yellow, pink, white, orange.  It is like an amazing garden of color. There are nice campsites at Gem lake and the mountain scenes are awesome. We got rain during dinner for about three hours. The thunder and lightening was a treat, far enough away not to be dangerous but breath taking. Had a wonderful morning and lunch filled with sunshine and birds singing. On our hike down it rained and we made a quit exit and drive to Mt Whitney restaurant in Lone Pine for a great burger and onion rings. Before our ride home on my Ninja.

Like most, had to turn back at Chicken Foot the snow was too much for us. I'll be back soon though.  This hike is a must do!"", ""Great hike. When you start there is a fork. Go LEFT for Morgan Pass for this hike. Just before you get to Long Lake, there is a river crossing. It has stepping stones, but on 3rd June, you had to put your feet under water to cross it. Luckily we were wearing waterproof boots thanks to a recommendation from a guy who hiked on Memorial Day Weekend. Then once at Long Lake, there were snow patches on the path that you had to trudge through. We didn't quite make it to Gem Lake, because the snow was up to our knees. Up to the fork for Chicken Foot Lake was ok."", 'a lovely hike with so many beautiful lakes, still snowy up towards Morgan pass, but glad we came. hiked on June 2, 2018.', 'Beautiful hike!', 'Wow, just amazing!!  I just did this hike this morning, 5/27/2018.  Memorial Day weekend. The temperature was 35F at the trailhead at 8:30am, but it honestly didn’t feel bad at all. I imagine in the summer the parking spots would all be taken by this time. But today there were plenty. The hike is not really very hard or strenuous. Just the altitude can be an issue for some. I would definitely wear some boots that are water proof or resistant. I did see quite a few people wearing tennis shoes and I’m sure their feet were soaked. There was a lot of runoff from the snow along the trail so it was a little sloppy. And there’s at least one decent river crossing where you’re feet are bound to get wet. There were lots of patches of snow along the way, and by the time I was at Long Lake the entire trail was basically snow covered. And it’s deep. It was cold enough that the snow was pretty packed, but I did have many post-hole instances. I trudged along in the snow until I reached Chickenfoot Lake and then turned around. The snow was just too much. But overall one of the most beautiful hikes I’ve ever done! Coming back I ran into the crowds of people just coming up. Most of them seem to stop at Long Lake and fish and picnic. Do this hike! You won’t regret it.', 'Gorgeous hike! Stunning vistas. When we started the gate wasn’t open, but it is now. Lucky hikers can park and start right at the trailhead! We had hiking shoes and were fine, but micro spikes would have worked well today, -still large spots with snow, though melting quickly. Snowshoes as you get deeper would surely come in handy. We turned back 3 miles in (we started late) but I imagine our shoes would have taken us all the way. Just be careful as the snow is melting and it’s easier to fall through.', 'Truly a ""gem"" of a hike - the views are spectacular! Starting at 10K, but not a lot of elevation gain in the hike. Did this over the summer, but created my account in January, so we did NOT go in the winter!', 'Great hike! The road to the trailhead is closed due to snow 1.3 miles short of the trailhead. Luckily others had hiked before us so the snow was slightly packed out. When my gps said we were .8 away from gem lake the footprints stopped. The snow was now too deep, in my opinion, to posthole for another mile and it was getting late so we turned around. Still a beautiful hike!', 'We went up to Bishop for a night with our pup two weeks ago and decided to try our hand at this trail—glad we did. Every turn gave you a new breathtaking view of snow tipped mountains and several lakes. We even saw a few people playing ice hockey on a frozen lake! We aren’t experienced hikers, but the intensity of the trail was doable with a few breaks along the way. Due to a flare up of an old back injury, we turned around with a mile left before the turnaround, unfortunately. It took us about 4 hours for 5.5 miles and the views and experience were definitely worth putting in the miles!', 'This is a beautiful trail! It is very well maintained and our 5 year old and 9 year old hiked it fine.Our only issue was initially finding the trail, as many websites hardly mention it. “From Bishop go North on Highway 395 to Tom’s Place. Follow Rock Creek Road to Mosquito Flat to the end of the paved road where there is plenty of hiker parking.”Those were the best direction I found. No distances listed.', 'Very scenic hike, slight incline the ap says it’s “easy” it’s a little harder then easy for beginners but the scenery is absolutely beautiful, the trees, rocks, lakes and mountains are just perfect. Worth your time.', 'Epic trail def want to start early', 'This hike was spectacular. Lots of great views. Because of poor planning, we ended up going over Morgan Pass and kept hiking for 2 extra miles. The sign that was SUPPOSED to be directing people to Morgan Pass vs gem lakes was MIA. This caused quite the confusion within our party. We then made our way over to gem lakes and decided to climb the ridge next to the upper lake. (YOLO) overall, great hike, great views, would rate 10/10.', 'Great vistas. Gorgeous sky, lakes, running streams. Perfect half day hike (we went on up to Morgan pass).', 'We hiked the trail to Gem Lake this weekend. Temps were great during the day, nights were chilly. We camped and were very cozy in 20 degree bags with no problem. Snow was still present at Gem Lake (11,000 feet). Fish were small but fun to catch. The altitude in addition to our overweight packs kicked our buts and the kids succumbed to a few hours of altitude sickness. I would suggest a day of acclimation if your coming from sea level like we did before carrying 35 lbs up 1000 feet of elevation gains like I did. I was beat at the top. We saw two hikers turn around at the .5 mile mark because the first part is a bit steep if not acclimated. Views were spectacular, trail is beautifully well kept. Lake pristine. Lots of hikers in the first three miles....even Gem Lake at 3.5 miles in had a good number of campers. We had rain showers both days during late afternoon. 3-6 pm. 5 stars for the beauty of the trail. Lots of lakes and creeks to cross. Lots of dogs on trail on and off leash. All were friendly. No water at trailhead. Bring water / water filter device.', ""Follow Rock Creek Road from 395; it turns into a narrow gravel road, so just stay on the road to the trail head parking lot. Easy trails to nice lake and mountain vistas, so it's probably a good idea to get there early on a weekend. In minutes you get to view Mack Lake, then Heart Lake and Box Lake. Got to shoot pix of the lakes and plenty of wildflowers, which I didn't expect at the end of August. There were some mosquitoes near the lakes and toward dusk; overall a great quick alpine lake fix.  Looks like there are plenty of campgrounds on the road into the trailhead."", ""There are no signs either reaching the trail head or along the trail. You have to know that Little lakes valley trail head is called Mosquito flat trail head. There is no sign along the trail showing either direction or distance. The last mile from Long Lake to Gem lake is steep and difficult. There is no sign for the direction to Gem lakes (on the right). On busy days like Labor day, if you don't reach there by 8 am, you won't find parking. It took us 5 hours(about 3 hours to Gem lakes and 2 hours to come back) to complete the trail(including stopping for pictures), so plan properly. Gem lake is the 6th lake on the trail. although the maps says 7.2 miles, our app calculated 8.5 miles."", 'Hiked to Lower Morgan 1st then on way back made it to Gem Lakes. Well worth the trip! The turn off to Gem Lakes was moved further up the trail and not as on the recording. Mosquitoes early in the AM but not later in the morning.', ""Got bit in excess of a dozen times.  The mosquitoes bit through my clothes!  But areas sprayed with DEET were left alone.  A mosquito head net is a good idea. Altitude is definitely a factor, but this affects people differently.  If you know you're sensitive, you may want to allow time to acclimate.\n\nThere were A LOT of people on this trail.  It got really busy by 12p.  If you want to get away from crowds, this won't be the hike for you. There's a stream crossing where the trail got washed out.  You can either hop on the rocks, some of which are wobbly, or just wade through the shallow-ish water.  The trail is wet in other spots, too but easily negotiated."", 'This is one of the most beautiful hikes anywhere. The lakes and streams combined with the high granite peaks make a creative statement. Enjoy a day in ""God\'s Cathedral""!My boys and I have been backpacking in this valley for years together. We love exploring the lakes beyond the trail. But beware the mosquitoes are fierce this year!', ""By far the most beautiful hike I've ever done. Elevation is serious so be prepared and acclimated. However there are so many beautiful lakes and views to enjoy no matter how far you go up."", 'Best hike of the week.\nGetting to Gem Lake was difficult to find with the snow still at the turn to the lake.  \nThis was actually a 8.25 mile hike with the additional hiking to the little lakes.  \nAwesome photo taking.', 'So many beautiful lakes, streams, meadows, and wildflowers that you start to become desensitized to them.  This is only a five-star hike if you go all the way to the last (and best) Gem Lake, which requires some off trail excursions across snow and overflowing creeks.  We definitely needed GPS for the last half-mile.  The hike is easy and therefore a bit overcrowded for the first two miles from the parking lot.  Make sure you bring LOTS of bug repellent if you start early.  The mosquitoes were more manageable when we returned at 11am.', 'Gorgeous hike. The river crossing between Box and Long Lakes was difficult especially without poles and after crossing and reaching Long lake the trail is under snow sloping to the lake for a a section.  We turned back, crossed back over and took the trail leading to the right which also goes to a nice area on the shore of Long Lake.', ""An absolutely beautiful trail with stunning mountain, river and lake views at practically every step. While the elevation gain isn't too bad along the trail, you do start at around 10K ft. Be prepared for the mosquitoes that will greet you as soon as you arrive in the parking lot, then tag along as you hike. Extremely popular with both humans and dogs."", 'Great backpacking trip to Long lake. Original goal was Gem but we were not comfortable with the river crossing between Box and Long lakes. Saw a few people attempt and fall in the water (moving very fast right now). Still lots of snow past Box lake. We tried to navigate around Long Lake back to the trail but were not comfortable with the snow bridges (lots of water underneath and soft snow). Road is open now to the trail head, which means lots of day hikers :(. But we pretty much had Long Lake to ourselves as most day hikers turn around at Box. We found a campsite up on a ledge on the SW side of the lake, facing Morgan pass. Lake refroze overnight, but really perfect temperatures for early summer hiking!', ""This is a truly beautiful trail. Day hiked it with some friends last November, slung the hammock up back by Long Lake and threw some lines in, while the wife and dog explored a bit . The brook trout were hitting hard, and I pulled out one after the other, all pan sized. The lake was half frozen already, but it was dead silent and we had the whole thing to ourselves. For a heavily trafficked trail, we were lucky to be able to get that serenity and solitude that we typically have to go deep into the wilderness to get. Perfect day. I'm really excited to come back and do a long weekend backpack trip to gem lakes, but by the looks of the last few reports and pictures, we probably need to give it a month or so."", 'Amazing trail. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Temperature was 25F at 9am and warmed to near 55F at 4pm. Road from Rock Creek to Mosquito Flats Parking Lot was still closed with around 2 feet of ice mounds blocking. Trail was mostly covered with the same amount of melting ice and some deeper pockets beginning at Long Lake. Most of the interior lakes were still frozen over, though the streams were gushing with ice cold drinking water. Easy to wander off of the trail after Box Lake due to snow the night before, but relatively easy to know where you are.', 'Do I need a backpacking permit or can we just go?', ""This can be Day hike or a short easy backpacking trip. it's pretty easy just keep in mind that you start at over 10,000'. you will see several lakes all have fish so bring you fishing rods."", 'Amazing. Totally recharged my internal battery', ""It's a very pretty high altitude trail.  I used this trail to help me get ready for my successful climb of Mount Whitney."", 'Really nice with lots of views.', 'Very pretty and relatively easy hike! Lots of mosquitos this time of year though (June) so bring your spray or cover up!', 'Nice moderate trail with a beautiful lake  to relax, worth the hike.', 'This is a great easy hike with amazing views of lakes and great Sierra mountains', 'Beautiful especially in the snow! Just a wonderful hike!', 'Bummer Bummer and Bummer. With stupendous planning upfront to hike this trail only took us about .7 miles with only to realize snow was daunting. Will go back and yes worth the write-up on disappointment as this is a gorgeous 7 mile hike worth going back to Bishop for.', 'Awesome place to backpack for a night or two and try some luck with the fishing! Awesome views!', 'Loved it!', 'Allows dogs!', 'Beautiful! Great hike and my dog even loved it!', 'Beautiful trail. Many spring flowers. No snow as if this review.', 'Nice trail. Most scenic lake is the one at end if trail: Gem Lake. Not too many people on trail but a lot of dogs.', 'Gotta love confusing place names, there is this Gem Lake along the Mosquito Flats / Little Lakes trail. Then there is also a Gem Lake above Agnew Lake up the Rush Creek trailhead about 30 miles northwest along the June Lake Loop!\n\nThis area according to http://www.monocounty.org/rock-creek/ says the road is under construction through 2015 and 2016 so plan ahead!', ""Cant say enough about how beautiful this trail is. One thing important to note is the hike begins at very high elevation so you may notice you rbreathing is more difficult if not acclimated. I went here in late spring and there was still snow just past Heart Lake. Ice covered part of the lake..and the grassy areas were still gold-brown and a little marshy.\nWe wanted to keep going but didn't have the right gear for snow hiking..started post holing and turned back just past Heart Lake West end..this was mid may (but 2014)\n\nThere are many more lovely spots along Rock Creek road on your way up as well to stop and explore and maybe have a picnic or spend the day. Many fisherman in this area as well. "", 'Great trail with a lot of beautiful lakes!', 'Amazing trail!', 'Easy enough hike, starting at the high elevation really makes it nice. The fishing was fun, lots of small Browns. It was just what we were looking for.', 'Great trail, and the view a the end makes it all worth while, our dogs loved it too.', 'Stunning, long easy hike, continues on and on. Rewards at every turn.', ""This one is highly recommended.  Stunning views, multiple lakes and it's great for a day hike or use it as a start for an overnighter backpack.  The trail is not that difficult and good for kids and dogs."", 'This area is such a great area to camp, backpack, fish, and hike. The little lakes valley trail is a fairly easy trail and all the trails that venture to other destinations along the way are very well marked. This trail also leads, if desired, over Mono pass and down to the Pioneer Basin area.  Of  course, going over Mono pass is much tougher than going through the Little Lakes Valley, but it is so worth the extra effort.', 'In late May, the trail was a little wet but manageable. We passed Mack Lake, Marsh Lake, Heart Lake, Box Lake, and part of the Hidden Lakes.  Most of the trail went uphill going in which is nice coming back out.  The views were breathtaking (in more ways than one)!  We caught a brook trout too.', 'Great hike! Some up and down hills at high elevation make you stop to catch your breath. Amazing views in all directions. ', 'My all time favorite!  ', 'This trail is one of the best in the Eastern Sierras.  If you like lakes and really do not like steep climbing....this is for you.  Take a lunch and enjoy.

farther you went, the trail just followed the road so it wasn’t that interesting and saw everything we did driving in. No too difficult of a trail to walk', 'I’m 50/50 between describing this trail as a hike vs a walk. Regardless, the trail was gorgeous and we had a great time. We ended up doing the full loop, hiking about 5.3 miles in around 3 hours. This was my first experience hiking through Redwoods and this trail didn’t disappoint. The stretch driving from Saratoga to the park headquarters was also a bit of fun. Would definitely go back.', 'Definitely an interesting hike. Tree lovers will enjoy this trail. Slippery rock can be very....slippery as the name suggests, so casual wear like sneakers are not recommended. Imo the waterfall is okay. The atmosphere is great.', 'Beautiful trail.', ""Very calm and tranquil hike. Feels like a peaceful place throughout. Only disappointment was the semperviren falls. I wouldn't call it a waterfall. It is just a small drip of water falling off a rock. The entire height of the fall is about 5 or 6 meters only"", 'My first hike in this area. Redwoods were beautiful to view. Was disappointed we missed the falls as the signage wasn’t clear. The last half mile or so is on the road. All in all a decent shady walk.', ""We liked the hike, pretty and quite easy. A lot of trees! It was quiet despite the presence of people and the proximity of the road for half the trail. We missed the waterfalls, so if you want to see them, keep a eye on them on the map, because we didn't see any sign."", 'Half the trail is by the road , but the other half is a beautiful walk in the forest. There has a big hill you need to climb to complete the loop, but other than that incline was pretty mild.', 'I hiked this in April 2017. I loved being surrounded by the large sequoia trees. Nice trail, some hills but overall I found it to be a peaceful and tranquil hike. Very heavily forested with a nice waterfall.', '', 'If you want to spend an afternoon walking in the woods but nothing tiresome, this is your best choice. It is also kid-friendly.', 'Nice trail but crowded and too much car noise on the weekend', ""I live out in the valley so I am not from the Bay Area.. the reason why I say this is because I want to warn everyone about the crazy Bay Area Drivers that will nearly run you off the road as you try to make your way up and down this mountain.  It's a shame because the trail itself was nice but others are correct when they say it can be crowded.  I would definitely recommend Yosemite or Kings Canyon over this.   I will not be revisiting Big Basin simply because I don't want to deal with people tail gating and honking at me while I drive this windy, curvy steep road.  Please use caution and take your time!"", 'Super crowded, right next to the road.', 'Nice trees.  Bring along a map as the trail options are many.  No cell coverage on the trail (which is a good thing!)', 'Started at HQ. easy walk to the Sempervirens Falls. From there we took the Sequoia Trail up the hill and across the 236 to skyline to sea. That was much prettier', 'Large portion of the trail runs alongside the road which takes the serenity out of the hike whenever a car drives by. The second half after passing Shadowbrook trail was much better with road noise. Overall the hike was pleasant, and relaxing. Small detour to see the falls. I would rate this as an easy hike.', 'Nice easy trail with mellow elevation change. It took us 3 hours at a stroll. The waterfall halfway through is a nice snack break with a view. Highly recommended as an intro trail to Big Basin.', 'Sequoia Trail, Northern Escape Road, Redwood Trail totalling 6 miles.  Trail map and signage could be better.  Otherwise, we were awed to be among such beauty.  Recommend for 7 and up.', 'Easy to follow the trail with visible signs.

Very easy except for one small section where elevation gains and gets your heart pumping (assuming you start at the designated trail head). Waterfall was quite small. Saw one giant redwood tree which was fantastic. We hiked just before sunset so it was quite cool and fully shaded.', 'Great trail with waterfall point but alot if trail follows nearby campsite roads', 'The trail is clearly marked, it has 2-3 more difficult areas but overall it is an easy train.', ""Nice hike, but I would not consider this easy. We were told that it would be flat and good for kids, but it is decidedly not flat and far too long for our 3.5-year-old to walk on his own. Sure, there are flat stretches, but mostly it is up and down (not too strenuous) and lots of roots to walk over. The first half runs along a road, which, although not heavily trafficked, was kind of a disappointment and didn't feel secluded. The second half runs away from the road, which is better. Bottom line: If you have little kids, I would avoid this trail. Otherwise, it should be ok for most skill levels (except the one major uphill portion - see below). Here are some pros and cons overall:\n\nPROS: \n--Beautiful old growth trees\n--Mostly shaded, so nice and cool; back half gets a little sun exposure\n--Nice waterfall halfway (we were there in Oct, so it was at a low point)\n--Totally doable for most adult skill levels\n\nCONS:\n--First half runs along a road. It's not heavily trafficked, but it gives a sense of not being very secluded.\n--Not flat, as advertised. NOT suitable for young (under 5) kids. Just too long. \n--There is a MAJOR uphill climb about halfway through, where the trail forces you to walk up a steep rock face to join up with the rest of the trail. With a toddler in tow and a baby in a backpack, it was quite strenuous. The trail evens out again once you're up there."", 'Easy hike perfect for kids.', 'Easy hike to Sempervirens falls however the trail is alongside the road so not too secluded. We took Shadowbrook trail to loop back.', 'The trees are beautiful and the waterfall is well worth the hike. However, I would not consider this trail easy.

I don't like Sequoia trail, just a little bit upper than drive way, not like a trail"", '', ""Nice easy trail with plenty of shade in the hot weather. Looking for banana slugs was probably my favorite part of this hike, otherwise it was a little lackluster. I was hoping to see a larger waterfall (Sempervirens Falls), and more than just redwoods.

Great trail for beginners however."", '', 'I like this trail because it has lots of shade and you can isolate yourself from the busy world into these tall redwood trees. You can stop by a fall on the way on this trail by the way.', 'The trail is nice and well shaded. And Sempervirens falls detour is worth it. When we went there in March, it started hailing unexpectedly. For the most part, it runs along the road which sort of kills the whole being in the wild forest.  The trail is rugged but really easy.', 'Moderate. Falls can be accessed by road if you want to skip hiking.', 'was a great hike...all took about 3-4 hrs.  my only thing was most of the hike about the first 2hrs was a trail running along a road. we were able to see cars and people walking while on the trail...that kinda took the whole ""in the wild"" feel away at first...but  the second half of the hike was really in the woods...when I hike I don\'t like to see a road..just woods...but overall was beautiful and recommend doing it.', ""Great short trail, perfect for an afternoon hiking with my young son. Note the trail is 4 miles for the the loop, not 7.8 listed by AllTrails. Here's a few prominent features to look out for if you are hiking counterclockwise.\n\n1) A little after 1.5 miles in, you'll have an opportunity to take a detour off the trail to see Sempervirens Falls. The detour is so short that it is definitely worth it.\n\n2) Right after you visit Sempervirens Falls you'll encounter a quarter-mile section where you gain about 400 feet by walking up a steep granite face. If there's any moisture this will be very slippery. Wear good shoes, or try to stay on the dirt as much as possible.\n\n3) At about the 3.6 mile mark, you'll encounter a fork. You'll need to cross the stream and follow the path to 'Skyline to the Sea Trail' which you'll take south, the other path also leads to the starting location but is far less interesting. Alternatively if you're with a tired little one, follow the road south instead of crossing the stream for a quick walk back to the visitor center."", 'Lovely trail!

We spent about an hour on the wrong trail haha. Follow the directions from some of the previous comments. Enjoy!!', 'great trail second time this week', 'Great trail during late October.', 'What a great Sequoia “foothill” trail. It is rated as moderate but there are some hard spots. Since it had rained earlier in the week, there were no bees or wasps and very little dust. This is the perfect time to hike this trail, the falls may not be at their fullest, but leaves are starting to turn and some fall flowers were blooming. The trail head is at the very end of the Potwisha campground. If that parking is full, you can park across the road. We recommend good shoes and polls or a hiking stick. Cannot wait to do this trail in the Spring when the falls are full!', ""I accomplished this trail today.  Beautiful weather and few people there. Haven't hiked in awhile and it was a little rough coming down (wrong shoes). Deffinitely going to do this trail in the spring next time! No bees thst I noticed."", 'It’s a bit dry and dusty at the moment (Labor day weekend), but normally this trail is probably great. It was fine today - just quite hot and 6 out of 7 of us got stung by yellow jackets (there was a swarm right on the edge of the trail). We saw 3 rattlesnakes on the trail but if you spot them and wait for them to slither off it’s no problem. The falls at the end were nice (a bit small), but not 100% sure they were worth the effort and stings.', ""Out of all of the hikes I have done in socal thus far, this has been my absolute favorite! It's definitely a hidden gem. Took about 6 hours with a nice nap in the middle of the river atop a rock near the falls. I saw maybe 8 people the entire hike.  There is quite a bit of shade which is nice for those hot days and the falls at the end is a nice rewarding treat! It's so hard to go back to the park and not do this day hike."", 'was nice hike run into to bee hives but didnt get stun till the way back. water was cold but refreshing. Deer came up close as well as a bear cub that wanted to follow.', ""Be aware that there are large nests of angry and very territorial bees after approx 1.5 and then 2.5 miles. The first was about half a metre of the trail so not too much of an issue, but the second was right on the trail and completely unavoidable. Both my wife and I were sting multiple times - take anti histamines if you're going to do this till and be prepared to run past the nests."", 'Not as advertised. Very difficult hike, especially in the summer months because of the rare shade found for the greater parts of the hike. The elevation change is also closer to 2,300 feet and round trip it is almost 10 miles. The falls are gorgeous at the end but with the poor air quality in the park and the fires in the nearby areas, it was difficult catching a full breath the whole time. Would not recommend for inexperienced hikers.', 'Awesome hike! Trail was a bit of a challenge. Ran into a large doe with two fawns about halfway in. Had to make room because momma wasn’t having it. None the less awesome views and the water was amazing definitely recommend!', ""After our plans to reach the Mineral King area today fell through, we decided to do a hike in the foothills instead.\nMid-June, the temperature was easily in the 90s and there isn't much shadow along the way, so be sure to carry a lot of water and wear sunscreen and a hat if you're doing this in summer. Long pants also come highly recommended, as the trail is narrow and there is a lot of undergrowth. \nThe hike itself is not terribly exciting for most part - you don't get much in the way of views and, especially in the summer heat, it can become a bit of a slog. The waterfalls are quite pretty though. \nOverall, I would say that there are better hikes to do in Sequoia, but if you want to experience the climate of the foothills, this is not a bad hike to do."", ""BRING LOTS OF WATER. I would recommend long pants because there was nettles and poison oak along the trail and overall my legs got itchy from rubbing against the dry brush. Trail is narrow and loose so make sure you've got a good footing. Some areas are shady and some parts have no shade at all. Was an awesome hike and the falls are beautiful! We finished our hike in 5 hours. Oh and a FYI, the trail starts in a campground. There were no signs for it."", 'Completed this trail on July 22, 2018. We were on the trail by 8:30am and completed it in approx. 4 hours. Our total time included about 25 min of rest at the falls:) Trail has some great shady portions, but quite a bit is full sun and quite hot this time of year. Trail is definitely narrow and has steep drop offs close to path. Hard to pass if you come across others. Would not recommend taking small children. I would not rate trail as hard for those who are able to move well and are sure footed. It does have a variety of terrains such as rocks (both loose rocks and secure rocks embedded into mountain), sandy, slick dirt, leafy bedding, water, and fallen trees, all of  which require close attention to footing, balance and the ability to shimmy around bushes in some pretty narrow passes where the trail is washed out a bit. I would recommend long pants AND a pair of good hiking boots. There were LOTS of rattlers sending their warnings out this time of year. Did not SEE any rattlers but they were very close to the trail. We did encounter a water snake at the falls. It was laying on the rocks in the pool. Be cautious if you choose to take a dip. I highly recommend this trail and suggest you go all the way to the end and spend some time enjoying the falls! Absolutely worth the hike!', 'Very very hot, but absolutely worth it. Took a dip in a pool by the waterfall to cool down. Great. Saw a small snake in the water.Did not need long sleves and had plenty water with me.', 'This hike was fairly challenging for someone who is used to living at sea level and could definitely have used some more time to acclimate to the climate and heat...but it was worth it. Hiked for what felt like forever and and soon as we got our first glimpse of the falls, we knew we had to finish it and touch that water. They are beautiful! After arriving at the falls, set up a spot on the rocks to take a break, have some snacks, rest, recharge, and enjoy before beginning the journey back.To echo other recent reviews: minimal shade, need lots of water, two liters a piece at minimum and covered legs are a must. I was ok in a tank top but for those that don’t want to risk it while brushing up against over grown plants, long sleeves are a must too.', 'This was a great day hike but I’d definitely recommend an early start to avoid the worst of the heat if you’re doing it in Summer, as more than half of the trail is in the full sun. We were prepared with plenty of water (2L per person for us), sunscreen, and insect repellent. Despite the heat we were both wearing long pants, which I would definitely recommend because of the scratchy burrs that kept attaching themselves to my pants (and would otherwise have been scratching my legs). It took us about 2 hours each way. It’s almost all uphill on the way in and then almost all downhill on the way out, which is exactly how I like to hike :-) We saw a deer on the trail, and some hikers behind us also saw a rattlesnake. Some parts of the trail require caution, for example at some parts near the falls the trail is eroding away a bit, and on those bits I’d rate it as hard, not just moderate. But overall we really enjoyed this hike.', ""Pros:- Great views of the valleys and trees.- You can hear the river/falls for probably half the trail.- Not very crowded.- Plenty of shaded resting areas at the end of the trail.- Great for a day hike.Cons:- The trail is very narrow. It's difficult to pass people coming the opposite direction.- Plants are growing into the trail, and if you're wearing shorts, you will get scratched up. - I would not recommend this in the summer! I went in June 2018 and it was way too hot. At least half the trail does not have shade. Because of the heat, there were a decent amount of bugs. I stood under the mini waterfall at the end to cool off, and it was so hot that I was completely dry in about 20 minutes. I hiked this trail last November too, and enjoyed it much better then."", 'My least favorite hike ever. Little to no shade along the trail. The trail is incredibly narrow and hugged a cliff. Spider and who knows what else infested bushes that rub up against your leg. We probably only made it about a mile before bolting back to our car. Two of our friends made it to the end and they did not seem to enjoy it either. They said the waterfall wasn’t worth it. If you do decide to do it, bring a LOT of water because it can get hot there (especially in the summer). I wouldn’t waste your time on this one. There are so many other amazing hikes in Sequoia! We hiked it July 2017.', 'Moderate hike with mild elevation gain. The hike is mostly on a narrow trail with dried pokey plants on either side. At times I had wished I had worn pants since my shins were rubbing up on all the plants. Meeting hikers can be semi frustrating when trying to get by one another on the trail. The trail has some nice views and I actually came across a deer having breakfast just off the path before it wondered off into the brush. I also came across a rattlesnake on my way back to camp when it was sunbathing in the 90 degree sun. Marble Falls is lovely and I had to put my sunglasses on because of the bright white reflecting back me. Not too many people in the morning probably due to the hot weather. The trail has some portions of shade but is mostly out in the sun but bring plenty of water if you are hiking this on a hot day.

Waterfall was amazing! huge reward at the end :)', 'Interesting hike , not sure why it says that you can bring dogs, you cannot. It is inside a National Park and it’s even signed not allowing dogs.

Great place to stop afterwards and get a drink and some food .', 'Good Hike. For a 1500 ft elevation gain , this trail had a gentle grade than most other comparable trails with similar elevation gains. \n\nThe trail is mostly shaded - about 75% and the falls at the end of the trail is delightful.

Worth the effort on a winter day .', 'Great trail and cool temps helped make it very enjoyable.  I would not recommend for the casual hiker.  Trail is very narrow at times and rocky.

Hard, but reward awaits at the end.', 'This trail was recommended to me by a friend, he said it was pretty easy and roughly 5 miles round trip...

My favorite hike ever! I've done at least a dozen times and I still enjoy it. During the spring, the snow melt makes for an amazing waterfall.

Any one who visits Sequoia should do this hike!"", 'Fun hike, the waterfalls and marble at the top made it very worth the hike.

Worth the hike.', 'Beautiful falls at the end really made the hike worth it', 'A great walk in the woods with incredible scenery. Not sure I would quite rate this hard but there are some narrow ledges with fairly big drops. Go slow and watch your step as you should do with any elevated hike. Highly recommended!', ""Beautiful hike.  I was surprised at the amount of water in the river for this time of year.  This hike is rated as hard but I wouldn't say it was too difficult.  The elevation gain is gradual.  Lots of beautiful views of the mountains and rock outcroppings.  The waterfall is a cascading style with smooth marble rocks."", 'Beautiful hike to the falls!

Agree with recommending no dogs due to foxtails.Flies are pretty bad last third of the trail. Seemed a bit  longer than 7miles but would rate it moderate (not difficult). Definitely a trail I would recommend.', ""The marble rock falls is the best feature of this hike. In september it is dry and brown. Very little green and the bugs were very bad.

Hard on knees and feet so wear good shoes."", 'Great trail... took it mid August it was hot and dry but getting to the end of it was worth it. The way back was easier totally recommend to intermediate just to push a little harder and take 2 or 3 (5 minute) breaks will help!

I would rate it as moderate, it wasn't very steep at all. VERY hot depending on when you go, a couple small creeks throughout the hike just big enough to get your sweat rag wet saved us.

Beautiful waterfall at the end with safe areas to get your feet wet, though the water is literally freezing cold so we didn't get all the way in."", ""Completed this hike in April and enjoyed it thoroughly. There was a low hanging fog hovering over the falls which was very cool. No crowds. The parking sucks and I got bit by a tick despite dousing myself in bug spray. Other than that, loved this hike. I have no idea why it's listed as hard. It's not that long, it's not that high, and it's not that steep."", 'For being my first trail, it certainly was difficult but was such a beautiful view! Underestimated it for sure, take plenty of water! Like 6 water bottles. The earlier the better, that way you have more time to enjoy the water fall', 'Very nice trail, some washout in a few spots but totally tolerable. Somewhat busy (midday Sunday) I saw 4-5 groups had turned around and 3-4 more on their way up as I descended. Got pretty chilly at the top near the falls.', 'Hiked this today. Beware:  Ticks and Foxtails. Had to go directly to the Vet for foxtail in dogs ear and picked ticks off both of us even after taking precautions. Other than that it was a great trail and the river was raging.', 'Love this trail. 7.8 mile total. 2,800 elevation gain. Not kids friendly. Pretty tough , single trail over the drop off. Last 200 ft you have to scramble over rocks . View of the falls are amazing. It was foggy , misty and raining on May  17,2017 . Saw a few hikers on trail otherwise pretty isolated.

Just be prepared for inclines. Overall a good hike. Took about 2 hours to get to the waterfall at the end. Very refreshing tho."", ""Good day hike, pretty easy. Climb up a bit and you'll find a nice pool to swim in."", ""This was a hard trail, especially after we had done half of another trail. It was really tough on the legs and ankles due to the roughness of the trail. Didn't help that the trail was all ascending until you turned back either. Heard and saw a rattlesnake way too close to the trail for my comfort (It was right off to the side of the trail). It did have some amazing views though."", 'Wow. This was a tough trail. Maybe because we did it in the summer....', 'hiked 01apr2017. ~65 degrees. the trail was mostly dry and there was about 40% coverage in the shade on the way up after starting at 10am.the water falls towards the end are very nice. you can climb on the boulders a little which is fun.', ""Beautiful trail that's easy and fun! Great photo ops everywhere!"", ""We have done this several times. It's always beautiful, but best time is April May.....the spring flowers are amazing. Up hill most the way"", 'Rugged trail but absolutely worth the hike.  If you decide to take it on during mist or rainy conditions, be careful of the rocks and mud on the slanted trails, not much room to slide', 'It was tough going the one way up for me because it was mostly uphill but the waterfall at the end of it is totally worth it. Took 1.5 on way up, 1 hr down. At this time conditions are nice. Lots of shade at the end portion near waterfall.', ""Great hike. Not too challenging. Perfect amount of time and a waterfall at the end is always a nice treat.  bring your inner tube.

A little tuff at first but a very good work out!', 'Hiked on 2-2-17 A solid hike i have  done this hike a couple times before and it is wonderful worth the 3.7 miles to the waterfalls one thing i noticed this time around were the ticks so many of the them hanging on to the grass if you stopped and looked close you would see alot i ended up with one on my chest when i got too the falls i noticed him and removed it i would strongly recommend a tick spray i heard  Permethrin is good for that just a heads up', 'It was nice hiking this time of year, it has been a few years since we have had this much water. It was nice to hike this without the summer heat. Great day hike.', 'This trail is not meant for hiking in the night nor is any trail for that matter! So make sure and get to your destination leaving you with plenty of daylight to return while you can see! Lol! This is a moderate trail, for those who considerate easy my hats off to you. But a BEARRY x(3) experience!!!!!!', 'Marble Falls in winter is amazing. The river is still running but is pretty small so instead of an amazing large waterfall you get to waslk on and explore the actual marble bed of the falls. you have to scramble for 5 minutes over some boulders at the end of the trail. Just continue upwards andc you will be rewarded. The marble looks like snow. If you go post pics as I didn\'t have my phone with me Look for the ""turkey leg"" formation', 'I wouldn\'t classify this hike as an ""easy"" hike, but more of a ""moderate"" hike. I\'m not saying it\'s Mt Whitney hard, but it\'s not Big Tree Trail easy either. The terrain varies from smooth path to smaller rocks to larger rocks to tree roots to leaves covering the path. It\'s narrow as well, maybe 2 feet wide most of the way up. And once you get within a mile from the falls, the mosquitoes get pretty persistent and annoying. Avoid bug spray as I swear it attracted more of them, just keep moving. It didn\'t help that we started this hike in the early afternoon either as the temperatures rose over 90 degrees. It felt more like a jungle hike (heat and greenery views), the closer we got to the falls. But once you actually get to the falls, it\'s worth it. There was nobody there at all and this was Labor Day weekend, though we did see a couple groups going up to the falls on our way down. Saw a couple fish swimming in one of the small pools. It would be a great place to backpack and spend the night. It\'s more of a forgotten hike, since everyone keeps driving along the Generals Highway to more popular spots and misses it. Day hikers should park across the Generals Highway from Potwisha Camp ground, look for a sign that says Dump Station and park there. There are bathroom facilities there.', ""Great hike. You're pretty much going up most of the way in so its a little more difficult. The way back is cake. Takes about 2.5 hrs if your at a decent pace. The end is beautiful with nice waterfalls and nice places to lookout as you're hiking in."", 'Falls were spectacular.  Undergrowth encroaches on the trail a lot. Still enjoyable hike.', ""Hiked it at the end of May. Not only was the waterfall going full blast, most of the trail was lined with wild flowers. For us, the climb wasn't that bad.\n\nIf you use the app, the GPS directions will take you about four miles too far, and tell you have arrived when you are in the middle of the road. The written directions above work much better."", 'Wonderful in the middle of May', 'First I will start by saying that the end product of this hike (a roaring waterfall in the Spring) was well worth the hike.That being said, be aware that this is a 3.5 mile hike in, almost completely up hill all the way in, and of course completely down hill all the way out.Also, this a skinny trail on the edge of a hill. Not good for kids. I took 3 twelve year-old boys w me and was constantly worried that they were going to slip and fall off the side of the mountain, which at many points of the trail would have been deadly.With the exception of the scarily narrow trail, this is a fabulous hike. Lots of beautiful flowers in Spring time, not too long, a good work out, and only 1 hour from my home town of Visalia! We are truly blessed to have easy access to such marvelous nature that the Marble Falls trail has to offer!', ""Love this trail. The falls are beautiful! The trail itself is pretty steep and we went in March this time so there wasn't much to see on our way up(I would recommend going in April/May, it's a bit warmer but so much prettier)but it's totally worth it in the end. The trail gets pretty rocky and more level the closer you get to The  Falls and there are lots of boulders to sit on so you can take in the view. The Potwisha campsites are 10 minutes from the trail and the Marble Fork Kaweha River is right next to the campsites. It's so beautiful out there and I would definitely recommend this trail to anyone!"", 'Nice morning hike with moderate incline and sun.  I imagine this would be extremely hot in the summer months,', 'Great hike! Beautiful views and the waterfall is amazing! Not too difficult and just the right duration for a day hike. Definitely will be back :)', 'Great trail, well maintained, good views of the foothills throughout.', ""Great out and back trail to hike in the winter, though keep an eye out for poison oak. Ok for hiking in the summer, but watch out for rattlesnakes. There's also some really good hiking just across the main road."", 'Trail is available year round. Personally hiked it yesterday and it was December 6th. 95% is going up, not too stressful though. Destination is 100% rewarding. Waterfall is strong and gorgeous!', ""Did this in my youth more than 2 decades ago.  I have wonderful memories of the beautiful ferns alongside the relatively easy trail.  As always then as now, lots of people during high season crowding the pools.  Don't remember ticks on the trial, but, probably just didn't see them.  It's too bad that many beautiful wilderness areas are infested with these little monsters.\n\nWould love to revisit during tick and toursit low season, tho."", 'Beautiful trail in the spring! Make sure to bring lots of water as it still gets warm, even in the Spring. Came back to the campground around dusk and ran into a couple of deer that allowed us to be with them for around 10 mins.', 'It was an awesome trail for my first time hiking! It does require you to push through as it seems to never end, but the vistas and the marble falls at the end were well worth the hard work! :) highly recommended for beginners! :) bring plenty of water, and a few snacks!', 'Great trail with lots of shade and occasional wild life ', ""Very nice but long trail. Not a difficult trail, but it's very long. Take plenty of water; we refilled out bottles at the actual falls - which were amazing by the way : )"", ""Awesome trail. The falls are really nice and when you're there you don't want to leave. Will be doing it again"", 'I have done this hike a few times. The first time was late in the afternoon and the sun was blazing down on us for most of the hike as there is not much shade on the first half of the trail. Bring lots of water and sunscreen, wear a hat even better! This is a fairly steep incline the entire hike, once at the top however you have beautiful pools beneath rushing waterfalls. Decent hike, great view at top. Saw some deer on the way down that we had to follow behind for bit. Paid no attention to us. ', 'Marble Falls was the first moderate hike that I ever did.  It was hot and the group I hiked with was FaST.  A good workout with a waterfall at the end.', 'great trail, not too much traffic.', 'Nice trail. My 5 year son walked the whole 7 miles with ease. Great family hike. Trail head is at the back of potwisha campground. Alittle tricky to see. ', 'Lisa\'s right on. For years I\'ve referred to this one as the ""tick trail"". The best time to do this low elevation trail is anytime other than summer. Winter and spring also seem to be the best time of year for ticks. Wear light colored clothing - you can see \'em before they gain a ""foothold "". This is largely a hike thru chamise. Not ""drop dead"" spectacular , but has a couple of superb vista points along the way and the falls at the end are nice. Keep an eye out for some auto parts along the final leg of this trail. I believe they\'re from a car wreck dating from the 1950\'s when a family tragically went over the edge of the highway high above you. ', 'A friend and I hiked this trail yesterday, Veterans Day, and saw only a couple people the whole day. Beautiful scenery and plenty of water in the falls and creeks that crossed the trail.  A few swarms of gnats but no big deal. The only thing that kept it from being perfect was the fact that you went in and back the same trail-- oh, and the tick that came back with my friend!', ""My husband and I did this trail right after Thanksgiving in 2010.  We kind of got a late start on the trail so we had to head back fairly early.  We didn't go all the way to the falls because there was still snow towards the end of the trail (higher up out of the valley), plus it was rocky and I didn't feel comfortable pushing it with my 8-month-old on my back.  We could see the falls from where we stopped.  Since the weather was a bit chilly, it kept us comfortable while on the trail and we only saw maybe 5 people max the whole hike.  It's mostly a steady incline on the way there so coming back is a breeze.  We were trying to beat nightfall so we completed the hike back in half the time we took to hike up!  I really enjoyed this one and would love to do it again when there's no snow so we can get closer to the falls.  I'd also llike to make it an overnight trip and camp in Potwisha Campground (where the trail starts).  The views were really pretty and the trail is pretty lush.  We saw one doe.  "", 'This was my first hike of any distance to speak of.  I hiked the trail a total of four times this year with the last being 6/25/2011.  Like Melanie I did not know what to expect the first time and fitted myself with what proved to be an uncomfortable fanny pack with insufficient h2o. According to the National Geo computer program it was slightly over 1700 feet elevation gain. The numbers for the distance varied widley, however the sign at the trail head said 3.9 mi one way. I enjoyed the diversity, of the terrain and the shade canopys that seemed to pop up just when you needed them.  The reason the 25th was my last hike of the year for this trail is the amout of rattle snakes I encountered during my last hike.', 'This was my first hike so I did not know what to expect. It was tough since I am not as fit as some people. The water fall was beautiful. ', ""The trail was pretty crappy but it has a big finale. \n\nThe trail was filled with more bear scat than I've ever seen in my life, there were a number of rattlesnakes on the trail, and the entire time I has surrounded by swarms of face gnawing gnats. \n\nIt was the worst trail I've ever hiked.\n\nThe only reason why I'm giving it two stars is because:\n1) there was almost no one else on the trail \n2) the marble waterfalls at the end of the trail were actually very beautiful.\n\nThe falls were a series of smaller waterfalls with wonderful green pools and white marble. \n\nSince there were so few people on the trail, I jumped at the opportunity to take a dip in the emerald pools. The waters were surprisingly frigid, but it was refreshing and it helped to soothe the gnat bites.\n\nUnfortunately it is an Out and Back trail so I had to go back through it all again get back to the

It is the only Indian Canyon that does not have palm trees, but is abundant in other plants, such as the wild grape. Before you head into the canyon it is interesting to know the story behind it:Tahquitz Canyon is named after the Cahuilla Indians story of Tahquitz, who is a nukatem (a spiritual being) created in the being by the creator Mukat. Tahquitz was the first shaman and was a spiritual guide to many Cahuilla shaman. But, he had a bad side too. He would steal and eat soles, and was blamed for earthquakes and floods. Tahquitz Canyon was the home of the Panik Agua Caliente Cahuilla people, who also lived in Palm Canyon and used the hot spring in down town Palm Springs. ', 'Wonderful hike!!! Worth the money.........$12.50 for adults, $6 for kids 6 and up (5 and under free). The scenery and hike into the canyon was beautiful!!! The whole time you follow the winding water up to the source, the Tahquitz waterfall. The last 1/2 mile or so is almost all up, some steep steps, until you get to the waterfall and wading pool below it. Water was freezing since it was from the melting snow in the San Jacinto mountains :) The temperature was 101*F that afternoon so the water was nice to wade in and cool down. There are plenty of places around the waterfall to have a nice picnic lunch before heading back on the loop.

This trail had a little bit of everything- views from above, a forest, flowers everywhere, and even a little creek at the bottom. We went counterclockwise and found it more enjoyable.

We found it easier to go left (2nd intersection) on Whittemore Gulch Trail instead of continuing right on North Ridge trail. This way we were able to enjoy more of the woods. Either way, the two trails meet eventually, and you continue onto Whittemore Gulch. *Be warned: going down on Whittemore Gulch means you will be going up on Harkings Ridge, which is mostly out in the sun. If it's a hot day, it might be a better idea to do this loop clockwise. There is a really nice area at the midway point (where Whittemore Gulch meets Harkings Ridge) to have a lunch break. It's right behind the bridge. There were people on the trail, but it wasn't overwhelmingly crowded, and every person we saw along the way was very nice.

Lots of shade, smell of pine and earth. Saw many banana slugs too :) On a clear day you can see Mavericks in Half Moon Bay. The return up Harkins Ridge trail is steep but there are small plateaus along the way that provide short breaks. Agree with other reviewers that you should bring more than a bottle (1 liter) of water to be properly hydrated. It took 3.5 hours to complete. There are bathrooms at the trailhead parking lot and at the bottom of the valley just before you head up Harkins Ridge trail.', 'Great day hike! Amazing views while going down.', 'Beautiful trail with great views. Definitely should be rated ""hard"" due to the steep hike down/back up again. The redwoods and creek that you see at the bottom of the hike are worth it though!', ""Had a great time here again on 12/3.This home has it all from redwoods to sun baked grassy hills to a gulch with a creek and moss laden undergrowth at the bottom. Some yellow banana slugs to be seen too though I'm not particularly fond of slugs, even brightly colored ones. :) The return climb is tough. I was exhausted when I ran into another solo hiker on the last mile. That company made the last section fly by.I'd say this trail is more fun with friends than solo."", 'Loved the views and the deep forests on this hike!

There are open patches where it can get really hot but there is enough shade to keep you going.', ""This is a decent trail but not spectacular. We did it clockwise and the elevation on the way up is pretty good. I will say, not sure how this is 12.8 miles.

We parked at North Ridge and the hike uphill towards the end was hard.', 'Absolutely gorgeous trail! The views were spectacular, including the banana slugs along the path. One note of caution: if you have injuries or limitations around inclines, coming up Harkins will be a challenge.', 'Great hike. Went after a week of heavy rain and wind storms and the trails were all in tact, with just a handful of muddy spots.

Took us about 3 hours to complete the hike', 'I took the Whittemore Gulch trail down which provides great views, shade and an easy trail. Coming back we took the Harkins Ridge trail which was steep and challenging with great views and sunny sections on the trail.

So the first half and the valley at the bottom around the creek are really nice. The valley is probably a good place to relax and eat. The uphill hike back will be your ""payment"".', 'I did this hike yesterday. It was a great hike. I happened to get a date that was beautiful with great views of half-moon bay. I would recommend that you park at the bottom (the sea side) hike up the hill and then come back down. Yesterday we parked at the top so we had a really easy start to the hike and then it was much more difficult getting back up the hill after you are tired.', 'Nice trail.  Great views from up top and a serene setting down in the gultch.  This is definitely not a walk in the park.  As some of the other reviews say, it is one heck of a climb back up.

The last 3 miles are just plain brutal if you are not in shape for tons of stair climbing; that's how steep it can get.

Hiked this again July 2018. Glacier point to the valley floor.  So  far, this is my favorite of all time.', 'Love this hike. Great views.', 'Beautiful scenery. I took the Mist trail and my toe fingers were killing me when I ended this trail.', ""This is mostly a fantastic hike, I was lucky enough to get a ride up Glacier Point, from there, it was 2 miles down a mostly sun drenched trail (sun block up before starting) with few small rocky section.  This part of the trail will offer you spectacular shots of half dome, but also SE parts of the park that you don't normally see.\n\nAfter this, you do few small switch back into small forested area that also has a bridge across Illilouette Creek.  Being early fall, it was trickle of water and easily could forded.  I sat down for small lunch for about 15 minutes before heading up into the section of the hike where you traverse upwards for the next miles.  While uphill, this is still a good well maintained section of the trail and won't cause much in the way of hurt to you.  It's mostly dirt, but does have some rockier sections then first 2 miles.  It's semi forested, so your views will come and go, but again this a very pleasant section of the trail to hike.\n\nNevada Falls is of course a great view too and you can now look down the slot (per say) back to the valley too.  It also get's a lot more crowded with hikers having come up the falls rout.  I had the second part of my lunch here and took in the views for maybe another 30 minutes.  I wasn't really looking forward to the next section as I'm old and fat.\n\nI couldn't find the Muir Trail (winter trail) and found myself having to take the Myst trail instead.  The next 2.5 miles are almost all on either granite stairs, or worse, granite rocks.  Granite as a whole isn't so good on your feet, knee's or pelvis, and when it proper stairs, it's easy slip on, so for this section I used poles.  I still ended up on my ass twice in the broken granite sections.  Ugh.  For the stair sections, they can drop quite a bit and will really give you knee's something to scream about.  Remember, you're dropping (or climbing up) about 2000' over 2 miles, so it's steep and kind of unforgiving.  The section immediately down from Vernal is all deep stairs and not very wide, so you're also going to have deal with lots of hikers in this section too.\n\nThe last milish was standard trail again as you make your way back into the valley.  For this time of the year though, you should bring some mosquito spray, otherwise you'll be blood sucked (like I was).\n\nIf you haven't done this hike, you should.  Ya, even if you're old or fat like me.  If i can do it, so can you.  Just give yourself more time and bring along enough water and Ibuprofen and you'll be fine."", 'I recommend the Muir trail vs the Mist trail.  The stairs are killer', 'Hiked from the Valley floor up to Glacier Point to the falls and into Half Dome Village.  About a 16 mile hike.  The views were spectacular.  Hiked on 9/16/18.', 'Go during the spring when the waterfalls are massive! Can be a very crowded hike on the weekends', ""My wife and I hiked this trail in reverse from Glacier Point to Nevada Falls in July 2018. The Panorama Trail provides you with magnificent views along the entire trail. Be sure to bring extra water in the summer months, but if you have a filter, then there will be locations to refill bottles or bladders along the way. Bring some trekking poles as the switchbacks from Glacier down to illilouette falls is littered with large rocks and some sharp drop offs. I advise taking the reverse route as in and back, because you get some great early morning shots of Half Dome and all the falls, but in the evening when you return, you can watch the sun set on the face of Half Dome from glacier point. It will make for a very long day, but it's definitely worth the work. The trail is moderately trafficked, so be prepared to pass or be passed by other hikers, and expect to see others at the falls when arriving. There is an area between Nevada falls and Illilouette falls with some very large boulders that make for a great photo opportunity, so bring a camera! Have Fun"", 'Fantastic hike with ever changing vistas.  Left at about 830 AM on July 11th from Glacier Point Panoramic trailhead in summer and finished by 230 to the valley via Nevada and Vernal falls and the Mist trail.  Stopped numerous times for photos and lunch at Nevada falls.LOVED the first 6 miles during which our lizard count to other people count was 65 to 7.  After Nevada falls this ratio flipped as people way outnumbered lizards and trails became very crowded.  The downhill out of Nevada and the Vernal steps is a knee killer w painstaking foot placement required.Besides the last 2 miles of knee pain and crowded trail down to the valley (which is expected in summer) this was absolutely amazing hike great vistas of Half Dome and El Capitan and numerous waterfalls..', ""Out of all the times I've been and hiked to Yosemite, this trail was the most spectacular view wise. Multiple angles of the park from the high sierra to the valley had me blown away. Even with it being 90+ degrees, this hike was worth it from beginning to end. Will never forget my experience and encourage everyone to do this hike."", '一一', ""After reading some of the reviews here I decided to include this with the Four Mile Trail and do this as a loop. I parked my car at the Half Dome Village (as close as I could get it to The Mist Trail which I would be using as an exit). I then hiked 2.2 miles back to the entrance of the Four Mile Trail and proceeded up that 4.6 miles to Glacier Point. Epic views of Yosemite Falls the whole way. I then hopped on the Panorama Trail and took that 5 miles to Nevada Falls where it junctions with The Mist Trail. The view coming down from Glacier Point is absolutely incredible. You can see all the way across the valley and the path you will be taking to Vernal and Nevada Falls. One of the things that sold me on doing this loop was that I read that the Panorama Trail was mostly all downhill. There is actually a 1.5 mile stretch right after Illilouette Falls that goes uphill that had me huffing and puffing. 3.2 more miles down The Mist Trail..those waterfalls are amazing. And then a 1 mile zombie walk back to my car. Best hike I've ever done!! 16 miles altogether. Took me 7 hours."", ""We did this trail two days ago, went up to Nevada Falls and then came back around on the John Muir trail. One of my favorite hikes! It's really crowded in the beginning, but after Vernal fall's it's way less people. We started around two and we're done by seven. This is my fourth time doing this hike. The two waterfalls are spectacular!"", ""I ended up doing this fragmented, starting from bottom, and eventually being from glacier point. I think it can be worth doing the whole thing from the valley, giving you a great view of halfdome, and feeling like you deserve it (instead of driving there). Plus, it takes a while to drive there, so you won't lose so much time, especially if the parking is full and you have to wait an extra 2 hours like I had...."", 'Hiked from glacier point to Nevada Falls and then hiked all the way back. Let me tell you, YOU NEED ALOT OF WATER. Your legs will hurt so take those hiking sticks with you. I had to take a couple of breaks because of the incline. Overall great trail, but you must start hiking early. I started around 11, and finished about 6pm.', 'So is 9 mil round trip or 9 mil one way!!? And how long is takes to complete the hike?', 'Sublime! Besides the awesome views, mist, and enormity of experience from such perspectives as are offered on this route, it was a treat to finally see the enormous bird that we heard for at least a half-hour making an odd fog horn-like noise: a blue grouse!', ""Awesome trail I've been able to do a couple of times..."", 'Amazing when waterfalls are maxed', 'some spectacular views of the yosemite valley. I hiked from glacier point to Nevada falls and back up to glacier point.  2nd day, hiked sentinel dome.

Best day of hiking in my life. This trail is ranked #1 in my books. Beautiful! I can't wait to do it again!"", ""Great Views of Yosemite Valley! We'll work the 8.5miles to the top of Glacier Point!"", ""Took this trail on the way down from glacier point after taking the four-mile trail up. The views are amazing and it's a great hike! Challenging by the waterfall but so pretty!"", 'Intense hike with breath taking views. Took me 6hrs for the round trip.', 'One of my favorites at Yosemite!', ""This is an AMAZING hike. I did it in the opposite direction--from the valley floor up to Glacier Point, and then came down the 4-mile trail. The whole 14-mile haul was quite strenuous, but the views were incredible.\n\nThe beginning of the hike (near Vernal Falls, especially) is packed with people--but the mist from the waterfalls keeps you cool going up, and the falls are well worth seeing despite the crowds. Once you get past Nevada Falls (heading towards Glacier Point) the crowds thin out substantially. You've also done a substantial portion of the uphill by that point, though past Nevada Falls there's a switchbacking climb, a bit of downhill to hit Illilouette Falls, and then a final uphill push from the falls to Glacier Point. (The last uphill mile felt really tough. I don't think it's actually that steep at that point, but the trail there is sunny and I'd been hiking for a while.) The views of Half Dome and Yosemite Valley along this trail were awesome. Highly recommended, but pack lots of water and snacks. I had a great summit picnic just before Glacier Point!"", 'Really good hike. Just the the overview reads up top - phenomenal views. Poor CA air quality can ruin some otherwise great photo opportunities. I started my hike at 0600 sharp and ran into a doe after the first switchback less than a 1/4 mile down the trail. Just prior to Illilouette Fall ran into a big Black Bear (rocking the summer coat no doubt) on the trail itself. Went for about another 1/2 mile up and it felt like uphill switchbacks so decided to head back to the truck. Getting back up there about 0930-10 and the parking lot was beyond packed. If you plan on doing this hike highly recommend you start early and bring a buddy (or some bear mace).', 'Great hike started at about 7:30 am after a 2.5hr drive,  well worth it.   The falls were over flowing due to the bad winter and a lot of snow,  at one point one of the falls was overflowing and created a waterfall over the trail which we had to hike through,  one of many times I got wet... but it felt good.  I would advise getting there early, as the park tends to fill up making it impossible to park.', 'Truly amazing hike. Just remember: bring sun blocker, mosquito repellent, good hiking shoes, plenty water and there is no regular shuttle bus  between Glacier Point and the Valley so add almost 5 more beautiful but challenging miles to your hike.', 'Stunning views of waterfalls and famous peaks on this trail, views that literally take your breath away. You get to cross Illilouette Creek once and the Merced 3 times, once at top of Nevada falls, once at top of Vernal, and last at the Vernal footbridge. These crossings lend a lot of charm and interest to the hike. Make sure you have good shoes. The footing can be quite slippery at many points along the way, plus the almost relentless downhill can be a toe-buster if your feet slide forward and your toes jam up against the shoe. :( Add 1.5 miles if you opt to take John Muir (from Clark Point) in the final stretch instead of Mist Trail. And I know a bunch of the reviewers thought the trail was moderate, but for this 46-year old in moderate  shape, it felt closer to difficult.', 'you get WET!', 'Take your time enjoy it', 'Take your time enjoy it', 'Take your time enjoy it', ""We did the Panorama trail on the Memorial Day weekend and it was just spectacular. The waterfalls right now are gigantic and the trail wasn't crowded at all. We hiked up to Glacier Point and then did the trail back to the Valley. I wouldn't consider this hike being difficult except for the steps along the Vernal Falls at the end of the trail which can be quite slippery and you really need to pay full attention after hiking for a couple of hours."", 'So I decided to convince my group of friends to do this hike from the Valley Floor to Glacier Point Rd in the middle of August. It was ambitious, but to this day it is one of my fondest memories of Yosemite. The incline was really steep to get to the falls, but I would say there were about a few miles here and there where it was relatively flat switchbacks. We started our day early and I think it took us about 6.5 hours to complete the hike with breaks, lunch and pictures, Stunning scenery and there is an incredible feeling of achievement when you reach Glacier Point Rd and you can look upon the panorama trail and be able to identify all the falls you hiked past. If I were to do it again I would have done the hike in late spring.', ""Just finished this yesterday. Great hike! If you're coming from Glacier Point down the hike should be rated as moderate. The only strenuous part coming down from Glacier Point was after the Illilouette footbridge. It took me 2.5 hours to get to the top of Nevada falls and another hour to get down to the bus stop. The person who said it was potentially a7 hour hike from Glacier Point isn't quite right. 7 hours is insanely long for this trail! It was a somewhat busy trail; I passed between 30-40 people between Glacier point and Nevada falls on a Friday afternoon. Overall it is a beautiful trail and I look forward to doing it again. If your feeling up to adding some milage to your hike you can head back towards little yosemite valley/JMT. It's very beautiful (but wet) there behind all the different domes."", 'AWESOME trail with the best views of Yosemite. TONs of waterfalls and creeks. Some tips to pass along from our first time in Yosemite and doing this hike. \nTake the Glacier Point tour bus to the top! Make your reservation online first to secure your spot. We were able to park in the first lot on the left when you turn in to get to Yosemite lodge. Park there and head over to the Tours desk to pick up you tickets. Once at the top make sure you spend some time there! Head over to Glacier Point and get a good view of the valley and falls. Then you\'re off! \n\nThe trail was busy at the start but lined out after 1 mile in. It will get buys once you start getting closer to the falls. The Mist trail is VERY popular and crowded. If you are worried about getting ""misted"" bring a light weight poncho that will cover you AND your pack. \n\nRecommend stopping for lunch and the top of Nevada falls. Also because from this point on its allll steps down. You can refill with water at the bottom of Vernal Falls if you need - though you nearly to the end at this point and a majority of the trail is paved from here. \n\nOnce you pop out at the end of Happy Isles trail, head left. If you\'re tired get in line for the free shuttle that can take back to the lodge. When we were there the shuttle line was 3 buses long according to the ranger. So we opted to walk. Since it was 5 pm shuttle are usually VERY full and can often get stuck in traffic, even though they are supposed to come every 20 mins, it is more like every 30-45 mins. So enjoy the flat, paved 2.2 mile walk from the trail head of Happy Isles back to the lodge. GREAT hike!', 'Incredible views and a lightly trafficked trail between Glacier Point and Vernal Falls.  We first started with the Four Mile Trail to Glacier Point and then the Panorama Trail to Vernal Falls and back down to the valley floor.  Amazing hike with incredible views the entire time. Would highly recommend', 'Ah-freaking-mazing. With the rain this year the falls are ridiculously beautiful. Took John Muir trail to Nevada. There is a ""new"" mini waterfall to get to the top of Nevada so be prepared to get wet. TOTALLY WORTH THE HIKEI would rate this as moderate. Straight up with switchbacks. I\'m an avid hiker and fitness enthusiast. Great workout for the day!!! DO NOT COME TO YOSEMITE AND NOT DO THIS!!!!:):):)', 'a bit challenging, but totally worth the entire hike. Bring plenty of water and some snacks, when you reach Vernal falls take a Lil break if needed, and than continue to Nevada falls.', ""An amazing day hike.

Don't give up before you reach Nevada Falls - you will be rewarded with the view and most wonderful falls."", ""Excellent day hike trail with plenty of spots to stop and enjoy the views.

I absolutely loved it! It is definitely a knee buster though. Especially if you happen to have a dormant knee injury that you forgot about. It was an absolutely gorgeous experience starting 3,000 ft about the yosemite valley. (I would recommend parking for free in Yosemite Valley and purchasing a one-way ticket for the Glacier Point Tour Bus, which is what I did). Going in late spring meant there was a lot of water going through the falls and it highly recommended. Going down the Mist Trail had its problems for me with my knee injury but I got through it. Those steps are killer, and a bit scary. If I had my knee brace I would have been perfectly fine!', 'Great trail I think it was more moderate than difficult. It was beautiful and I would definitely go again but in the spring instead of the fall.', 'If you can only do one day hike in Yosemite this is it. Panorama Trail through hike to Half Dome Village.

Took Four Mile from the Valley to Glacier Point. The hike has a bit of elevation, but the overall 14 miles was a breeze compared to El Capitan & Clouds Rest. I really enjoyed the scenery throughout the entire hike. I'd vote that it has better views and scenery than El Capitan, but nothing even close to as epic as Clouds Rest. If you're willing to knock out this much mileage, I'd highly recommend going the extra distance for Clouds Rest."", 'We started at Glacier Point and hiked down to the valley. Awesome views!

This is quite possibly the best trail in the park as far as great sights, and variety in a single day.Alltrails describes this as a loop trail. It's not a loop, either a one way point to point or an out and back if you want to go both ways. I would highly recommend you do it as a point to point as the out and back would take quite a while.

My nephew loved the views, the entire time he was says ""Wow this is so amazing"" ""this is the coolest hike ever"".  \nUnfortunately since it was August both Nevada and Vernal Falls were dry. I recommend hiking this trail in spring time so the water falls are flowing well and you can get cooled off while hiking down the Mist Trail. If you are really looking for a long endurance hike you can try to accomplish Half Dome from starting from Glacier Point taking Panorama Trail  to Little Yosemite Valley (Above Nevada Falls). I plan on completing this hike several times a year and recommend this hike to my friends. Everyone will love it. \nVery few hikers till close to the Mist Trail.\nPS.

Some parts might be tricky during high tide so be mindful.', 'It was well worth the millions of rocks we had to walk through. We recorded about 6.5 miles total maybe because we took the long way. I’d recommend coming back up past the shipwreck to just walk a regular path back which was probably around 3.3 miles.', 'Loved the solitude. Extremely rocky but brautiful. Ruined a boot and was saved by a cole haan shoe that I came across and salvaged the lace. Be wary of the tides', 'I took the drain pipe down to the shore and veered left heading to the shipwreck. It’s a long haul through often unstable rocks. I would not recommend this part of the hike for small children and dogs, nor would I recommend hiking this section alone unless you are an experienced hiker. It would be very easy to turn an ankle, and I had no phone/internet connection while I was at the shore. Once you reach the shipwreck, you have the option of scaling the cliff wall with hands and feet (dangerous and not recommended) or turning back to go the way you came in. Either option is unsavory if you are injured or exhausted. In the end, I’m glad I went. The wreck had some creepy factor to it which was fun, but I would not do it again by myself!', 'Had a good time. Started at the parking lot right where Paseo del Mar splits off from Palos Verdes Blvd. There are a couple of ways to go down the bluff but I ended up taking the Drain Pipe way. This trail is hard only in the sense that getting down and back up the bluff is a shuffle and the whole trail is on rocks. Would def recommend taller hiking shoes for ankle support and cushy socks.', 'Great, beautiful challenging hike. My family are all avid hikers and this one was a bit difficult because of the rocks. I have weak ankles and even with wearing hiking boots with great support, two days after the hike it feels like my ankle has a mild sprain. However, DO NOT let that keep you from going on this hike! I loved it so much! We went down the area with the ropes and followed the shore all the way past the shipwreck and then up the steep hill back to the road. We didn’t stop at all because we were concerned about high tide closing us in, but we were still out there at high tide. The path was pretty narrow in some spots, but didn’t keep us from going through. We loved all the little crabs in between the rocks as we went! The only thing that I wasn’t too fond of was the seaweed. It was very slippery!  We took a 8 and 10 year old. The 8 year old had a hard time by the end, but he doesn’t go on as many hikes as my son (the 10 year old). If you just want to see the shipwreck, I recommended going backward on the trail from this map and then going back. It’s much shorter and easier for those who don’t want to deal as much with the rocks. We started about 8 am and finished about 12 pm.

I highly recommend this hike!!!', ""This map leads you to a trailhead that is about 3+ miles from the shipwreck.

At the beach there is only one way to follow. It takes you left and you get to do some climbing if you want. The views are amazing and yes there are rocks to walk on, but it’s not that bad. I almost didn’t do this hike because of all the reviews about the rocks being terrible but there’s enough of a path where everyone has walked that it’s just fine.

It is worth the view to jumble through all the rocks. Careful footing is needed especially as you draw closer to the wreckage. Algae and beached kelp make the best places to stand close to the ship slippery. Come earlier to hike, I suspect the heat of mid day amplify the nauseating aroma of rotting seaweed and hobo piss.

However, the rocks are slippery, so don't go too quickly. The day I went, there was an inordinate amount of kelp flies. Literally swarms of kelp flies and they were everywhere by the smaller rocks. Less so by the larger rocks, but I also ran into some swarms there, though not as dense. There were also so many insects that looked cockroach-like, perhaps silverfish, but they were everywhere.

Maybe moderate, especially if you are going to scramble up and down the rocks much.', 'Love this trail!  Fun and scenic hike. Our teengers loved it. During low tide, the tide pools are a great added adventure. Hiking down to the very rocky beach is easy, going back up will increase your heart rate :)', 'Good hike! You walk along the beach but there is barely any sand, lots of big rocks you have to walk across. Lots of cool tide pools and treasures along the way!! Make sure you have good tennis shoes for this hike!', ""What a great adventure! \nPhysical hike with high awareness of foot placement, balance, some slippery areas over kelp cover rocks. Definitely go at low tide, best to wear high top shoes/boots with traction. Parts of the hike are smelly with flies and so what! Very fun exercise hike.\n\nVery cool rocks, shells, tide pools, birds, surf, beach art, relaxing cove rest stops, boats, P.V. cover surfing, lots of photo opportunities,\nAnd the shipwreck!!!! So cool!\n\nTook my son and I an hour twenty five minutes to get there with lots of photo and tide pool stops and 1 hour return with fewer stops. Spent about a half hour photographing the shipwreck. It's a great day.."", ""This trail is pretty rough going. As people stated before the majority of the trail is walking over large and loose rocks which makes for slow going. Also, you want to be sure to go at low tide so you don't get wet. However, the trail is very pretty, there are some cool tide pools along the way and the shipwreck is pretty neat. "", ""I've seen this hike and other portions from Malaga Cove to Pt Vicente Lighthouse in many books and web hiking sites with hardly a word about the hazzards or dangers that one could encounter while attempting them.  1st, unless there is a very low (negative) tide forecast while you're on this hike, it should not be attempted in its entirety.  Getting caught at high tide on some portions of this hike could be life threatening.  The sheer cliffs could prevent an escape from the rising water.  Even if timed well getting around some the points resulted in getting very wet or a death defying climb up and around on loose rocks!  2nd, for large portions of this hike your walking over bowling ball type rocks that could easily lead to a sprained ankle or worse.  Good sturdy shoes are a must and the hike probably shouldnt be attempted solo.   3rd there are large amounts of trash and other things that wash up on the shoreline that could be safety hazzards and would be considered disgusting by many. I will never attempt the whole distance in one trip again and most likely would also never attempt more than a few mile jaunt without a hiking partner.  \n\nThat being said, the shipwreck area was interesting and Lunada Bay was a spectacular cove. The hike is strenuous based on the terrain and the attention you must give to each step.   It took me 12 hours to get from Malaga Cove to the Fishermans Access area and back via PV drive to my car.  6.3 out of 10."", ""I was creeped out. There's a lot of dead animals lying around. The trail is like 90% rocks so you are seriously starring at your feet. I had comfortable hiking shoes on & my toes were dying from this hike. I don't think this hike is worth it. In order to enjoy the view, you have to stop & sit somewhere. I'd recommend Abalone cove in Palos verdes that's near by. "", 'Great views however you are stuck looking at your feet and trash the entire hike because of the rocks. By the end my toes and ankles hurt from stumbling on the rocks. Hiking back was a NO NO! So if you want a short enjoyable view take a small trail located at Lunada Bay and the shipwreck is about a 15-20 min hike away.  ( I wish I took this to begin with).', ""I thought this hike was pretty good, but the others in my group didn't agree with me. The ENTIRE trail is along the coastline and is very rocky. You have to watch your step or you can easily sprain an ankle or lose your balance. I'd say if you want to see the shipwreck, take the North trailhead at 2300 Paseo Del Mar and head south. Much shorter hike (1mi total). Be careful, though. You'll have to scale the cliffside on a very steep trail. Be sure to wear grippy shoes. A woman in another group was wearing Uggs. Not smart."", 'NIce Hike, we started out at ""bluff cove"" and hiked in from there, it was a rocky beach most of the way but we new that going in, so we made shur to wear good hiking boots. along the way we saw allot of see life & surf shacks. You start seeing pieces of the ship along the way about a half mile before the main wreck, altho there is little left of the ship its self there is still some big chunks left, along with a rusted up tractor', 'The steep bluffs and rocky shores are beautiful, but the walk out along the rocky beach is tedious. I was unaware of the terrain, and wore my running shoes - nearly twisted my ankle on several occasions. Also, there were LOTS of flies swarming around decaying seaweed and a dead seal (this is just nature, but still swarming bugs are not my ""thing""). It was a good workout and fun for a one time adventure, but there are lots of better trails around so I\'ll likely not be going back...', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '',
